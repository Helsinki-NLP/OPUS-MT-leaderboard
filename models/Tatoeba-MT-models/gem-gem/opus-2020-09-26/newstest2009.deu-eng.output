The Prague Stock Exchange crashes against business conclusion in the minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
The Prague Stock Exchange was linked to the entry from Monday at the beginning of the Tuesday business when it dropped by another six percent points.
This time was the reason for the entrance at the Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Representative House, which had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there, is also shown in the Czech Republic.
Case of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, a dramatic case experienced the shares at the markets in Asia, although the indices were able to compensate for some of the losses over the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but later it was possible to compete some of the losses, thus reducing the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, which observed the movement of Chinese shares at the stock exchange in Hong Kong, decreased by 3.8 per cent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares at the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then decreased the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchanges in Taiwan decreased by 3.6 per cent according to the index there.
"The timing for the rescue action in the United States is insecure and will influence financial markets worldwide," says the Head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
The American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, as the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, and approve the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that other countries would also be affected by the infringement.
A bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system for which up to $700 billion (atmost 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the request of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush believes that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilise the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main share indices recorded the biggest break-in in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index decreased by nearly seven percent, a similar breakdown he had last recorded in 1987.
The index had decreased before the vote, but there was hardly evidence that the draft of the House of Members would not come through, the index experienced a free case.
Congress admits: US Government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
The vote on this should be taken at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators achieved a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in a range of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
However, this does not mean victory yet.
The Congress delegates have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they may publish and vote on the end of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services said this to Barney Frank of the Reuters Agency.
In the Senate, different data may probably be voted on the plan at the earliest Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the living of the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "reflection" because of the complicated mechanisms, how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on how a package for the stabilisation of the market should look," said the Agency Bloomberg, democratic Nancy Pelosi.
According to their words, there could be an end vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met on Sunday with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson in order to give the Government Fund its final form.
This provides for a sale of unsaled mortgage assets from financial corporations, which will cause financial companies to fall into severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we are at the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis is also significantly declining in the share markets.
According to the words of the democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the lawyers are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the convention.
This is because it is the aim of reassuring investors before businesses on the Asian financial markets located in the first time zone, where a decision from the Congress might affect the businesses on Monday.
But to date, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is no clarity about whether the negotiations in the last minute could still be a problem.
Legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
But the law will find out some changes.
The total amount for aid to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion are to be made as soon as possible as President George Bush demanded.
However, the convention can block the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush is positive in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the convention can agree its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remains to be founded on the basis of funding for purchasing poor mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to pay back their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The Representative House should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, then the Senate on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress made from Saturday and "estimate the two-sided effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Restriction of gold fallscreens
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate Christopher Dodd, the leading dealer, stated that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called golden fallscreens for the directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee which is to be supervised by the Fund.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan also expects with a help for householders who have problems with repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new councils on mortgages that they buy up, with the aim of reducing the monthly cost of the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's why, because you don't know what mechanism and the price of the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses between each other," said Marek to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of the next week, Mareks view is not crucial.
"It is much more important that the congress delegates agree to support the plan and that they voted in favour of it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on adoption is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
Duell on Messers Cut: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you in your choice
While almost every mobile MP3 files can play, no MP3 player can still call.
That is why, of course, it looks like it's better to buy only one phone.
Nevertheless, there are enough reasons why you should make yourself an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and claims of future owners.
Surely you are hard to buy for home a great expensive record player to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of at least one of them.
This is also the case with music on travels, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For the one it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink floyd fan is probably hard to get headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is widely featured.
The lifespan of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do they don't even make it pointing out.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephoning and simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better one, once a worse photo device, and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communications, you have almost a little computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can barbecue and no television photograph.
But the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your cell phone, the more you will have to load it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy freers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (particularly the simplest) are clearly more powerful.
Therefore, in the cheap mobile phones, you should expect them not to play music for more than a few hours.
If you then call from time to time, buy yourself a charger for the office for security - that also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even those less good keep at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time charge.
Another problem then exists when you want to overplay the music on your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB shutdown, and not any mobile phone without specific software can be connected directly to a PC.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will complete without reducing the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves place a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can use more
When selecting a specific device, you should investigate especially after the lifetime of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound, and of course also the comfort of use.
Is music for you mainly scenes and hears them every day just shortly, for example, in the roadway, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What really can be almost every cell phone.
You don't have to check what music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widespread, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to call the corresponding sites of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can acquire a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument for why a musical handy should be employed.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and is usually limited to fast radio heats.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that just this kind of sale of music (which is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will in the future dominate the music industry.
Most of the phones are carrying.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always have headphones or at least a wireless free call.
If not, you can react to the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The best advantage of the music mobiles will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent walkman.
The largest handicap will be for most people that no normal headphones are there.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3,5-mm opening for normal headphones cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
The advantage of the player is again in the light control.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity of operating with the previous normal cassette recorder or, for example, the plate player is obvious.
There is no threat to collision in the form of an incorrectly employed mobile Internet and a subsequent horroring invoice for data transfers.
What device should you take now
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, two thousand crowns range.
But pay attention.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB storage cards.
If you already want to have a mobile phone and buy another cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Be among the more demanding listeners, take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the control comfort is thus accessed to one single MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum to 35 hours) offer MP3 players of the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The telecommunications market in Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer practically all the services they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider who forces the classic at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile telephone providers are working on the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTU, which pointed out that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming fees, there is so likely a paradox situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a fighting response.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, but in Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telecommunications providers are pleased to shame over the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with his own network has no more specially many chances (and he would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual provider.
Just the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market led to a significant reduction in prices, which the classic mobile telephone providers had to respond to.
There were votes similar to those in the United Kingdom before the entry into the market of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile.
However, it has proved that there is room for such providers and that these can really be successful.
Moreover, you do not need to look for examples long.
In February we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just one half year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the five largest provider of the country.
The Penta financial group, which has U:phone in Czech Republic, is behind Mobiling.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in UK offers SMS at least half the cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good draw to put on a non-scientific target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Every guy choose Mobilking - the provider that they like and which they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could be taken into the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offer."
In Czech Republic without chance, the mobile phone providers mean
However, it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile provider conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very hopeful.
It will be more likely to enter the market of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says a telephone conversation for mobile.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile telecommunications providers in the Czech Republic are not specially adapted to this thought.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything for no potential competitor.
Your interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has long been showing the GTS Novera group, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only fixed networks but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this opportunity with all Czech mobile telephone providers.
With some of them we were already able to achieve negotiations," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Not official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an inconvenient wall of silence.
"In this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-quality virtual provider in Czech Republic.
The Czech market shows great specificities to other markets.
We have not yet been addressed by any subject with a complex and serious project in this area," says his Declaration for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Srše ́ from the Telefónica O2 press department.
Further suppliers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare conformity with the O2 statement: "To date we have not found a viable and both sides of advantage that could be built on."
And she adds: "In the network of T-Mobile, hardly a virtual provider will appear until the end of the year.
At this moment we have to have a specific offer to think so short-term."
Vodafone rather focuses on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we view from the customers as the best.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The operation of mobile telephone providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thereby also to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be facilitated to enter the market?
That the providers can draw on a string when it comes to something, it also proves the long Hin and Her about the creation of U:fon.
The strongest pressure toward ČTÚ went out from the company T-Mobile at the time U:phone came on the market.
This also demonstrates the publicly available information from the ČTU websites.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitiveness of the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the entry into the market by a fourth mobile telephone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would make high demands on the market itself and, above all, on his services."
However, in view of this approach by mobile telephone providers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is amazed.
It is not only the attitude of the ČTU, which, unfortunately, has no competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, in contrast to the United Kingdom and other high-developed countries.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
This, however, refers to its very typical attitude on this whole problem.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after the conclusion of a contract between a mobile telephone provider and a virtual provider through the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far no such contract has been concluded because the offer of potential stakeholders is likely not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," says in his answer to our request Kristián Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formation would not be surprised by representatives of the suppliers.
Of a authority representing consumer interests, and, among other things, to ensure that no one misuses its position on the market, this is more than concernful.
Particularly when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it is necessary to observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a lower price is likely not part of the interests of the UOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost already touching conformity of the three mobile telephone providers, resulting from their reactions.
The question is whether it is really just a coincidence.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the tank stations is surely only coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his trade on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing by the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTU, after telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile telephone providers have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile phone provider has - logically - the monopolie for his network.
It means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a certain segment.
However, even if you do not take part in this argument, it should be a warning for the UOHS that three mobile telephone providers are considerably similar.
In this respect, complaints of a number of stakeholders (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) show that they are facing very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The resolution of responsibility to the ČTU is then a very common trick in telecommunications services, which distinguishes the ÚOHS from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Novelle of the Telecommunications Act has not succeeded in extending the competences of ČTU in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts have promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS need to know that too well, but they are likely to have other interests.
It's okay if no one looks at.
Unrespected remains the functioning of any pseudovirtual provider of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies who issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
It is normally companies operating in multilevel marketing.
For example, own mobile telephone services offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies are usually only selected.
The joke of the matter is that the company acts as a classical company that orders a large amount of SIM cards to the operator.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the conditions of use of all Czech mobile telecommunications providers prohibit a similar retail sale.
"If there are cases that you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will be discussed, which can lead to the end of cooperation with the corresponding society," answered Martina Kemrová on our question on this issue.
It is, however, quite unlikely that such a thing is not true with the person responsible for the mobile telecommunications providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such action.
The activities of these companies do not lead to negligible profits, at the same time, they are not affected by the actual official marketing, unlike the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický recalls potential problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, although the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their names, so they cannot fully have such information as the normal customers of mobile telephone providers."
But the ČTU would have to be at least strange.
There is also another question for the UOHS.
The mobile telephone providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they locking up against a virtual provider?
It is added that the UOHS has quite strong competences to discover such activities, and if it does not want it, it does not have to satisfy the declaration of the suppliers, they don't know about it, and their conditions would prohibit it.
When Czech Republic is no longer expensive
As the text has already emphasized several times, the entry into the market of virtual providers led to a significant decrease in prices in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have been created, classical providers have tried to prevent their creation almost more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the high-developed countries, however, in these moments, the regulatory bodies acted, which did not even try to preserve the interests of mobile telephone providers, but who tried to preserve their customers.
If it was by formal measures or by non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and followed further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing into the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot disclose the impression that unclearness in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is true and a virtual provider appears soon, the Czech mobile market may soon move back.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (discrimination).
And the Czechs will not finally call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my home country at the day of the Czech Government in an hour of celebration.
The Hymne was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologsang, in choir circumvention and in a instrumental version.
The song record took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Already earlier he had told the Czech radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are significant and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear dictation, so that you can understand the text well so that a consensus can arise," said the conductor.
The Czech national hymn will be conducting its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov měj first heard in 1834 at the stage of the standing theater in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, which came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first stroke of the song became an organic part of the national hymn.
One of the seven government symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How sounds the "new" hymne?
The Prague transport operations also transport to a chip on Wednesday for the first day
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport operations as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon instead of a paper carrier in the pocket in a subway, railway or a bus will enter.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people possessing the chip card opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or a year-coupon (valuable from 1 January 2009) and play it on their chip card at the information centres and branches of transport operations at the subway stations Muzeum, Městek, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letěany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons have also been available via the Internet since yesterday on the pages of the transport operations www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the U-Bahn stations where they have to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper carriers.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it will be played on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places the traveler is also available to a switch with trained staff, who consults interested people in the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrny.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on self-management machines on the opencard that are fitted in some subway vails.
How do such machines look?
They are red, remembering drivers, the passengers may have noticed them already in the U-Bahn stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty until the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automatic instead of the driver
The control of the automatics that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays out of itself.
The electronic coupons apply not only to the capital, but also to the surroundings from tomorrow.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Middle Bohemia to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague integrated traffic, train-companies have reader equipment with which they can check the validity of the coupons after time and zone," explains Filip Drápal by Ropid's organisation. This organisation compils the route plans for Prague transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the cartridge at the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card shall be placed at a marked place on the side of the box.
Thus the driver controls the validity of the coupons played.
"Will a passenger check the validity of the played coupons, is nothing easier than the driver to ask for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who is not driving buses and no longer knows when the coupon's validity ends, can go to the self-control machines where the coupons are played on the map.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is shown on the display of the device.
The Sudetes demanded a national decision from the United States
In 1945, the South Germans had requested the association of the Bohemian forest to the United States.
This is seen from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South-Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the rule of the United States of America.
With such a desire, some groups of South Germans were supposed to have approached the US presidents in 1945.
This includes a letter that remains in a private archive which is stored today in the collections of the South-Bohemian scientific library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken on the basis of the München agreement by Hitler - to the Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be sure of the words that the American units enter into, not as oppressors and enemies, Germany's territory, but as a freer," says a letter signed with the words "Men who are at heart the fate of the Sudetes".
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia makes sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech National Charter - suspected that it would expect grossity, inconsistency, inconsciousness, oppression, and slavery, the writers of the letter would ask the American Presidents to take over the forest for today and forever.
"We can't believe that without considering the view of a quarter million inhabitants of this area you're speaking to a foreign state for us, who tries to suppress and eliminate minorities, and has not contributed anything to the victory of the Alliances," is read in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposed to be the fear of revenge of the Czech oppressors.
If the US President doubts the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he would initiate a national decision in Bohmerwaldgau about whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the United States' protection rule.
Although the text of the letter in today’s knowledge of the postwar history may sound something naive, some time witnesses believe it is a good picture of the then expectations of the South Germans.
Although the Bohemian Germans had to know at least that they would negotiate their departure from the Republic, only a few of them admitted to such an opportunity at all.
Some waited for the United States and the UK to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, derived from Budweis.
He was in the war as a Budweiser German at the Marine at the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British prison at the end of the war and was brought to a war camp to Holstein, thousands of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would fit them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that he would be distributed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is addressed to car drivers
The most expensive action for safety in the streets in the Czech history.
This also features the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš θebíček promises to take riders of dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, movie, internet, but also on flyers.
She is supposed to take the drivers away from too faster driving and alcohol.
And they also remind you to gorge themselves before riding.
The campaign wants to speak in conscience especially to young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and, in particular, professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" stroke of the entire campaign also shows:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "not to think" stand in uppercase letters on a sign.
And in a blood laugh, the word "pay."
This should mean that one can pay a moment of ignorance with his own life.
The spots will be shocked by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the angel Saksian countries, where normal images can be seen with dramatic recordings of accident victims.
It promises that the numbers of accidents and the number of traffic deaths on the Czech roads will decline.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and peeds for car drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is applicable to sugar bread and whisky.
Sugar bread means they save time, for example when they drive on red.
The Peitsche is then the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce Martin Kořán Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
He believes that less effective are tables that make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably soon leave the environment, and the drivers will no longer see it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The Chairman of the provisional Israeli government of Ehud Olmert has stated for the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan hills, when peace with Palestine and Syria can be concluded in exchange.
He emphasized this in an interview printed on Monday by the Jediot Achronot newspaper.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it is necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to return to the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israelian region) because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to abstain from a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and thousands of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bearers and holy and historical places" located on the territorie of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Deduction from the Golan hills
Olmert spoke for a decline in Israel from the Golan hills, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also require some effort on the side of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to conclude with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan High Peace," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they need to abstain from to get back the Golan hills.
They will have to refrain from their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with (Shitic) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they grant to the terrorism of (Shit) Hamas movement, the Terror Network Al-Khaida and the Djihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” specificized the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a remote bus, it is not allowed to circumvent
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and travellers can walk and walk on the bus while travelling.
"If we wanted to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says the speaker of the Transport Ministry Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a two-two-year-old stewardes last week was likely caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the road to the bus.
The young woman was sitting at this moment at all accidents next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places available.
However, a bus may also have an accident or a sharp brake in the moment the Steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
One role is whether the bus is equipped with the vehicle letter even with standing spaces.
If this is not planned in the bus, travelers must sit.
The student agency's travel buses have no places to stand; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this first did not agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this has been withdrawn, and we have come to a consensus that travelers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their seat," he informed his position.
The law doesn't know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a Steward - no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there is no law which prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the concept of vehicle companions, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the speaker of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Joseph Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product authorisation also has standing places.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with steering spots and a higher allowed speed and distance buses without steering spots with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP professional for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on a bus.
"With a liquid route, there are not many dangers, the situation is similar to the service on a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulencies come, and the Stewardess can hit the head."
"Bring a bus sharp, however, then the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a roadway.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the transporter by means of internal rules," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to strike the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services from Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not even consider his profession risky after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the job of the Steward is risky, I will strike it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travelers when they arrive.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the Director of Asiana Alexej Litvin founds the lack of Stewards in his bus, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have steward foods, but we've been resistant from the beginning.
Earlier or later this ends with some fatal accident," he had not expressed a year ago for Tyden.cz.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young Stewardess from the Pilsen region was destroyed, which had worked for the society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off without blinking from the strap and had locked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
That the two places had been sold for the Stewards, Jančura provoked.
"These places can't be reserved in remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to accuse the truck driver.
With a compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judicial judgment, but it also expects a financial replacement from the debtor's side.
A change in law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of Stewards movement on a bus could lead to a legal arrangement at which a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport has been working over a year.
"This, however, has not yet come to a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the pointing system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the road," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport considers the activities of Stewards not to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," says Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, the letter of the WestLB board to the staff of the house does not lack.
By merging the units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkasse Financial Group" could arise, it says in the letter published on Monday.
The WestLB took a "competency block" with sustainable yield into such a business.
And at all, such a link could be the decisive incentive to further unions in the national banking sector.
This is how it reads if a board wants to demonstrate actionability in difficult times.
For the WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission but also from the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Institute, which has recently been clarified by the North Rhine-Westphalia Government, the time is urging to find a future solution.
A link between the Deka bank, which has known spare cash customers because of their investment funds, as always, and the WestLB has been talking for some time - also on Frankfurt's side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas informed at the presentation of the half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house at the Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is held by half of the national banks and the Sparkassen Associations, has instructed the Board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The conversations have been openly, so it says at the financial site, just started.
The Deka Bank, which is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt' financial area with its 3000 employees, is not for the first time speaking of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, the Deka bank seemed to be able to merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba for a moment.
However, it was nothing from this Trinity.
Nearly the plans had become public, the Hessian government opposed the involvement of Helaba.
The two other houses did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been repeated thoughts about a connection of the Deka bank with national banks.
However, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games about a meeting with his house.
Independently, however, it seems to be mature to know that a collapse of the various houses of the public-law sector is necessary.
After the Landtagswahl in Bayern is over, first of all, the BayernLB could draw closer to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, the partners gradually go out for it.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has been far better through the financial crisis than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, an association with the West LB, the Sparkasse- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, who is involved with the Helaba with 85 percent, has placed a rigel at the beginning of the year.
Stay at least the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are, however, only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the various business models of each house fit together.
In June, Merl expressed the decisive question of the business model to ensure the future capability of Landesbanken, had not been answered by the German Sparkasse and Giroverband.
At the end, the West LB could also be destroyed, but it was not desirable there.
So in the letter of the Board of Directors there, it is also spoken of a "complete solution" for the House at any rate.
As this can be brought under a hat with the merge of individual units with the Deka bank, it will still appear.
The second weighing weekend is known as "Italy Weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena as his girlfriend joins, and so be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter bier phase of the Emperor brand, a massively built gardener stands and proves to the approximately 200 October festival travelers, which deep sounds can produce his throat.
Elena gives Luca a kiss first, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking area next to the station Puorta Nuova, starts four buses this evening at 23.45, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses are especially reserved for the Italians, in a bus traveling exclusively Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking area, the South Americans are singing alongside their flags, they have celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, that's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitate feed and a glass with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have gone to the October festival, three tours are this year alone.
In the night, day-to-day on the whistle, back at 10:30 p.m.
Survival would only mean unnecessary foods, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the journey, the welcome drink with emperor beer, broken faithful to the Bavarian cleansing order, the health insurance and the German-language travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in wooden churches, where several other buses with Italian marks are putting a break on the motorway 8 shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at the parking area near the Theresiense at half seven o'clock in the early time, the 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final talk, explains the attack plan.
First, set up the yellow chip.
This is left on "October Fest", in Fraktur, and also the Internet address of Marcos Travel Office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "If the doors go up to the beer cell, it's running!" Marco calls in in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we're blocking, and not all the yellows on the same banks, in the room!"
The measure, crying Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget about drinking money.
"The security officers show that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight, find point half eleven again here!" Understand?
And it's gonna go to the whistle.
On the way, a yellow caps bind to the trees, to signs and even to the election plate of a large Bavarian people's party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It's the second wake-week, known as "Italy Weekend".
There is no precise data on numbers; the talk is of 50 000 who are on the way over the Alps and fall into the beer cells, 10 percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is reinforced by seven police from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bayerische Rote Kreuz, leading a national statistics where the Italians (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical services are first placed.
Especially popular with Italians is the courtyard.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, underlined the Federal Financial Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also urged the German banking sector not to be spared by the crisis.
For it has now arrived in the weekend.
The Munchner Real Estate (HRE), noted in Dax, receives a billion credit from a German bank consortium to protect from the turbulencies on the markets.
A familiar person said Reuters on Monday that credit aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only interest the part that it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
Background is losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he granted money, the State Financer had refunded extremely short-termly - which is now impossible because of distrust with the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's bar reserve had decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity rate had slightly declined from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current yields and net yields from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, the revenues from allocations to claims and certain securities, as well as the dissolving of returns in the credit business, decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher revenues from refunds from refunds of refunds from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the refund of interests in accordance with the tariff arrangements and from the business supply for group companies, the profit minus had fallen by about 16 per cent.
The former State Financer had, after his privatisation in 1990, first speculated with commercial real estate credits, which had then been divided into the Aareal Bank.
Because the classic government funding was too low, the Depfa had then increased its involvement in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (PPPs, private public partnerships) and international diversification.
To the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "a substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss bill, it is quite undefinite.
The fact is that the dividend has been erased.
It had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant government and infrastructure financer since the Depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the loans under the banks were largely decomposed, since the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate requires a part of the Depfa credit portfolio of a short-term refinancing funds per year - about 50 billion euros.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the funding needs of the group has been covered with the loan indefinitely and covers the company "from the influence of the currently largely inoperable international monetary markets".
From other sources it is heard that thanks to the funds the refinance was secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman George Funke stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the monetary markets at time.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But in view of the dynamics and imbalances of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unfair that the funding should not be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to be swallowed out.
After late Sunday evening, after the bank's report was still before the insolvency, the at least provisional salvation is not able to calm down the moods.
The share rate breaks by 75 per cent to €3.30.
However, the bond rates are quite well maintained.
If the priority debts are hardly moving, the courses of post-range bonds are more clearly imposed.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo are concerned and, understandablely, the durations beyond 2009.
Apparent Hypo-Real-Estate bonds previously a spectacular investment alternative, their valuability should be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system, after the significant exacerbation of the bank crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Depfa.
As long as the note banks, governments and less disadvantaged business banks are still ready to support the system, as long as a timely disposal of pensions can be assumed.
Or, however, that is what no one hopes to hope at present - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the sub-state reports, the probability of security is currently only a justified hope.
Above all, long - term believers should be able to make some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
In any case, short-term investors can use an endpoint to make a loss lecture for future remuneration tax payments on course gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16th day of the first school, the girls start looking at Tachibana high school: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
Already before school, I had Bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo to the Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I didn't go away.
The start of the school at Tachibana does not seem as strictly defined as with us at home in Niedersachsen.
The pupils were invited from eight o'clock until about twenty before nine a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the class began, I was about to introduce myself.
I am not the guy who likes to speak to people, yet before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I've dressed an old rock of my guestmother, including bleeding, blue knee bubbles and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm named Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in a week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language some two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all twisted, cigged and cryed and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'nearly, sweet'.
Then I'm hurried quickly in my place.
The girl next to me grinded pretty wide, she felt it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty calm, but when the Gong sounded, I was quite terrified.
Everyone talked together and cooked and asked me holes in the abdomen - thereby it is really difficult to understand Japanese English.
At the break, all of their bentos packed out.
My host mother had made me such a lunch box - that's something different than the destiny German breaks.
I had rice with herbs, little worsens, salad of gurks and algae, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Mostly I don't have a blast, what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely newly.
It's firm that everything is really delicious.
Well, up to the salty flowers that are placed, Brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
Sometimes it happens that a girl gives a self-prepared bento to a boy, which she then produces especially artificially - in the hope of getting to know the boys at the break talk.
That's what I read in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this too.
'Why calculated Japan?', my girlfriends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me."
Finally, I have been reading the most favorite mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also eventually began to learn a bit Japanese.
So for me, I realized that sometime I had to leave here.
Because I also have a fability for tradition, morals and practices.
And it's a great deal of value here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven't felt lost here anyway, even if Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Also rats have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep flee at risk means that she also feel fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same if they act like us?
The Internet journal " Edge" has published posts of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think true without proving it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions, without that I or anyone else could prove this until now where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least we can hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we apply to other species and circumvent issues of sensation or generally consciousness, we enter in inevitable areas because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat gets in danger, it does the same as many other animals: she is getting dead, fleeing or attacking.
People act similarly, and some scientists conclude a similar subjective experience.
I do not believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the side frontal cortex (as a result of its participation in short-term memory and the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much more developed in humans than in the remaining primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness depending on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature is expected to be in the linguistic nature of man: Since so much of his experience is linked to language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, you could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness was not dependent on language, they would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may have been created, probably differed very much from most of our consciousness conditions.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If it is, as something internal and subjective, neither measuring nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research poses great problems for us.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that might be more scientifically accessible.
It is possible to examine the consciousness processes of animals without considering their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the neural correlate of consciousness was rather than the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the performance of visualisation.
What is the result of the feelings?
I bring them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear will be activated in a conscious brain of his own activity.
So what we call fear is the mental condition in which we are, when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) has memory.
Thus, feelings are closely bound to the regions of the Cortex, the primates and especially the people.
As linked to the linguistic nature, fine grades of feeling occur because we can differ and classify with the help of words and grammar conditions, in order to attribute them to others alongside us.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the cortex and the brain tribe are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but more focusing on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it may be involved in cross-border feelings.
Theoretically, I can't contradict it, but I think it's unproofable.
Panceep argues what seems like fear in rats and people, is likely to feel like that in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they act similarly?
Does a sheep flee in danger if she also feel fear?
In my eyes, mere behavior similarity cannot prove experience equality.
Although the neural comparison continues: rats and people have similar brain stems, but sheep do not even have a brain.
But is the brain tribe responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to humans, how would you prove it with rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (which human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress is at the neural level, provided that the same is measured in rats and people.
As I do not investigate language and consciousness in rats, nor feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than constantly walking against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionist.
Uefa President Platini: Gnadenfrist for Poland and Ukraine
The Vice-President Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is much to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or restructuring of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are following.
The number of EMs may even be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We have to work with maximum speed now," said Ukrainian Association President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association of PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
It is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We insured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several first-personnel had been sentenced for manipulation to a forced decline alone in the past season, even the league start had to be shifted short-term.
Distressed Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in the interview about private things - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outet her profane Dennis Quaid as adulterer.
He's shy - and beat back.
Delayed Rosen War at the Ex-Pay of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now carrying out an uncomfortable conflict - in the public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan had first expressed the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has not experienced it until after divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryans press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unbelievable" if it was, said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News" that "I for the repeated time the story of our relationship is re-chaining and digging."
It is also "sorry" that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is once again "remembered in public the pain and revolts that mean a divorce for each child."
While Ryan lives alone since divorce, Quaid is again married and has recently become the father of Zwillingen.
And so closes his invitations with the sidesheeb: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that's best."
Lower prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights were cheaper in Europe than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more favourable - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant breakdown in the second quarter after an increase in prices in the first quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have risen for years, the nights in many places have already been approved.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 investigated European cities increased by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were about 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
As a cause, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "decreasing lust of American tourists".
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline of hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with a rise of 26.3 percent even hold the record in Europe.
Also at the flight prices, the trend in the first quarter showed upwards:
Due to the cereosinvasion, travellers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-term flights even became up to 29.2 per cent more expensive.
From April to June the prices for air tickets of the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, the price changes were far lower.
In Germany, prices broke even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price breakdown is, on the one hand, the delay in economic growth, explains the company.
The demand was broken in many segments of the flight market.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the USA and Europe, gives rise in competition pressure.
Signs of an excited situation are unprofitible routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that have signed bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - these were 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV strikes Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes table leader.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still not able to find a working elevator.
From Kristoffer Small Enlarge fraction landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came late to play and failed with a lifter to the Latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly to him about the lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," cited Hermann Rieger in the cabin of Hamburger Arena.
A lot wasn't loose in the catacombs, the half-time break was finished and most were sitting back on their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades of the physiotherapist of the HSV, enjoying a higher view than some of the blasphemed actors.
And so his request also found a hearing in a responsible place.
Assistant trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and endorsed the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's Chief Trainer Martin Jol.
Its command will have sounded similarly: Here with gate two!
The implementation remained.
"There wasn't a good look at everything today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have "delightened".
The 1:0 (1:0) have the Hamburgers to thank Mladen Petric's headball match (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol assembled.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall that showed their association as class primus.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to arrange this," said Marcell Jansen.
He realizes that the table-arched intermediate certificate stands more for the inaccuracy of the Liga than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torskytter Petric, and the Jansen devoted to FC Bayern - is slow, but they are not able to shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," asked Jol.
After voting downwards
On the Wall Street, it's about fear.
First messages from the failure of the rescue package let the Dow Jones interrupt at a time by 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow got something back.
At 20:30 p.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded with about five percent in minus at 10.579 counters.
Nasdaq's technological exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in minus.
The largest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, who had almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about twelve percent.
No track could win.
The stocks of the Bank Goldman Sachs gave up around ten percent.
Only a few days ago, Grand Investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called fake mortgage papers are to be provided.
But the sum is to be paid, not on a strike, but gradually.
In contrast, the State should receive share-option certificates of financial corporations which could be resolved in the event of the corresponding course development in order to reduce the burden for the State's cash.
Stock courses in Europe and the United States in the Downsocket
The billions of aids for banks in Europe and the United States do not remedy the doubts of investors.
The share course of the German Great Bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and breaks the Dax downwards.
The US-Index Dow Jones loses despite the planned saving of the financial market by the State.
The spectacular course losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have been deeply shattered by the German share index (Dax).
The monnik real estate financer's share lost three quarters of its value at a time, despite the Federal Government's and Private Bank's rescue action, the Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax stood clearly under the psychologically important 6000 points brand and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went into the knees.
The Wall Street opened in New York with clear losses.
Investors feared that the 700 billion dollars of the US Government's heavy rescue package could not be sufficient to bring back financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first trading hour or 3.3 percent at 10.809,25 points.
The US Representative House wanted to vote on the rescue plan that the vote in the Senate could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first gave up by 3.2 per cent, CAC 40 lost 2.9 per cent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index Nikkei fell by 1.26 per cent to 11.743.61 counters.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng-Index rose by 2.1 percent to 18.286,90 points.
In India, the leading index of Sensex lost 506,43 points or 3.9 percent and ended at 12.595.75 counters.
In MDax, shares of Arcandor were issued after announcement of capital increase.
The Private Bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The Trade and Tourism Group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space zones
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused unfairness: Dark matter affects the speed of space suns during the so-called Swing-by-Manöver.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years the space zone "Ulysses" fled through the space.
Because of soon frozen fuel pipelines, you are now threatening the cold death.
For years a mysterious phenomenon among scientists has caused confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie.
The Swing-by is a flight manöver of space sunshine, where they receive additional swing in the gravity field of a heavenly body, such as the earth.
This allows the sins to save much fuel.
The European-American Research Zone of Cassini-Huygen used this physical trick as well as the Sun Sun Ulysses.
However, what researchers have been wondering for years: the airlines do not act 100% as expected by the old-earned gravitation law.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The sins are expected to be faster or slower.
So far the physicians could not explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of material through a curvature of the space, may not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken, and attempts to explain the Swing by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made out in the universe.
"Responsible for anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of the dark matter for about ten years.
Apparently, it is an attractive force whose effect can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark matter still represents a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists slaughtered in Egypt are supposed to be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before release, six hostages were supposed to have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Solution negotiations are already to be held.
Germans repeatedly enter the Vision of Kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE paints the most important cases.
The European tourists dragged in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by the Egyptian television, the Arab TV transmitter Al-Arabia and Italian media.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed release as reported by the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking their health condition," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian and her eight Egyptian companions are well-earned and safe, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on the way to Cairo.
Unclearly, the background of a shooting before the release of hostages remains: the kidnappers, according to an Egyptian security officer, had been ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed surprisingly six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German intermediary who delayed the release of the hostages because the killers feared their security.
According to the report, kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe refugee.
The German message in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Abuse of the stepfather "made suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather caused a woman to kill herself, a court was reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had suffered eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly held his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle was killed in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had fed her and connected her eyes before he committed sexual acts, while her mother was gone to work in a guest place.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time officially for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse which had been added to her twice a week.
Advocate Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends would have said that Mrs. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and "abandoned her life"
In April 2007 her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she has killed herself by sticking through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession, which ended: "I used to tie her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't have them sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victim, especially since she was only seven years old.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
The worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the case would be undone before the court if it hadn't done so."
He added: "I notice the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, of her deed over the years on her daughter.
Otherwise, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data are accused of
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June will be charged with the "public security law".
The man was departed from the Defence Ministry when he lost two very confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were delivered to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said that the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that it would interfere internally with the Defence Ministry and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be accused of in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecution recommended that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he transferred contained classified evaluations of Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Apartment building companies see B&B costs in the eye
British apartment building companies could be in the house after saving Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
The interests for this loan will be paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Accommodation Societys (BSA), said that it was "intolerant" that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are exhausted.
However, the interest rates collected in the meantime will be calculated each year to 700 financial companies who accept deposits.
The programme for the compensation of financial services confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that the institutions who have been careful ... are now called to take over some of the costs of the institutions that were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together had to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interests for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies must acquire 81 million pounds for the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Accommodation Societys, informed the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that the institutions who have been careful during the real estate recovery are now called on to carry some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members of potentially considerable costs."
The interest rates that will fall in 2009 will cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will expire for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are both sides of organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or by lower interests on savings accounts.
Milk becomes five pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with paying more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the large market price of his milk by another five pences per litre from Monday.
It is the second price rise this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consultant company have been carried out.
The retailers should decide themselves whether they want to pass the price increase to their customers.
Before the increase in prices in February, the large market price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied
A court in Bangladesh rejected a claim of the former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defendants said that the Court of Auditors refused to have depressed 50 million Taka ($729,700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating accusations for corruption against them.
Scheich Hasina's long-year-old political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of this month against caution.
Sheich Hasina is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-based transitional government first give her unlimited freedom.
The correspondents say that even though their suspendment was granted to go to abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of her release that she will be able to stay on the free foot when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers argue that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Upper Court.
"The upper court has rejected Scheich Hasina's deposit bid because it says that she must not be granted a deposit because she is already on a foreign arrest to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will notify a dispute against the upper court."
Their lawyers claim that they need deposit to return from abroad to the country to prepare themselves for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami Party Chairman on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power, but in June she had been released from prison to go to abroad for medical treatment.
Sheich Hasina, as well as Khaleda Zia, deny all the charges against themselves.
Anxiety about the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
The recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan has not vaccinated nearly 200 000 children because of the violence associated with the Taliban, says the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a UN speaker, this was the case, despite the Taliban's promise, that the thousands of vaccinating employees would not be attacking or obstructed.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB lost his complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing transmitter ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and enabled it to have an unfair influence on the ITV transmitter.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by renamed NTL to Virgin Media successfully preventing the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB would make doubts about the independence of the ITV, which moved the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communication Agency have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share in ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced to want to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. State Attorney affair
The U.S. prosecutor has ordered a special investigator to discuss the termination of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Director-General of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of administrative staff were criticised.
The report expressed criticism to the officials of the Wise House, lawyers and former General State Attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers were discontinued for political reasons.
The expert investigator Nora Dannehy is now supposed to clarify whether the officials who were interrogated during the investigation have lied to the detectives to impair justice.
Serious accusations including criminal practice have not been fully examined or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
One of his main recommendations was the calling of a special investigator with the power to force the Witnesses to say.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice took up nine US prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak labour benefits.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level Republican Congress members, while others refused to examine the accusations of election fraud of democracies.
U.S. prosecutors are instructed to investigate and persecute judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but must not be discontinued for political reasons.
The former Head of the Ministry of Justice Advocate General Alberto Gonzales has been hired for his dismissal and has established his office in the final effect.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also dismissed.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector criticized the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the releases, "resigning" his leadership and "exceptionally interested" in the process.
Other officials, including the former principal consultant of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticised for the lack of cooperation with the researchers.
Meat Loaf's epical song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is intended to be honored during the music prize "Q Award" for his epical hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer who will accept his special golden price next week in London during the loan said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title to Meat Loaf's hitalbum from 1977.
"Coldplay" indicates the nominations for the price award this year after it has come into the closer selection in four categories.
The chief actor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" would certainly be one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song appeared in 1979 as single in the United Kingdom and reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts and sold himself more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. A surgery in 2003 was due to irregular heartbeat after breaking down on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyste on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, lonely, side roads and other roads, some of which are famous and others only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is difficult even for experienced taxi drivers and long-year-old local residents to tell where extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This small street is located in the East Village and walks from the First Street towards the north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks for a dust gas rather than for an active roadway.
There are no street signs, either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard street plan.
Still, this street has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on the First Street.
It wants to replaster Extra Place to create a clean walk to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
One of the other worshipers is the long-year neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short gaze, simply because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and responsible for the road is not interested in obtaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipality this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipality 3.
"Not a very little space has remained in possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers of how to repair and operate the road, what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to it to be guaranteed."
Avalon Bay has announced a few months ago that the small road is replacing and seats that are intended for a café that the company wants to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a speaker from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it does not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this lost gas and make it a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city himself had proposed sales.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Department of Building Protection, said that it was actually the desire of the city to sell the road and stressed the task of the department to develop the real estate rather than to manage.
Compared to his beautiful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has maintained something of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802 when a large farm that Philip Minthorne belonged was divided between its many children and a close strip land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punkrockdenkmal that was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is probably most known as the scenes for the picture on the album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had made the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some inhabitants, including the Blogger, who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged division of the city, which should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremia's disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Claims: An bitter nostalgic view of the extinct city"), published a part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sack gate that remains even dark during the day and is characterized by rustened metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and rainbows flying past weekly newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road looked just so recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back part of the street, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and a empty beer bottle on the ground was not far from a fresh bunch of ranked newspapers.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished something.
Fields, added that he believes that some people underestimate the irritation of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and disgusting.
Debate on two-language training: Education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Eduction Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates for two-language training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in Californian studies and director in the field of educational science at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-writer of the book "Not as good as you think: why the middle class needs a school choice".
To address the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability for African-American and Hispanic students to complete school is lower than for white students" - what is true.
In order to close this range of performance, Obama's education plan recommends, in particular, a two-language transitional phase in training for those who first learn English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his use for the two-language training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance to school services.
Consider the example of "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of the students are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Yet, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students had the state examination in mathematics at a good level.
Similarly, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were well assessed in the English examination.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferable by Obama.
The Sixth Street school focuses on review and exercise, on steadily control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in a English-speaking environment. This is the point Obama should observe, says school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach values the almost exclusive use of the English language in the vocational training course.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of two-speaking training, told me that the school would have a remarkable success with a student who had just just come from Mexico. Twelve months later, one would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The benefits of the school would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national image unifications have long been supporting the idea of two-speaking training) and its own consistent support for the two-speaking training are uncertain about Obama's response.
While he agrees with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should take carefully into account educational models that work instead of despise and trivialize them.
The oil price declines as a result of new fears about the economy
On Monday, the oil price was delighted because of the fear that even the US saving plan for the financial markets could not re-experience the economy.
The raw oil term shops at the New York Trade Stock Exchange fell by 7 per cent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has decreased by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shocked by both the financial turbulencies at Wall Street and by strong spinal storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July reached their climax of $145,29 per barrel, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month to rise again, as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have shown concern again, although convention representatives had announced that they had agreed in the weekend to a salvation plan that should be the largest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far not completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, the Citigroup will buy up the bank transactions of Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the excited negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems not to have been able to experience the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to worsen, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Analytics of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the U.S. virus spreads worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Indoor defense Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he went up more often in the last eight and a half years than anyone else in the Jets tricot.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
After a flashy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to a afternoon when their developing collaboration made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, one time as one outside defendant and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't worked very hard," says Coles about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played catches, the defense took quarterback Kurt Warner apart.
The outside defendant Darrelle Revis took off a defective waste and transformed it into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and took him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most crazy.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets took the ball back and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the insane, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, replied "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On both answers, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reaching one, Mangini said: "Trust me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Extruded Gebrselassia strikes its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think it is the best long-range racer ever after he broke his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person who made the line of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory at the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, thus set up his 26th world record in his diversity career, in which he at least reached a world championship title or a world record on each distance from one kilometer to the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie excluded the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because of fear that the air pollution might worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railway runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have switched to long distances from Kenya, the record time for Marathon has fallen over the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa won from Brazil in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie informed the press that he had had cramps in his wade two weeks ago, so he could not train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after a break and didn't get back in the rust.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"All things went perfectly.
I restarted the training a week ago and had some concerns today, but at the end what's great."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he is excessively orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars generally, too much relying on the race leaders, as if it were a rail race, and setting world records over the competition.
But this criticism is hardly harmful to the size of breasts as a long runner.
Following four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite drivers from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the temporal makers had left behind.
Something more than three miles before finishing, Gebrselassie has made its last access to separate from Kwambai, who arrived as second in 2:05:36 and thus improved its best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became a third in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing with 2:19:19 the seventh fastest result of all times.
The World Record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had won surprisingly the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon for five minutes.
She has planned her course by having rided a quarteret from Ethiopic and Kenyan runners first, but after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop arrived from Kenya as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the passion in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the developments of the recreational parks in the area of Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and giant driving, is a quiet city where pride and complications of African-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first totally black city in the country and the home city of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did it in 1935: "The city with 5 lakes, three crocket spots, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaven, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet it is and remains the city that it describes – and which made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced at the time of the depression by the federal writer project – in many ways a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, digged and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "so little knows about us that he doesn't know what is missing from him."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open discussion about racial relations, many are still suffering to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very focused on how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to an inhabitant of the city and community member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be true."
Eatonville was long defined as a paradox of the triumph and the fight.
It is both a historic example of black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a high-burg of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the Southern rural region, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and watchful.
And so right the concerns about Eatonville's Image actually began with Zora, as all of us call Hurston.
She presented the world her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in Mundart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leader changed the city very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freak as Oskar, both in real life and in literature, led Hurston Reader to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Above the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown -which is stroked modern school, with its well-made gardens and playgrounds to which Howard Miller always cares, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells every kind of drinks and what-soever fits hours rooms."
In only a few hundred words, Hurston therefore linked Eatonville to self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls to the Hurston, quoting the men who sang the songs about their beauty, which were full of sexual plays.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
There is still a reminder of Hurtson as a lively excentrician who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston broke into the city, she usually did this without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and with pants dressed, in a city that today imagines something about her honorable dressing style.
According to Mr Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "She never remained too long," he added while he shaken in his chair, on a backward terrace that looked at the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was likely to be baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were interrupted.
Together with the majority of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary longstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was accompanied in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida.
In Eatonville there was no large Memorial, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they have understood their contribution in the world or her inheritance in the least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-way motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-way headway of the municipality.
Orlando had already pushed the motorway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, including, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred into the Community.
"In this time, a lot of white boys often came and they cast oranges and stuff on the abandoned people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed in it.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955, in a letter to Orlando Sentinel, Hurston asked the Supreme Court to force integration by calling its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council as "political rather than respecting my race".
Today, inhabitants say that although the abolition of racial separation in some respects was positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his youths.
"Black children were used to get embraced - I remember - they embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathhiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business leader of the commonly useful group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be kept upright so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You did not embrace your white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there is a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathhiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who rejected prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went on the way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the re-experience of her glory.
Five years later, a very praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was found in the books and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescuer.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-tracked remote road lived the city, accelerated the entire city with top speed, awakened genuine citizens' pride," said Mrs. Nathhiri.
Mrs Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There came more and more trainees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new one-stage library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly planted and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from the town center of Orlandos, it can sometimes feel like a back gas in the summer rain, as small as it was then founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(She is now 90% black.)
Outstanding in search of Eatonville's history and its significance are still being treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in front and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a wise and representing black men in field work - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time the Hurston Festival became bigger, a higher degree of home pride was also born.
Above all, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all his problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, foolish, and mixed through as any other race and people in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr Franklin's Neffen, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to the college to Eatonville to work in the city administration or at the police who could use some help to him.
And even the disciples, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"The majority of people who go through here will think, "Well, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we talk to a volatile financial latine.
At the first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stands and the huge TV screens at Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shock-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers with the monopolie in New York have the worst day of work every day since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Suppliers still push the metal walls along climbing and transporting tablets that are loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swallows between apartments, as human packed animals load with about 50 hooked T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like stong on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for the citizen climbing food stands on their breakfast bar and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekly day between 16 and 19.
It did not feel like a crisis until Thursday afternoon because of all the world’s underground talks I decided to open a new saving account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on time on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family branch, about 20 people were already in the snake.
Not to the cash switches to pick up or pay money, but to the customer service bar where the customers order checkbooks, tourists to the way to the Macy's purchase house and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "private banking employee with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, where from where they penetrated, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had rejected money from so-called Trykts (a little like a construction parking pool), cooperative banks and local savings boxes, which only have a branch in one State, and said they treat their customers as family.
Last year 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
In the last few days Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy management and as the last Friday New Yorker traveled over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank, who has savings in value of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
In fear of a further crash, the office and shop hires put their bars in front of me into a bank which is considered safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at the Wall Street.
Normally, New Yorkers have suited themselves in the last few weeks.
A woman who was calling in my Chinese tribal supermarket, with so much confidentiality referred to Lehman Brothers, the plunged bank, and their spectacular chairman Dick Full, as if she would blasphem over a faulty colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniform Concierge of my living block, has escaped from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food supply.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going into risks anymore."
Muslim graves disgraced during the right-roasting in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left judge of the Austrian Rights Free Party of Austria, and Philipp Dewinter, member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaams, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 in order to represent the organization of "Stads against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of transport marks on which a mosque is pictured, stroked with a red line.
The police accuse legal extremists of the funeral in a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extremely right parties, of considerable profits in parliamentary elections of the country.
In the night from Friday to tomorrow, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Train at Linz were severely damaged in an organised action, according to the police.
The actors sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials believe that this is an attempt to cover the motive of the extremists driven by hatred on Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the event is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said that they were "in deeply shocked" about the message of the tomb damage that took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan ended.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria after the country went to the right in the parliamentary election yesterday.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the future of Austria, the two far-right-oriented parties received almost 30% of the votes, took place in their electoral campaign for a strict anti-migrant law, and some of their elections were criticised by opponents as foreign enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the voices, took up a ban on head clothes and Burkas and even announced his abstention against foods that were generally linked to Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Brotherhood" to prevent Islam's growth.
Both parties want to forbid the construction of Moscheen and Minaretten with the argument that these political symbols are the continual Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Inquiries and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which indicate that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country are, indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign Travel Block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam Rock Star, who has been condemned by children’s sexual abuse, was judicially forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges placed a six-month barrier to Glitter after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent was granted to hang a foreign travel block last Thursday after presenting evidence of glitter prejudice to the judges for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by the lawyer Corker Binning.
EIn Speaker of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police Kent in Ashford requested permission to prevent abroad travels from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd wasn't personally present."
According to the register for sexual punishment, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He has to notify the police seven days before his planned departure.
The failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison penalty.
The police in Kent said that she would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokesman of Kent's police unit said, "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to prevent any potential risks effectively."
"It is the chief concern of the police in Kent to protect Kent's inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual penalties in the country to minimise any risk that might exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter fled to Bangkok, where he was planning to take a flight to London.
But he said he feels uncomfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through the passport control and he fled for some time to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he would return to Great Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at the terminal 3 in Heathrow and remained there while his lawyer David Corker attended the office court of Uxbridge in West-London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for authorization to require him to register as sexual punishment.
Glitter had been imprisoned for 4 months in the United Kingdom before 1999 because of the possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith was reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no no noises, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the large flamencotants who fail to concentrate and devote to the interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
One Sided Artist
On the other hand, Personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen look or expression strength of hands that are worried because it will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer represents changing theatralics of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was not much known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamencoding at different levels.
The exhibition that belongs to the program of the month of the photography of the Flamenco ` reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which grows increasingly from day to day ', explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any human being, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notices that there are no typical images of artists on the stage.
All normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to pass passionate, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To maintain the personality of these artists, you don't have to take photos on the stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What I was interested in was creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the largest flamencomeisters with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the festival 'Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, pictures developed that remind of classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the image, thus giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that change and is surprised every day'.
This is not only the dance, the song, or the instrumental game in itself, but the personality of the artist, its character, which, with its art, deceives the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of Hiss, was and was the firm goal of this work, which is presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others include the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion to the portraits led him to retake this idea two years ago and to achieve it as 'Portrait of the Veterans of the Sports' ('SportART Project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer gives me much to photograph the people, to get to know them, and to put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult generation.
You meet or hit people, personalities that you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to be able to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos today with the title `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street named la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is "a tollness".
He still does not know where the act of the novel is taking place and what it is about, but, Mario Vargas Llosa is constantly trying to move forward the project at which he is just working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived twenty years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon area.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival of Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel prizemaker admitted that the project he was busy with was 'a toll-courage' and `all suggests that he shouldn't write the novel'.
`If I'd be sensible, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at any time', so he closed his participation in the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days, he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and which most attendants gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and is seen in the theatre of Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience before himself, which noticed that the Peruan, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his call for literature arose from `unusual adventure', from `Freude on reading' and from `more than before'; how he writes and keeps `Disziplin' to supplement `the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appeal and which are the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American Roman writer admitted that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a refugee experience', underlined Vargas Llosa, who claims that it produces 'effects' and 'the people even more distinguish', therefore I asked the writers `sich of ease' and `the responsibility' for his call 'overtake'.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bull fighting feasts were part of it.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bullfight festival with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus the organiser, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to move the bull fighting festival.
Thus, the festival was suspended for the unstanding victory, so two out of three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday it was rainy, so the second tyr fighting feast could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bull fightfarena.
It was just a party on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which had succeeded more by galopping than by his bul fighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fought so badly, a large majority of the audience responded to his second fight with buh ropes.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon, Álava.
Two policemen invited the drivers of the car to stop, where they took the escape.
It looked like she would not have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashic.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A.A.J., as the Interior Ministry of the Basque State informed.
The person arrested was accused of drug trafficking and faking official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Transport Police of the Region of Álava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped a few kilometres on the edge. At the moment the drivers came out of the car to flee over a road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzantza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilos of Haschisch, which was conquered by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hash bandages, which were later guided to accurate laboratory analysis and to weigh the multitude to further police services.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was `doublet', so that it did not agree with the mark specified in the Kfz papers, so there was also a arrest due to fake official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzantza continues the investigations to take the arrest of the second suspect who, as mentioned above, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the consumed drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was brought to a police office for hearing and will be presented to the prisoner in the next hours.
The actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of the Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
One Witness has observed how she tried to ride out of her parking gap in Montecito in a strange way, speakers of the Californian transport police reported to the magazine `People'.
The witness explained detailedly that Locklear `After 16:30 a.m., Gaspedal was pressed and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the parking hole, and when she went backwards, she grabbed herself several times on her sunglasses'.
Something later, the Witness, who at first the actress probably hadn't realized that Locklear was on a nearby road and went out of the car.
The Witness was the person who announced the emergency service because she had "fear for Locklear's life".
When the police came, they found the actress sitting in their car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
'They seemed to be orientalless', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcoholic center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress was shown cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. "The first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine", says the speaker.
Locklear was suspected of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance that could not be determined, arrested and carried into a local investigation at 19 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the Arizona Clinic, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Association will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the United Left and United Left Members, has assured today that the regional association will be for the education of those who will take the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the Council House in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had retired last week after being accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for it', Llamazare pointed out the way the party must have to deal with the one who is sitting in the municipality of Sevilla until now.
Yet, the President of the FL defended the need for 'transparency' in the possible investigations of the rules breach that Silva could have started: 'The FL always insisted on that such cases would receive maximum transparency'.
As regards this topic, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Garci's hero book
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards against the French. This is a fantastic film in filmography, with about 15 million Euro Investment for the touring work.
In this way, the cineast tried to present a lot of personalities and social analysis, which he always admired on the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci today explained at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria at the beginning of a long catalogue of the actors.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in movies and later shown on the telemadrid station as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this work his 'Kindnessstraum' was fulfilled. This was thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him from the autonomous Community of Madrid three years ago to turn a memorial film to the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2, in particular because the history was based on the basis of `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous Community of Madrid for turning work, provides Garci, as he added, the 'on-time possibility' with the help of decorations and similar clothing, the picture of 'confusioned Spain, who chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been represented by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.
However, the cineast regrets the fact that the financing was not expected, as was for `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as for `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the turnbook with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be rotated.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empisar', has contributed by his ordinary working way: he set himself on the stage to the actors with which you must try before you start to turn and for those who had not made casting, he appeared `degrading' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide help in the theater and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he hit in `Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (which he won one) is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor 'Siete mesas de billar francés', nor the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`At the beginning you think you're working for the descendant, later you notice that it's only for the work, and now you're satisfied if you have produced another movie', explains Garci after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamencotänzer from Sevilla worships a dancer also from Sevilla.
Carmen Tortola Valencia: her father was Katalane (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana quarter and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on Oriental dance.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhistine, vegetarian and sat down for the elimination of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón was fascinated by the life of this woman, who left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between wars.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role that seemed impossible to me.'
"We don't try to tell her about her life without keeping her esprit," said the Flamencotian.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, the dance of the butterfly appeared to me like Guajira, or the dance of the serpent' like Tango.
Your dances were senseful and I've been told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The inscension is expected with two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel again at one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco Master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work exceptionally with one of her ex-schoolwomen.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored."
The inscension is also expected with musical composition and the guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actress Juanfra Juarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in which he is always in love.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, who was known in such far-reached places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
`I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain epoch and whose works are no longer known today and that is why they are less appreciated', says Bayón.
The idea will take place today at 20:30 in the theatre of Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia, offers a corresponding atmosphere to perform planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to remember the fiftyth anniversary of the granting of the literary nobel price and the death of the two.
Thus `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, is now reached New York and presented during the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian World Dentist more known.
The United States can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him in `Sensation reporter', and from the dominant idea of the US-American cinema, which was disappeared, came from America to Newman with his exciting idea and followed her.
Now, look what she cost to give him the Oscar.
And when he returned in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Yet, it was a great battle for everyone.
`What a person sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I have lost a big friend', said Robert Redford weeping, 'my life and my country were the biggest drowsinesses of his life.'
No one was afraid not to make himself ridiculous or overdrive.
As a `father' of the cinema and the country of his father, he died in a sad moment in which fear of terrorists and of market breakdown prevailing, in which the depressed self-reservation of the US Americans in the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity is.
If in this hard time, without virtue, only a few people you can admire, you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he qualified a Platonic Ideal of Beauty and Truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses, both profits: from the foundation, which has prescribed to fight against drugs, and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died at overdose, was founded until the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him a lot of effort to deal with a deadly diet culture.
A wide wave of amazement strikes haushoch to take over Hollywood without considering nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize manager, said that the work with Newman was no longer or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the wicked boy who came from Australia, dared to mention Newman as his greatest inspiration.
We have left the largest of all of us', George Clooney confirmed, perhaps one of a few who trusted to live today like Paul Newman: to obtain high demands of justice, to lead a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone who trys, and Paul Newman was an example of it.
He was divorced once and was then fifty years married to Joanne Woodward, who he was faithful, although there certainly were many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street when I have Filet at home?', he frequently joke himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
`From all the major roles he played, he was as proud as those of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the Philanthroph's,' they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some olympic disciplines in Madrid, after failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was called the perfect road, and after my assessment, she was the worst road with everything that was there.
Of course, this is a lot of foolishness if you would be aware of the evaluation and I could check it, would it clearly not be done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The fool starts with the ticket picking that allows you to go as the first.
It does not seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the stomach on the road).
So don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that is to go there only) and (after an infinite queue) there's the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second insane because I need the size of XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it true that after the crisis only small, much cheaper shirts of less material were decided to buy?
All right, things like these are a little compared to the days on the street.
Except that you have to go very early to get the chip, there's already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is unbelievable in the case of a road, where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the street began and we had not left our backpacks before it, even if it had succeeded, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, during these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, it was temptation to organise a people's resurrection and attack the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time in classification because of this chip I have received, I can already think that the output has been misstempled.
Of course, if I was asked for a perfect road, this street would never be in my mind.
So I think we'll dream of a city that's well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which, however, is able to do some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on the campus of the company). The system observes what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people in the room are, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, listen to it, and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also organize the participants after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notes a third person, but she understands that this person is not belonging to the group that leads to her conversation, and that no company employer is either.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will soon listen.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they spoke very surfacely about the change in the strategy of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were equipped with the most needed instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that's only for the few.
Everything is just a discovery when you think that Microsoft added some function in Windows versions and `Extras'.
The change in direction is worth
Microsoft has the right to lose the operating system gradually of importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, this was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
A lot of people showed that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to function at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to informing his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'Death', not as an absolute but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
People give less attention to the operating system every time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to perform the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'window'.
For what is half of existing applications used in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easyer, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can then eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt. I give a little example of it.
The photo of this place I made in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing drinking machine, a sign is mounted: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006 an independent study concluded that 66% of the employees in Microsoft, Google, used to research the network.
Moreover, last week was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Bluth Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well built parish.
When we start counting the countless Stars performances, we can return to the picture of a very powerful man, grab back with a spitting bart that had raised heavy weights in a hiking circuit.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, inferior and silent.
The English speakers call it `tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Brussels exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of his great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name formation is connected with sports and from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' overlays all because of his excellent cotton, because of his distinct unisex cut, and characterizes itself by a small Belgian flag (sometimes it can be recognized) which have these T-shirts as detail on the neck cut.
And pay attention, the Belgian company is not merely focusing on the production of tanks.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmire, Hoses of Cotton, T-shirts with strips, babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it's very bad to use it as a subcloth.
You're very exciting.
"I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate."
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicious, but full of joy.
Currently, the brothers and sisters Gruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
For Mónica this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the Mango company, transferred her residence and also the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsor the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in the dinner for Valentino's honors.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I am fascinated by the film of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'd like to go through a city and watch women dressed how they combine their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I believe, but finally, everything happens in one area, and these areas have many commonities.
Since I was a child, I was enthusiastic about the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to climb around my aunt's garments and see her clothes.
It was great to go nearly better than to go to a recreational park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in lessons and in the samples to look into the mirror and feel well.
As a actress, when you get the costume, you move into the real actress role.
Finally, everything is connected to each other, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionality.
You've recently become 30, you haven't fallen into a crisis?
Oh, something.
I feel better than ever, than I'm thirty years old, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I've done the things I wanted to do since I was a child, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think of becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time I have known that I will be a mother because this requires my body and also I want to be a young mother; I do not want to miss that.
With regard to the candidate, I'm not worried.
I'm going to give my child great feelings of happiness and to train it with much love.
With regard to film art, you keep in mind the work you have participated in and have been rotated last year.
That is the same way, and I very much want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and distressed and wants to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' should be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago you appeared on the walk with Naomi Campbell, right?
I'm fine, don't say something like that.
It's not that I went on the walk to model.
Naomi Campbell, which I have known for some time, has just called and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the welfare event of her organization `Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for Mango were decorated to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things to be told about them, and I, when the one she knows, I would tell you they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing that it is involved in.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do so too.
To support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The car drivers who can be withdrawn due to the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official punishments for the alcohol level, installed in his car this system which forbids him to start the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholized, the car will not jump.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is now part of the report of the Advocate General State, which, according to its information, is a pilot project that will last a year.
The purpose is to resozialize the driver, which is why he receives a course for retraining transport behaviour.
Except for the General State Advocate, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Cars will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30 % and 75 % of the car drivers, who have been shown more than once for the driving under alcoholic influence, have reassigned their taxes.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system associated with the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has made a alcohol test; or if a alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are charged by the one who depends on the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices have been prevented by up to 65% of rules infringements in the first year following its introduction.
In Spain it is expected that 115 lives could be saved annually.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to attack this behavior before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be achieved in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some use vehicles and vehicles of public transport.
The House of Members will be voted tomorrow because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-tos'
With British punctuality, at 17:40 a.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the Presidialhangars of the Benito Juárez de México DF airport landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, traveling with the Prince and Chief of Asturias.
The sun went down, but their radiates have still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal couple that went out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours ago I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so there can be no people at the airport around this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
-Oh, so, very good
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and the prince of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting at the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 soldiers of the Navy, who give off honor salvation.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long hair waved by the wind, without the usual 'peep-tos', perhaps was told her that a thunder is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official order is waiting.
At the door of the hotel in which they are placed, one of the four largest in the city, waits for her a reporter from the Mexican television who likes to joke.
The best premium of fashion
There was probably no more place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significantly excellent fashion designer and Bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a monetary price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first issue, saw her drawings yesterday in the mango branch window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cryed because of the emotional excitement.
Moreover, this is the second largest business in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with the fact that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidency in competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart, which was broken by pain because his brother recently died, cracked together. He dressed the dress from the fashion house and had some jewelry of ELAH that were breathtaking. He kept on the arm of his son Luis, who is nearly two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house of Mango, welcomed the guests and was thus a cavalry, so he ended with the baron of Rotschild without Jacketts, because Jacketts were borrowed to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has hurried to the business and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to dinner she carried a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a stack and made a kind of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the rooms of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always excited a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own beds and towels) in the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without scents.
The stars under the staring sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Rate against Stress
There is no 1000, but one way more to forget the chaotics of our fast everyday life.
And even if there are few, everyone is gathered in a book in which it stands how to get to relax. The book comes into the book stores on September 30th.
The Wacker is a punishment when he rings at 7:00 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the hectic rhythm, which requires the current life.
The office is the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaust and the problems that can be deactivated from the working world.
However, the number increases, not more and not less than 1001.
In addition to yoga statements, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the full list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and thus the rest that gives the book comes into the book stores of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this handbook resists such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenalin no longer rises in your veins to restore the body's balance and stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn the brain off and focus on reading.
Talk in Sleep
Some children speak at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case, you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disturbance called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you were told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month ), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this appearance.
Often, associations with other appearances in sleep are searched, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bednaces at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be very high fever, stress situations or excess.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper, or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the opinion is very intense, it is recommended to monitor the child and to be consulted with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes fear and that is happening in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g., sleep apnoe or stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to raise the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children, which are recommended for relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
When speaking occurs once in sleep, try to keep quiet.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will remember nothing that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears scared after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to be consulted or to find out the reason for the child’s fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so normal), the child is not under pressure to carry out a hearing and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve this because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it is dreaming and why it says that they will be careful with the interpretation of information and the conclusions that you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear the night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That's why you're scared.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that lasts just a few minutes.
Illusions ... finally
After a long thirsty line, Illhouses on the field are finally back on success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played numerous Torchances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this meeting, where the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot almost passed at an angle, Illhouses should easily dominate the game, and it was successively only fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing crew blocked in the field center and left only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with first two torches fought by Riahi and temporarily, and immediately thereafter with the first gate for the Illhouses by Marais, which was exactly right to accept a ball that had been rejected in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the disgusting patron should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, so that his teammates had to continue to play countlessly.
Denmark, however, did not exploit this and did not face a illhaeus elf with major problems that just took a little back in order to defend their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, where the ball went very close to the latte after a big break.
Sarkozy meet angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will still make a descendant in Bretagne.
In view of the decisive attitude of the fishermen blocking access to several British and Norway ports on Monday, the French President decided to enter the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hoped he would come with 'conclusive proposals'.
The President's visit will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee, which was founded by the British fishermen to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of EUR 1,14 per liter.
According to the press speaker of the Elysée Palace of David Martinon, the President will discuss possible solutions with them to help their companies become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of sailors.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with decisiveness.
On Tuesday morning, they led to Morbihan and Calvado's protest march, which caused stash of nearly ten kilometres of length.
The seal port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not cease.
The island of Quiberon was locked.
Already on Monday, the sailors gave expression to their determination by burning tyres and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations were held.
The movement expanded to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Armel Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not drive out, or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the manöver of trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the significant total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the Crisis Committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the debate planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
For example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient, declared that the strike will continue, because the fishermen will not give up at any point and 'will not go to Paris'.
The professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, are currently costing about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 by the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, or Sam Mendes, adopted by the cinematic and engaged actress Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer observes his delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer calculates this year with 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a danger to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, held his delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, confirmed its President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes a lot of the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size of 30 to 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, who was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, considers to spend more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the $85 billion that was proposed to him.
AIG is prepared to control the sale of a large majority of its businesses, beyond their international life insurance and their age care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
No confirmation was achieved at the AIG.
One of the assets of which AIG may be separated is their airplane leasing filial International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in the reassurance transatlantic holdings, as well as its real estate and investment in the private equity, the FT continues.
With regard to this sale, no final decision has been made, the FT continues.
AIG has to operate as soon as possible to pay back the loans over 85 billion, which have granted her the Federal Reserve, even to the risk that the U.S. authorities receive 80% of their capital and lose current shareholders at the same level.
Analysis Historical Paris meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday after the Representative Chamber had rejected Paulson's plan for the salvation of the banks, a historic case of course: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and afternoon 9,14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684,81 points) was recorded earlier on September 17, 2001, the day of the decline in trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final numbers, the afternoon index, mainly technology, was dropped by 199,61 points to 1.983,73, and the widespread index Standard &Poors 500 by 8.81% (106,85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan for the sale of banks by the Chamber of Members, which should allow a little stability on the markets, the Wall Street, which was already invaded at the beginning of the quarter, broke together.
On the other hand, with 228 votes and 205 votes, the Members refused to reject the financial secretary Henry Paulson of the funds he had asked for.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here is a bad picture that represents the Congress as unable to adopt a plan', said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project, adopted in several days, will come too late.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (American Central Bank, Red.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, which would further restrict the credit conditions', Brian Bethune warned, economic director at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized the feeling of extreme urgency even more, `what's the ruin of a financial company in the United States' every day that goes.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the US authorities planned the purchase of the bank transactions of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets do not face only an American but a global crisis, the FTN Financial Analytics added.
The market for basic needs has grown strongly.
Income of the state cash within ten years has decreased from 3.632% on Friday evening to 3.827% and revenues within 30 years yesterday evening from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first TV show
After the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday, another one followed to find out who came out as a victor, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television show, which was to be persecuted by a third of the American families.
The political analytist David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although considerable, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in elections five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a opinion survey was published on Saturday, which Obama has five points ahead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that democracy clearly makes the better figure.
With the still undecisive voters, so the ones to which it is now, Obama came up with 39% as winners from the surveys, while, according to a CBS survey, the winner of McCain is 25% of them.
Obama should be able to confirm his predicament on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rivalin Sarah Palin
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts, but she warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop putting his indisputable experience in the field of foreign policy to the forefront, and clearly underlined the 'Naivity' of his opponent on these issues, which were the focus of this first television show.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...' he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president," he also assured.
An attack point that has been preached in the Republican elections since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being removed.
He emphasized his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image of the world of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood Obama', but this weekend, a democratic voting spot against which the Republican was accused not to have recorded the complete extent of the crisis that is charged on the 'American from the road'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama proclaimed last night 20,000 people who had gathered in flooding rain at a election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words 'Mediterranean' or 'Workers'. 'The financial crisis gives Obama, which the Americans think is most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The next week could be a decisive turning point', appreciated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative of Rahm Emanuel, a former member of Clinton Government, compared the 'good economic instinct' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.
After again stressing that he would even be able to reduce taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the variations at the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are considerately devoting to the questions that were taken to the financial market saving plan over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the convention yesterday evening and is extremely unpopular to the people.
'Have you noticed that a choice took place in Minsk?'
Youths and oppositional demonstrated Sunday evening at the main place of the Belarusian capital in order to reject the results of Parliament's elections in advance.
Some hundred white Russians gathered Sunday evening since closing the elections at the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should withdraw'.
Some admit that they haven't even chosen: 'What's useful if they do with my voice what they want', says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has proved to foreign observers in the best light to reopen negotiations with the European Union is willing to carry out a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-profit of visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the imposing of certain assets, could be repealed if these elections were considered clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded by the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the countdown', regretted Juri Potemkin, the press speaker of the Union of democratic forces, a heterogenic union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasized by Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for presidential elections in 2006 and leaders of the pro-European movement, because it is important for us to count the votes, and this is the executive.
If Members enter the opposition in Parliament, then because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean television broadcasting time, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.'
The opposition is therefore guilty of intervening in the political game, because dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly debted to Russia, leads to a crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe, which has pursued the origin of elections, does not recognise the choice as valid.
It stresses that the election rates appear too high and that the extension of the voting fee in advance (26% of the voters of Minsk) has given the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that a choice has taken place?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition members in Parliament, those who are most conforming to the opinions of the government.'
The silence of the night goes back over the October Square.
In television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - From blood that became safe again
Hemma-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all the reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the confidence of the public, which had been severely shocked by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and the unsatisfaction of the public, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to prepare directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitating to report, several provinces then put a committee on their feet, whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservations in Canada.
In Quebec, the Committee of Gélineau fulfilled this assignment.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up her work, only 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservations and through work in this area during the following years, we have recovered the confidence of the public', before it proudly emphasizes that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, is conscious of the fact that 'trust is something very cruel'.
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the occurrence of numerous cases of human form of bovine wheat in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, this woman, who has been responsible since the start of 1998.
`And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
So we call on one of the main directives of the Crever and Gélineau reports, which, according to exclusion measures, are applied if we do not know this and if a disease progresses slowly, as it is evident in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proved that this disease was transmitted over blood.
Thus this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which enable the donor to demonstrate the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used to date.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million blood preservations should be distributed before a person is identified with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case where HIV was transmitted via a blood conserve.
I believe that today you can feel well when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore health," says the head of the head of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to obtain the safety of our products.
You never know what disease agents can get into the system.
Only last year, on the island of Réunion, the Chikungunya virus appeared, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted via blood by insects.
We need to monitor ', Dr. Décary continues before she stresses that Hema-Quebec also needs to provide adequate supply in addition to safe supply.
`The need increases because the population ages.
Since treatments for cancer control are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which is an average of only 3% of Quebec’s inhabitants suitable for blood donation.
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and who meets the fitness criteria can spend blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
Averagely, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because, for example, they are sick of AIDS or malaria, and who has travelled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from blood donation for a year.
` With these 3% we are able to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network when they get older and no longer can donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to keep them and to make them become regular donors.
Life is so heavily today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour on blood donation', Francine Décary regrets.
With a annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservations but also human tissues, including bone transplants, cardiac folds, eye apples and skin, which are used almost exclusively in case of severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel bloodbank of Quebec.
In the navel snor, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is abundant blood on stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukemia.
` A few weeks ago, we celebrated the storage of our thousandth navel blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand per year.
`We should start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary continues, which describes this program of navel-snurrheaval as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals of Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in semi-final
Montreal's Impact has been held yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-winning (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decides the game of the fourth-final series in the Saputo Stadion, where the total gate ratio was counted, qualifying for the half-final round of the excretion games of the first Liga of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninety-minute game.
After a first half time without a gate for both the one and the other, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other meetings for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who put Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the pre- and return series on Friday Impact the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattles had brought a 2 to 1 downlay.
In the semi-final, Impact will measure with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps moved into the semi-final round with a total port ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are defined today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The number 1-trio of the Canadian crew is ready to attack the season.
Yesterday evening, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn led forward the attack on the Panther from Florida with a stormfire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the Star of Meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolors into six preparation games.
Kovalev achieved the victory by shooting the only gate of all the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel good.
`He set himself too much on it in the first half time, noticed Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a stormy welcome.
Charest places on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude any elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister for Health Yves Bolduc (Linke) attempts to be elected in today's partial election.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of water power plants, mines, Quebec's views were made in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
In contrast with the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he will hold the elections this autumn, even if he made his appointment calendar very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely a 'new economic space' that provides an agreement with France on labour forces, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been often mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th degree - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited itself to explaining why the North is 'a jewel with enormous potential', but no date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the future projects.
At least a few views of what could be done more: especially in the water energy, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of threshold countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr Charest's list, the north has `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area is twice as large as France'' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only in our vicinity, it is in us', he stressed how to demonstrate clearly that he is seeking to achieve a national founder space.
Quebec has grown very much through its connection to the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James-Book.
"It belongs to us, it is our future," he added after he had put in a theatral break to view the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec area, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always invited to, explained to the Prime Minister of the Press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time when the opportunity is offered, I will take this position again on behalf of the government,' he explained.
In addition, 'with climate change we need to rewish our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be transportable throughout the year as a result of the ice melt.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is precisely a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the area, the inhabitants and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal with them very carefully and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (preliminary pekist Member of Ungava) have already initiated discussions in some thirty communities.
A Ministry Committee conducted by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Ground Treasures) takes an important place, took up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, not necessarily a summit, but an opportunity to create a common vision.
The development of the north will remain in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The plan Nord will be discussed, regulated and environmentally worthy, he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as a continuation of the liberal Prime Ministers who were in front of him.
`As the liberals who were in front of us, we have been thinking about transforming the challenges into new growth and development gaps.
This was, by the way, one of the topics that were repeatedly raised in the weekend, which was opened by Jean Lesage on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of party conduct.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading, which has reached the silent revolution and the nationalisation of water electricity, to Bourass, which made the James book, our party always knew to decide the future', Jean Charest explained.
In view of the press, he referred to another conservative project this time, to the `Roads to the North' programme by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
As regards the project Water Power Staudamm Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr Charest stresses the inclusion of the project for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I'm going to be there' he trusted his party members, which provoked in those storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet been able to hold this autumn a choice which is possible from the law.
He stresses that his agenda is full, however, especially because of a mission from the Council of the Community in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided a platform of nationalist plans to the liberal party head, mainly from 'the constitutional objectives' which were adopted without any doubt: the PLQ in particular calls for the recognition of the 'Speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
From the opposition sides, the Guidelines of the Nord Plan were taken with skepticism.
The Chairman of the Party Québécois, Pauline Marois, has reiterated the development policy of the North Du Quebec, which was introduced by the Government of Landry in 2001.
According to you, when the liberal government came to power in 2003, she refused to apply it.
If she had done so, 'we would be much further today', Mrs Marois sentenced on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a plan north by the government.
`But what we want is that this is not just a great idea', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who comes back from the holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' minister (which irony) in Cabinet Harper was the one who allowed her last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a wild fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do this with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, did not go home to their countryman captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things that happened happened to him.
The only government who, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier weigh there under inhuman conditions.
The only one who turns down to a judicial parodie to assess the debt of the accused.
Let us recall that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers are pleading for Omar Khadr to get home for a fair process in Canada.
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before torture: It is little interested that a young adult will certainly be broken forever after so many years of pain.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are now experiencing a ridiculous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper is constantly carrying forward as a flag, and that sounds so nonsense from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen may be mistreated, tortured and locked up, even after the good feelings of a governor who is supported by minority until today (may he belong to the minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation at a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has resolved from what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr Tuws, is in this revelation, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows a orwell logic that the world's largest gold gain society was seeking a blasphemy of over six million against three authors and a small mediumless publishing house with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge about the truth, especially not in the case of accusations, but in the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely disappeared by Mr Garver.
For for Barrick Gold, the best way is to lead a public debate to destroy everyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
Regardless of the process, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against a army of lawyers paid from the nearly unusual bags of the gold mine.
The tactics of these unequal fights are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensus that makes the opposite to death and also disturbs anyone who dare to reconsiderate the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is gang and give in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, debates are usually carried out in Canada by exchange of ideas and not by knüppelhiebe.
It would therefore have been enough if the gold mines had revealed their books and documents and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement side by side.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time and not ignore the opinions of the public?
This word seems to include only the generously paid lawyers in the world of the Vice-President, and not the Community of all Canadians; a very beautifully concealed view of the concept.
In a democracy, even blasphemes have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not want to understand - or not understand - is that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many are observing as a knee complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold just made an claim to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them to no longer use this term...).
In addition to the surreal speech of Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and the finding of truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to investigate and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
The irregular complaint by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what it predicts, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for Wall Street Democrats and Republicans
Bush's administration and the Governing Congress Assembly, Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis, which has been shocking Wall Street for months, has to be adopted by the two convention chambers.
The main content are: better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public funds used, new resources to reduce the number of houses employed on account of payment residues, and the right to monitor the wages paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The U.S. financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber, and the representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, attended yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market', explained the representative of the Administration Bush, Henry Paulson.
The democracy explained that everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at the Wall Street.
`This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, the trauma, the chaos and the disturbances in the daily life of the Americans will be enormous', explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, out of fear of the effect that would have been refraining on the mood of investors.
The date agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only late in negotiations, showed themselves rather than supporters of the agreement, but without fail to express their dissatisfaction with the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain arrangements to the agreement, especially those which would enable owners to keep their homes and those relating to the wages of the leaders of the companies saved by the State.
`If you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the liability of certain persons, this is not what you might congratulate you on.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another channel to vote for the proposed plan, his republic opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to know the details first, but I hope it.
`The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to devour, and with which we will be able to proceed.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,' he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by placing a real estate bubble, which initially led to the breakdown of risky mortgage credits (subprime) before it expanded to other forms of widespread loans (PCAA), and eventually into a freezing of financial power and in the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of republics had failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the democratics have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the companies in distress only are to be secured by the government and not to be purchased, it is believed that the sack gas is escaped.
In order to round the viewpoint for all at the Congress, a provision has also been added that, if the government should lose this programme within five years, it could then raise new taxes to recover its capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can add another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
A further 350 billion payment must be adopted in a new vote by the Congress.
In return to his aid, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him in in the case of profits dividends, and which can sell it again when the storm is overdrawn.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the detention procedures relating to housing bound to the real estate credits affected by this plan and to set the deadlines for repayment and disposal paid to the managers of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Members to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this project yesterday, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
`Geneously Washington does not understand us', explained the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Committee on Finance, his voters.
"Yes, we have a great financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in order to ask the taxpayers to cash.
The democratic Member Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress called the Caucus of Skeptics, represents things differently, but concludes the same.
` Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three nobel prize carriers, have written us to inform us: We ask the convention not to be put under pressure, and carefully consider the way it is going,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we received again evidence in Europe that this is a global crisis.
In an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced GDP Paribas that it would not buy up its competitor, which is in great difficulties since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis due to risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not a loss of money, explained yesterday to the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we receive an electoral right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the sparers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced.
During that time, on the other side of the Ärmelkanal, the British Government was just in order to establish another bank distressed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate credits.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British Government has to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of committed icons
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actress free himself with the charming smiles from the Narcisst mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent must have kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly fearful monsters to the world.
But what a big runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years as a result of the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he was similar to and for which he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his play, with certainly more fragile, but likewise an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should come.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in him a whole country, which was in love with the self-made man, was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, who studied in the early 50's play art in Yale and then visited the actor's studio in New York before he had successful at the theatre, on television and soon in the movie.
Similarly, this man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became the 24-hour race of Man's second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a pre-view relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also the unknown faces of this mysterious, restraining, engaged and over-sensitive star, whose puzzle will never be perfectly solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newmans moved the cinema lovers this weekend into Taumel, while on the dark screen of memories all his big rolls were played.
More than a half century of American film art in constant change moves over with him.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is remembranced, and the young man, who resorts to his senseful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot Blechdach, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter relapse is awakened (1990) that is the case with his sensible Mr Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not all fulfill their promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean after whose death was resumed and made the Newman correctly known in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded in 1973 with the Oskar for the best film.
As a bitter and ravening Billard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
This face through the times, that was he.
He's still.
In his life course, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little Orthodox trainer of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as a pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Contrary to several cinemas who have retired early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, and thereby betray Hollywood, his wealth, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he judged his explicit performance.
The meter was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which the rolls just fled so long.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurorotics, alcoholics, fieslings, or desperate, with whose perfect representation he reflected his deflection and revolt.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true fine sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, marked a fine woman portrait full of melancholic oil.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of fine feeling and sadness.
At the flood of honours that went over Newman ergoss yesterday, his close friend and former army partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely: 'Your presence has improved my life and this country.'
Growth and joy were essential qualities of the dead actress.
In addition to his legendary career, a great defendant of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's deployment, is now going there.
We have often seen him stand with the foot in shells full of vinaigrette, in sauces, bags or other foods, and this seemed quite tasteless, even though we at first thought it was funny.
However, the profits from its turnovers flood into his foundation for children in distress.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a honor to be here."
And for us, it was a honor to be allowed to pursue the life of a so intelligent and generous American actress.
An exemplary citizen, in the nearest and widest sense.
What was produced in the bill factory by additive &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations began in the criminal proceedings against Janos' surplus and his competitors.
In particular, the accused person is charged with the participation in organised crime, as well as gross violent injury and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including document falsification.
According to the public prosecution, the appropriations made by tenders were used for their own purposes, while the benefits provided were often invoked with fake accounts.
State funds and grants from self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are to be partly fed into the fees of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly into the private cash of individuals.
As announced by the detection authorities, in the event of the tendering funds, feasible accounts were submitted, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations either.
According to the prosecution, a large majority of the accounts are supposed to have been faked.
The bill blocks were bought at the market by Jozsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the bills are to be issued was decided on the round trip north of the Plate Sea to which István Lados was sent by János' supplement.
In the course of this exploration tour, Lados should find out pensions and restaurants.
He demanded accounts on consumers to be able to issue accounts later on the basis of these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social and Employment, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These accounts are supposed to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his compliant, András θri, which, according to our information, has been responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the goals of Lados' "Explosion tour" was a beer room.
As two accounts issued by Supplement and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have maintained the ninety-head group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
But now the boss of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another account, issued in the summer of 2002 on the Foundation of Job Jövěért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed serious form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, only three rooms and no more than ten persons at the same time are supposed to have stayed, according to bill 130 guests.
The fantasy of the counterfeiters seemed to have been set no limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in which the accounting documents of the customers Job Jövěért and Hoppá, according to the charge authority, do not appear at all.
According to the editor Gyěz & Farkas of HVg.hu, he was immediately aware that it was fake documents when the prosecutor was presented to him during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were wrongly fitted on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact was also wrong that the operation must have been accommodated a hundred people after having a total of 11 rooms that are impossible to offer so many people space.
It has also been mentioned on the account of eating, while the restaurant has been no longer in operation for a long time.
The official counterfeiters also intended to verify that the Budapest travel agency, which they took in the Vision, offered exclusive travel to abroad, and thus they indicated Hungary railways on the bargaining account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As it was known during the investigations, they also mentioned VAT on accounts, although travel office services referring to a country outside the EU are free of VAT.
The total amount of VAT was on four of the Hotel Révfülauf Kft. to the Foundation of Job Jövěért issued accounts, as the operation is only accounted for 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the staff are also issued exclusive machine bills, but the fake documents were handwritten.
A further mistake undergoing the "calculators" was that in a case of "guard transport" they had indicated the performance provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the prosecutor informed the public prosecutor.
Further form errors - wrong bill format, false stamp - were due to the facts issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Cultureális Egyesület and Biztos Pont as falses.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managers had the power to never have issued the bills.
Another "fault" is undergoing the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was at the time (2001) in a resolution just when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that the bills were not issued itself.
Conscious faked
The other group of accounting providers are persons who have been well aware that they have to lay fictive accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, the Foundation of Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued bills for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért foundation at about 4 million HUF.
According to the prosecution, the manager of the Collab Kft. was convinced by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fictive bills.
The Biogate Kft, which is currently also located in Liquidation, is also supposed to have cooperated with additives and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is supposed to have provided the Job Jövěért Alapítvány, as well as the Association of Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfeny . Egyesület with fake accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was equally little payment traffic, as the bills were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but what the subjects have forgotten in their documents.
The third group of accounting providers shall include persons directly connected with the accused.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian manager of the Delta Trió Kft., an inhabitant of Budapest, but not inventible fuel and vehicle trade company.
This company is supposed to have issued several accounts on the sale of EDA components in the total value of HUF approximately 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the Detection Authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas has been the buyer of these accounts since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romania, which was also to be provided by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has been acknowledged during the investigations, in the name of the GmbH. to the Association of Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and to have issued their counter value itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Ivan Kubatov's express desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, according to the accused of lack of orders.
However, he was able to benefit from the companies: On request of his compliant, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the corporate founding documents, he issued bills on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with award, such as atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov should have issued 15 invoices in the total value of HUF 14,2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecution assumes that Kubatov could have taken 10% of the sum of accounts each and VAT.
Kubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional accounts - in this case, the accounts were attached to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the socialist party's common organisation, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 Forint each, but these amounts have been used in a foreign way.
In order to hide this, they have presented five fictional bills to the TMA of the Works Team Kft.
These invoices were also secured in the search of the Office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused people are now counting with a confession on the method of counterfeiting, as they have already been put before the prosecution.
A sensation could be if the principal accused Jano's suggestion is made to a comprehensive confession.
Because his previous data were less detailed, and even though he had already promised to report extensively about everything, his confession still remains.
The question remains therefore clear whether this is in its interest, whether the socialists have concluded a package with him on the recovery of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether the grant is willing to take on responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the surcharge now plays the "insulted" after his search for mildening the arrest and house arrest on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic injury and have not paid them are on the free foot, or at least under house arrest, are rejected.
The psychology of the survival - or why we are ready to pay more
In the event of increases, buyers tend to spend more and therefore overevaluate the errors.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the Science magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an increase on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even high prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lotto while the others participated in a gambling action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to gain money, but an increased activity of the Stratum, a complex below the brain cord, was measured for losers of the auction, where the surrender of the opponent plays a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "social reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding a overreaction of the Stratum.
In order to support these, the economists in the research group have conducted additional investigations for the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should participate against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, afterwards they made their operations.
Another group was also promised $15 reward for the event that they come out of the game as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the case of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore simply that the emphasis was on the one on the winning, while the other was on the loss.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "contrary to losing" group were prepared to be more effective than those in the control or "winning" group.
"These results can be derived from no previous economic theory.
These have just just justified the ways to be observed in auctions with joy about gaining or avoiding risks.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to the imaginary neurologic process, so we have now a third statement ready" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the University of New York Economic Faculty.
Hepatitis: When to visit your doctor?
Worldwide, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowness are frequent, but the inflammation and the diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the disease, the hepatitis viruses are spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. by contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body liquids (e.g. sperm, discharge or spray).
Travelers are recommended for vaccination against virus A and B, at least there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are shown approximately two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by illness, weakness, abdominal pain and breast-feeding.
After that, the yellowness appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the healing may last for up to two or three weeks.
Over the world, approximately 1 million people die every year on the far more severe diseases caused by hepatitis B such as liver cancer and hepatic cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that only every tenth infected in medicine treatment is estimated.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the infector degrades the liver cells dullly - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who received a blood transfusion before 1991, drug-dependent, and tatovered.
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the home doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
Timely detected, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
On September 30, the world day of hepatitis, 2004, is the first time organised by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen consciousness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious faith seems like a kind of "poor" that is supposed to have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: It has been examined how much faith in God affects the painful feeling of man, reports the British magazine "telegraph".
In the course of the more bizarre investigation, every 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks while studying a painting of God’s mother.
As the results showed, the believers were able to disable most of the pain.
Through a brain scan technology, it even proved that the Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project, in which scientists also participate philosophers and theologians from various university departments.
When attempting, the volunteers were connected to the left hand with a blowing device, which gave the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: for one thing, a picture of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and for the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would cause a kind of religious trance among the believers, while they chose the image of da Vinci because it was hardly different from the other paintings and felt comforting.
The subjects spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and received 20 electrical shocks in four stages during that time, while either the religious, or the other painting should be viewed.
The Catholics reported that when the mother of God saw them, they felt "in security" as if they were "concerned," and they had felt "sustaine and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the attempt, felt that similar effects could also result in similar effects with other, strong-effective images even with the atheists, just to find the appropriate photo.
"We need to find an image that results in very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," says Wright.
According to these outstanding results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna picture Leonardos or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you tell about yourself
During her tenth birthday, Google can claim with fog and right: it is to be found in the pockets of people as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their vacation, which experts they go to and what they move to.
And that's still not enough, says Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managers.
In the direction of skeptics who are plagued by Orwells horror visions, he lets out: these would just overlook the essential of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt recently stated that the main goal of Google was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the original goal of the company, to order "all information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changed work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google could be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really suits me?" but software programs were not able to do so, as they did not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that, during their searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the sites visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and then react to it, so that the meetings can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic, the so-called "recommendations" are based on which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the case of a data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that makes fear exciting, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire to fight the power that many Internet users have to reject.
However, it is proven that the search terms are not only stored, but also transmitted to third parties, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example for this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, while Google provided information collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also allowed to identify the pedophiles.
For personal rights, however, users could still breathe in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organisation EFF, successfully moved against the FBI before the court: so Google can be forced to publish information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of constitution.
(The Federal Government has successfully achieved the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the Youth Protection Act adopted years ago, but it has been maintained the list of individual users, or their Web and Search term list for two months.)
Therefore, Google's Image remains controversial: Those who do not want to publish their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and intimacy by using the Google services, the company is exposed to the injury that is appropriate to the company that represents itself.
However, the American "Geek culture", which is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, see the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, in contrast to Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not demand any identification codes to its users, in contrast with Microsoft, and provides its services freely, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program packaging seem to be far more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the Geek looks through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been focused in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" concerns nothing but collaboration, speaking, users deliberately leave traces and benefit the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can simultaneously manage its profile on several Community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, this can connect to each other by means of other services such as Twitter, or musical services such as last.fm, and can eventually include all this in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleryes that are easted on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: In view of the party photos last night, the girlfriend will soon find out who has enjoyed her unfaithful friend, or the employee will be released because in his blog he is only too honestly making his trouble about corporate management - one is sure: the term "private sfear" has now been completely newly interpreted.
Those who live on-line life are what he offers - in such a way as to form the fundamental idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep something secret, or even to handle the Google monopolie, can like this - such as with Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing Google's search engine, will not deliberately leave any traces behind.
Not a few people willingly register not on Community pages so that they are not found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile by the user.
However, the public opinion waits boundly until Google shows her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising area of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the more and more rapidly introduced services provide not only Microsoft but also other software developers head break.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counterpoles: For example, the group management has completely rejected a protest from the employees after the fees of the company's own children's garden were doubled, and the management also felt that the multi-time care of employees was too expensive. However, all of this is just too mild against the fact that in 2006, before the Chinese government, Google even went into the knee and agreed with an agreement that all regime-critical meetings, or those who stood against the good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal system of the group is that no new service will be acquired in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years may revert somewhat strongly: while some think that Google's book and magazine scans or archives project now assume that the company should soon deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather worried about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already provides the substance - such as "scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellic manner a future in which a man gets terriblely near by Google related data.
Two youths help the double murderer of Ozd to remove tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ozd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected to have helped remove the traces, the speaker of the police Commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were advocated and are currently accused of aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves on a free foot.
Aid is threatened by a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is suspected to have deliberately murdered several people from greed of money.
As part of the investigations, the 23-year-old had declared a greater amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to repay his debts, so he locked his believer to an area in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action of a long hand - this also demonstrates the fact that he committed the murders with a hidden weapon at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the Tatwaffe and the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaws offered stock exchanges for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of Prague stock exchanges.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warschauer Börse, confirmed the offer that the Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchanges.
That's why Warsaw's stock exchange belongs entirely to the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, who, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the next few months.
According to the Czech newspaper "E15", the offering of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
The newspaper reports that until now the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have made offers.
Petr Koblic, Chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the stakeholders the Warsaw Stock Exchange was probably the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closing of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion crowns.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the international financial crisis, some leading European leaves already spoke of the second 11 September on Tuesday.
The global financial disaster, thanks to the American President, said about "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to get his own party for the draft law to one who should bring something to the disturbing situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billions of investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second September 11,".
Parts of the press in Madrid also placed the sinbook in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo", the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the breakdown.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to break together, and below it will suffer the whole world.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the convention, threatens that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy hangs in the air, just at a time when one of the largest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place.
You can no longer take care of the threat, for example, the Geneva means "day indicators".
Although some states could still provide their cash institutions that have been inadequate, rescue packages, and save the banks with the taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are more banks, then no further financial sprays or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over the monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna "The Standard". Furthermore, the newspaper continues to be more realistic, the concerns that, after the Americans, European taxpayers now have to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not seriously disputed about the crisis, which is now as a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "reporters" would not have to "wedge" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to keep in mind in what case it would be reasonable to address taxpayers' money in order to remedy even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to avoid accidents, unless imitating the natural obstacle sensors?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project in which Nissan engineers of Hummeln were inspired to create new accident preventive systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the biomimetic system of type BR23C controlled by authoroboters, a mini car, equipped with the properties of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collision.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protective shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
In order to imitate the function of the composed eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles to the BR23C in a 180 degree face field within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor, which immediately starts the collision prevention process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds, and the authoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manöver takes place instinctively.
"If not, the authorobot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authoroboter project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately as this technology corresponds to the innerst and most vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer that is still considered unavoidable within accidents.
The whole process must reflect the bees' behavior when they differ from other bees.
And this must go in the fraction of a second.
However, the excavation, in contrast to the bees, can not occur up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, just towards the turnability of the tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open to avoid other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotation, acceleration and braking at the autoboter.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less on the processing of data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It must not save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using previous manöver, so that it takes only a handful of KB Memory at the current time.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte hard memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision prevention technology, which will be serially in production within the next ten years, according to the assessment of Nissan.
Another application could find the technology at GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the car driver around obstacles and thus bringing it to the target.
A name for the sinful child
Now, the written version of the 700-Mrd dollars heavy rescue package law, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
At a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight's East Coast, the congress delegates, after several days of debate, went through a consensus on the 700 million dollars heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President of the American House of Members, and said that the agreement should only be written.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said about the result: The programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but you need to do more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the salvation of the Wall Street, but about breaking the rude of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before opening the Asian markets, i.e., the time of Sunday evening at 8 a.m. (Mediterranean Time Monday 2 a.m.), but no height flights on the stock exchanges were launched.
On Monday, the House of Members first votes on the draft legislative draft for the stabilisation of the economy of 2008, then the Senate is on line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme does not refrain from the initial recommendation of Bush administration, in which the $700 billion should be issued at once for the purchase, with credits of securities loaded.
A first tranche is intended to spend a maximum of half of the 700 million dollars, where 250 billion are available immediately after the convention is expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchasing of credit deposits, bad securities, and over the other 100 billion USD is to be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a own Commission which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the convention.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgages charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the undertakings concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the appropriations to be concerned and the companies pay the corresponding fees to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be provided as emergency aid for the American financial system, whether it is available for the large purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger monetary institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, says Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now in charge of state aid can expect their executions, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas snake, to be reduced by the government.
A reduction in wages will only be in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will help each.
The reduction essentially means that when the Ministry buys in the context of an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed unless the hired bank manager is kicked into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of faulty loans, the government will take aggressive action to ensure that the manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes the fact that the existing golden handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in the American history that reductions in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented the democratic Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks, thus decreasing the risk for taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank get better.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years how taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, on both sides there were skeptics who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
This is not what American citizens expect of us, the plan does not at all protect taxpayers' money, says the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were advanced by the same people, which are also responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.

No more visa in the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the US-Hungarian visa agreement to enter into force around the 12th Jens, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Their view is that "all things are still dependent on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced in the overseas timely."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists must register in advance.
The Chief of Hungarian Diplomacy is taking up negotiations in Washington today.
It meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will transfer it to the "Mediterranean Payment Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and also conducts discussions with the foreign political advisors of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support saving packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the large American parties, agreed their support for the 700 billion dollars heavy saving package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and Representatives of the Government, after days of Marathon consultations on Sunday tomorrow, announced that they have reached an agreement on the banking retention package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the uptake of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his predicament thanks to the economic themes, while McCain's High, which gave him the presentation of Vice-Presidency candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was mixed up.
At a election campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the convention will quickly accept the law of the 700 billion dollar heavy package.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that it has supported.
"We have to act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industries, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to mention McCain's economic visions as "obsolated".
In an interview given to the Sender ABC, McCain explained: "We will all have hard to chew on it (...) but nothing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican Senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the executions for top managers - something he had insisted on.
The CBS said to Obama that McCain had not played a definite role in negotiations, while Obama was in contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Members will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Presseschau of the German-speaking room
The right camp is intact, only the choosers were more conscious within the camp - so commented "The mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (Mirror.de)
Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic degradation of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution destroys their fathers."
According to the renowned Politologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over its offices.
The Christian socials have renewed Bayern for decades - now the modern citizens are just turning away from them.
The epoch break is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come, but on Sunday something went to an end, but what was already quite precisely depicted ten years ago: the unambiguous hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty-percent market.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Federal Day elections, so still in the much quoted stoiber era.
The modernisation consistently operated by the CSU in the Federal State has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but they estimated themselves considerably at the rate, but without any effect the secularisation, the result of education, the access of Eastern and North Germans to the prospering regions of Bayern could not remain faithful to the CSU walters.
Modernisation always goes with optional increase, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intakt - only the voters in the camp became more critical and willing.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks the classic citizen groups expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and choosers with awards such as university graduation.
Here the CSU's support decreased to less than 40 percent.
The Presses (diepresse.com)
The conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with who? Party heads retaining in coalition issues", titled articles about the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the OPP.
The OVP prohibits the interference of SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open in all directions for discussions, while the Greens do not yet want to establish a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the party heads were hardly looking into their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the OPP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership, this is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current OVP Chef as a vice-cancer, let Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Mölter-Course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
However, Molterer has carefully responded to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann attempts to interfere with the internal concerns of the OVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Jaroka: The Devil Circle of poverty and Segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has started to be directed by the country of EU Presidency of France.
In her speech addressed to the Plenary, Livia Járóka, Fidesz departee of the European People's Party, notably to the educational segment, since it is one of the most serious infringements of law that occurs to Roma children, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European legal and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the report by the European Parliament's Department of Fidesz, Jaroka has pointed out that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be depressed from the labour market because of its low level of education.
"The majority of the Roma youths do not have middle education, and thanks to poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach a higher education graduation."
In addition, Jaroka stressed that education is a fundamental human rights which would play a key role in implementing other human rights.
Investments in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU Member States.
The Members believe that it is important that this cohesion becomes aware of a widest possible circle - for example Roma and Non-Roma.
For the earlier, a Roma student starts the school, thus increasing his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and by means of income and turnover taxes they contribute to national expenditure.
"As EU citizens, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and victorious lesson must be set up" - says Livia Járóka.
As the Members stated, a common, targeted and negotiated approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the desegregation process in the educational sector and to ensure proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the devil circuit of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully legitimate citizens," Jaróka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the European Year of Equal Opportunities.
CSU: Grace in time
At the end of October, the destiny of the falling Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debt, no heads are sometimes rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the personal debates were declared.
Party head Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this gratitude will be.
The destiny of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17% loss of voice will be decided on the extraordinary party day on the last week of October.
However, the much scolded Duo already made it clear that it doesn't want to stick on her seats.
In this way, they want to resolve the angry group and the party base, which demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayeric Tsunami" in view of the loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. However, one year after the pussy against Stoiber they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the votes.
For 46 years, the CSU was a single governmenter in Bayern, who acquired 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state of the Hungarian economy, but they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the partial internal restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice-President and Federal Agricultural Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploratory team that leads to a possible munch coalition with the liberal FDP, or with the legally-oriented "free voters".
One irony of the fate is that with the list of "Free Electors" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-stives appear first benefited from the Huber-Beckstein Duo, so that the targeted politician would be graceless.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoibers, who have so far moved out of the background, will have an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called on 28 September the "best day of his political career".
On Monday Huber made some toxic comments towards CDU - he believes the CSU would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, has not been put back on the legs with a joint act of power, Merkel cannot become Chancellor after the federal day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who did not think that the terrain loss of the CSU will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin because of its disappointment over the Fiasko.
But what is relative is: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the social democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bayern since 1946.
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no Member of the Opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament has succeeded.
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects law defects in counting the votes.
The OECD, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The Legislature of the 10 million inhabitants of the country has come out for decades without opposition. However, the counterparty gathered under the name "United Democratic Powers" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has seriously hoped that Lukechenko, who, in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, has already renewed its presidential mandate for the fourth time, this time some Members of the opposition in Parliament will "late".
Therefore, the ODS has even taken distance from the previously planned boykottes.
The Ukraine is increasingly dependent on the increase in prices in the import of gas from Russia. For the reduction of price increases, even loans have been received, and the country has also retailed Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading to the country, to the Russians. Thus, in the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope was that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukechenko and other high-level politicians have been prohibited to enter into the EU because of the anti-democracy policy system.
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD's evaluation report, in which the emphasis was rather on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday, which is why oppositions are not supposed to occur in the press, and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the countdown of votes.
Despite all this, opposition can detect a improvement in the political system: political prisoners were approximately free, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing the recognition of the independence of the apostate Georgian provinces of Southern Ossetia and Abchazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, regarded as independent for one month.
"We have made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the Presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty have become afraid to leave only one oppositional in Parliament".
The opposition does not intend to protest against the results, but rather trys to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the oppositional newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way in the distribution of stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkewitsch in announcement that even the most supported layer of pensionists is not agreed with the Lukechenko regime, whose only debt is the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time until the "social security" beginning to break to the silence of a cemetery," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, head of the Community Mission of Independent States, explained the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the acts, and not the words". The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From now the work is frozen"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotable doors for the entrance and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will take effect against those mud eggs, which will only stamp off and then go coffee drinks during the working time.
The new Anti-Faulpelz Act was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Dirable doors are a means to increase working efficiency through a higher rate of presence and more services", says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," stresses Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotable doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, there is no breakfast now during the working time; end with coffee or Croissant.
Brunettas advises this with a smile: "A good cappuccino works miracle at 7 o'clock."
During a meeting of the Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months, the absences of officials have decreased to 50%, that is, 60 000 people more at work per year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy.
"These wage dynamics - so the minister - have been twice the size of the private sector over the last 8-10 years and far above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have been gathered together to counteract the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister for Public Service profiles on less absences at work - as the consumer centre writes - the people of the 'active faulze' are growing uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain war to the unlawful standards of the Decree."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fought for additional financial compensation for work-related disease, and the planned extension of the obligatory house arrest of the sick workers, during which control visits can be made and further aspects of the newness of the Minister.
Napolitano: "Prohibition against accidents is crucial"
Every day there are 2500 work accidents in Italy, three people die and 27 remain invalid for life.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents were at about 1200.
These figures prove the seriousness of a phenomenon, which is almost twice the number of deaths caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will commit the 58th national day to the victims of accidents of work, so that social institutions and media will focus on this dramatic situation.
"The alarming data distributed by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the decisive question of prevention at work.", confirmed by the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of Amil (Associazione national mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expressed its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting injured workers, supporting the victims' families and awareness of public opinion".
"A disturbed "Basta" has risen on this; understandably in tragedys, which, measured by their size, trigger some spines in the media and the public's participation. However, daily reality is often confronted with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case there is also a resource problem: it must be decisively invested in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for direct awareness in the school framework are particularly important since the young people who are feeding the labour world.
It is our duty to focus on this phenomenon and not distract from its social seriousness.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini has stressed "like the phenomenon of work-related deaths a urgent social emergency, which infringes the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on certain rules aimed at bringing an end to the problem".
"The data of work accidents seem to signal a slightly improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high," stresses the President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandeli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you do not really do too little to meet the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against by various actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli, but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting at school".
"An additional effort is necessary - so he adds - as regards communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility from employers to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is asked."
Mercandell also referred to "the progressive worsening of the protection of the accident victims of work" and pronounced the "absence of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give the employee a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident of work will not be dependent on voluntary or random donations decided from time to time by a lawyer."
Mp3-Player under charge: Danger of hearing damage
Sounds of music over a longer period with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission, quoted in a report today in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – as it is said in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who for at least five years longer than an hour a day hear sound music with portable music devices risk the permanent loss of their hearing."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people, who usually put on a high volume of portable music devices and mobile phones, will harm their hearing without knowing it inevitably," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – it is said by the European Union – show a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to make consumers aware and make these information common.
In view of this scientific knowledge, we need to review the existing control systems again so that they can be fully effective and take steps with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical equipment among young people.
"The scientists - thus conclude the EU communication - confirm that you are rightly concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and adolescents better from the noise coming from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European norm at the moment which limits the level of noise of portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from a too large noise load.
These damage can be very restricted in which solutions such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise set are taken.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union points out that if users of portable music devices hear only five hours a week loud (just as 89 decibel) music so that the legal limits already exceeded the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This amounts to 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start shot to the "Commission for the future of the capital"
We start today, it is supposed to be over in March, in June the balance is drawn.
This is the term set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the capital of Rome". This morning the Commission met in the new seat behind the Caracalla therms.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and municipality will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Chief Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it" - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility remains for the city and municipality.
There is no re-distribution of competences, only the will to have a place where you can develop a large project for Rome.
In March its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - so announced by the Chief Mayor - we will present the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the competence of the Commission, because their view of liability is lacking, who answers Alemanno: "All things depends on the work which the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics are dealing with the daily problems and emergencys that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we want to have a longer period in mind to work seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The chief mayor of Rome stresses the importance of clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to think about it. It will look at the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city to make a quality jump - which it really needs - and thus take a common step in the future".
A future, said the chief mayor of Rome, which "will not only limit itself in the current municipal borders but will look much further," not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean Sea."
Obama – the first anti-American President? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much concerned about being regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations with the enemy Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama become increasingly stronger, right now when the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frightened: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation who has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
Actually, however, these attacks do not have much to say; it is racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; everyone says that Obama will win with a great predecess.
Also in this case, people are there who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in her editorial: only in the electoral cabin we will probably know who the real American Patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last time.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our crawl, whether for Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something that was never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these thoughts, the final weapon for the democratics is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a step in the ass.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Yet, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who is going to take his job is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial breaking leaves its traces also with journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the shortages. And many accuse the Internet, the "Morder" of the print press.
500 American journalists were consulted by the PEW Research Center on their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Yet, they did not declare any real concerns to the information concerning advisors because of the general credibility.
You don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists a economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems come through the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from diminishing significantly.
A clear, but complicated pessimism today fulfils the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the print press believe that journalistism is on the wrong way at national level.
In the local field, the Executives are even 65%.
Printed against Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the way the web is going.
The main publisher groups run the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "killer" of the print press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists experience has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they want to join the new technology in the hope that they will bring something good for journalism.
The biggest rise exists in American journalism today between the newsroom managers and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the managers at national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in the work".
The operators who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists have 30%.
The topic of the "safe work" in the team (our "redactors", named Red) is always a recent topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it are the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and television broadcasters and Internet operators, employers offer their popularity and so it becomes a question of taking it or leaving it.
The managers often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes receive only 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance money.
As regards holiday, the matter is complicated: a certain quantity of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they themselves admit, are often "sick" over the year.
It is a question of the climate.
UNIPOL: DIRECTIVE IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Justice in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate maker, which had requested to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola because of bankrot in the context of the investigation on the countercontract in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted to a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the property maker to be moved from the province city to a apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, such transfers (which the prosecutor had stated) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and get to him proof.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago when the Chamber of Members voted against the $700 billion spare package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in rebuilding the Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in progress the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast Sea, always favouring the government institutions and the business community and those neoconservatives who are opposed to "the ones in Washington" and the financial world and, for example, in the south and the centre of the states of voters.
This part of the party is due to its rise in contrast with the voice of which I mentioned above.
However, this example mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that announce the current economic earthquake or even already represent: not only in the United States, also in the West, and perhaps beyond them, will be affected by them.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-frighted events, which finally accept and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unhearted renaissance of the State in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in the banking and financial institutions, which have close relations with abroad and also manage an enormous amount of private households that live in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments, namely how it is to behave with the families concerned, which also represent a huge voter mass.
The crisis, therefore, appears to be a global economic, political, is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been in the absence and has lost its right to speak: the insightful evidence for this has been given by the EU, which, due to its second division, cannot find a common way in various national and international conflicts.
Therefore, everyone now expects to intervene in its own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, distribution of aid funds: since the crisis became more serious, only the United States are in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: there are two conditions which, in certain circumstances, cannot be overregulated, which would not otherwise be able to react to any other international organization or market in a similar way.
The new emphasis put on the state-national element is, by the way, perfectly in line with the increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a closest related sector: the territories.
Paradoxically, it is just now when we were so convinced that we were long into a networked total empire, into a realm of the always differentiated technologies, the immature, that at once we need to discover how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the world, however, are on the top connected to a tightly overwritten piece of earth – one of the territories.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second news, which requires a short deposit.
Whosoever's territory, who's government, who says politics, also says Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge of the need of viewed leaderships, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing leaderships, including those of the economy, which have come up as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, a deep enough and in some sense still worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, an inpatientness, an image of inappropriateness, a feeling of distance that is all addressed to a whole class of managers of the western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large parts of the population is the way that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their ideas, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary is the majority as ever more foreign and superior.
Thus, the demand for Leadership is undergroundly a depletioned but powerful movement of the disposal of the leading class and of the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revoltes" of the voters and in the immediate revolt of the collective conscience of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bayern, over the breakdown of the Labour Party in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy plays a role here).
One gains the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, increasing understanding problems and therefore less representative value of what is happening today in the lower social levels of the West and is still strengthened and driven from the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is certainly not.
The super sticker that lets rise to walls
The forces of gravity thanks to a stick and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, which now seem to be nearly targeted.
With an area of only 2.5 qcm, the researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure called carbon nanor tubes.
"The principle of the sticker can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-ordered tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and sliding paper have shown that the new sticker is ten times stronger than the sustainability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "leave problemlessly removed from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Engineering Sciences of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a premature sticker," adds Liming Dai.
Something about going up like Spiderman on walls? Perhaps already, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within space.
So for the moment the super heroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART of research – including the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of clothing.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a microfibre sticker that is like hair by movement on a surface itself cleansing from the dust and thus always maintains a perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Caution against grape fruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness in the summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, as they can have an extreme impact on the intake of these medicines by the body.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk packed as well as fresh fruit juices in connection with medicines. In the context of the 236th meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he repeatedly alarmed: a glass of apple, orange or grape fruit juice is sufficient to reduce the capability of certain vital medicines so far that they are practically eliminated and thus threatened to the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiac circulation medicines, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS IN FAHR – The same agency of the medicinal product had warned doctors and patients two years ago against the dangers of this mix, and stressed to take care of what is being drinked in connection with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that may inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the Appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Universityà Statale di Milano, said: "These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers, who are trying to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended to always read the package leaflet and, if there are uncertainties, not ask a pharmacist or a doctor,” stresses the expert of the Ansa Agency.
Economic nobel price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and external policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron crash, Krugman claimed that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that was not received a few polemics as an answer and was held to the economer years later, but today proves to be absolutely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared from the public perspective in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi from the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economic of great value", but also a Banaliser with a "very aggressive style that is particularly opposed to the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The date of publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software wins as a free replacement for Microsoft's Office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both in the free and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some news to the audience: next to a revised and now spartanically designed start menu, one of the reasons for guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version, is given.
Further, eight against the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, with new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those who allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which for example facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphical editing modules and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Thus you can also generate "hybrid" PDF files which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format around the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now be processed multiplely by different users, preventing conflicts when changing; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a frabe to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the next few weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
For Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD to your home or office.
However, if cost-freeness can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme into private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the large throw: eventually various public administration and schools have already passed to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is no lack of even a training offer, which means optimal aid for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text generation program; Calc, the table program that aims to push Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to drive databases instead of the more famous access; and last draw, a graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded for 3 million and 600 thousands now.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth drop
It opens up a new Doping Case mi Frame of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian sportsman Bernhard Kohl of Gerolsteiner team, who is the third-classified and winner of the tricot of the best climber.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, which was tested positively on Cera, the epoch of the third generation. This had already happened to the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and to the German Stefan Schumacher.
Analysis from the blood samples of Kohl are among those that have been performed by the Losanna and Chatenay Malabry laboratories in the last few weeks.
If the counter samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The Chief of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest and notified, according to the Associated Press, also the Austrian advisors.
The 26-year-old Austrian went behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the tricot of the best climbing for himself.
THEM INVESTMENT: THE NEW YORK TIMES SIDES: IS ITALIA RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the narrow country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for migrants", which are only taken with contradictions.
Does this from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is the question of the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy and from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered a month ago in Milan after he had stolen a package of cookies.
The case shows what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the largest support of the Lega Nord is to be recorded".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls on further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and to speed up the immigration of illegal immigrants is also mentioned as signs of climate change in Italy.
A movement which also underlines the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rent prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last survey by the Sunia, the Rental Society, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious trains. A lot of students have lost their right to study, since their families are not able to support them in this height" – says the responsible of Sunia, Laura Mariani – "in these cities, the great demand of students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized under rents.
For the Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures that lead to lower rent prices by reviewing taxation.
A closer review of the investigation shows that there is a need for a sleeping area in Milan in the district of Brianza approximately 450 Euro; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the quarter band of Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or up to 900 euros in Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping area costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room of 700.
In Bologna, where students are focusing in the quarters around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping area of nuts, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices are located in the quarters around the uni at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bedroom in a double room.
The rentals in the fourths around the other universities of Rome are only less deeper: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecità.
Only those who escape in external districts can save money: EUR 300 for a bedroom and EUR 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need EUR 300-450 for a sleeping area, for a room, the price is between EUR 400 and 600 in the expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping area costs 250-350 euros, one single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to foreign European students is more frequent, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is about 25-30% above the average is required by foreign students.
Bye-bye to the old cinema Paradise – the cities close their historical cinema halls
The historical cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas are a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of the director Giuseppe Tornators describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centres of Italy and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-sale complex in the periphery, in the long term means death for the single cino in the centre. A process that appears not only inevitable and irreversible but also carrys the moves of cultural crime.
Most of the historical places are concerned with memories, "it's like losing a friend with which you have left a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It's the story of a suburban kinos and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well lost kinowel.
The numbers that the Anec, the central trade association, delivered, speak a clear language: over the last five years, the immense amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these cinemas have largely paid the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardey with 41.
This shows that the main guilts are the multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas have been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardei lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also occur, but the first is the reception of the already existing, because closes a hall in the city, not all of its ancestor customers are ready to visit an old multiex kino in the periphery instead.
And there is still a lack of budget for the Fund of the Commerce Association: the debt burden recorded by the State is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame of the ethical-smoral position that the government does not observe existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be needed in the year."
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which has decided to protect them through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec because of the fears of the old cinemas; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historic centre and in the periphery.
The predicted measures include tax advantages for the cinema operators and benefits for the public on transport: it will be allowed to travel into the transport restricted areas of the centre and to park more favourable parking fees.
"It is a pleasant initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
Of course, we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to deal with the superpower of the Multiex Halls, because eventually the audience is more demanding today.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important to me: the closing of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to founding the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass over at the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn side by side to avoid seeing the dust covered platelets.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' leads to the arrest of the Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The Mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia Group of Piromalli.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia Advocate of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his alternate representative Rosario Schiavone of Gioia Tauro municipality, arrested this morning for development in Mafia businesses, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the Clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer who is carrying the same name as the boss of the Clan, had already been sentenced for development in criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm is disregarding," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations have decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consultative activities."
"So the Mafia Group – the judges – had been able to intervene officially in the council houses and to take part in the policy of public administration."
The President of the Regional Committee on Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to meet links from local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of Mafia is greater than in others in which such relations are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta': heroes who get a white West."
The arrests of this morning follow the last July, with which the police of the Clan Piromalli were exposed.
Since the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipality had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – as well as in the event of the relationship between organised crime and local administration – the local politicians had been removed.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then Citizen of the Udc, has been elected as head of the Middle Law Coalition after the selection of May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the resolve of the municipality.
He was interested in the Vice-President Marco Minniti, who he accused to have invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with this morning's arrest order that the Piromalli-Clan had even waived to request an amendment to the A3 project.
From an interrogation action related to the investigations on the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli, has proved to be the same as the interests of this clan."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It is a non-degrading source of money that covers more than 70% of the planet’s surface and only now seems to understand the world’s large energy companies.
Waves, flows and times are the new renewable energy sources that are now looking for all, and also seeking to occupate, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not randomly intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil broke up by 1980, the idea of sea energy is being spent, but now the environmental organisations and the increased oil price are pressing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be satisfied by the energy produced by the ocean waves.
This would be the same as the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and times would still come.
Giants at the attack.
The first company that now sets on maritime energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that are putting on maritime energy gain.
"Ceverron examines these technologies," says the speaker of a company known by the American Giant in the Wall Street Journal, and weighs the possibility of cooperating with us."
This is about the acquisition of an authorisation by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project outside the coast of Alaska.
This is an unpredictable sign, e.g. when one thinks that in Alaska, oil is continued to be promoted by the United States and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, the companies are also Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who invest in the new industry; even if the details are not known, observers are talking of an increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in breakdown, not least because the last doubts of environmental protectionists have not yet been clarified.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are rather smaller and do not seem to cause serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are various possibilities: Ocean Power approximately uses a system of connected boys.
The shoe of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimming pool.
This is driving a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent through subwater pipes to the coast.
So far, there are four plans of this kind, which are only waiting for state authorisation, and part of the energy gained could also serve for military institutions.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a shopping house and a parking lot using underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the times drive the turbines that eat the generator through the resulting rotation.
According to Verdant, a long snake of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the times.
A special interest, according to the Institute for Electricity Research, instantly deserves the potential that is in the times.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, sunshine and also the waves, and therefore a more reliable electricity source.
It is precisely the energy of time which states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have already invested 7,5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
