The product has cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Großkunde, so it's not a problem for me.
Need just a number or instruction what I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a retour.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today she costs 179€.
I honestly think that is very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re order for the better price or is there another way of credit?
In principle, I also believe that children should not be able to take over a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I think it's also good for great brothers to take care of the little ones in a measure.
Let's see a little, let's just help, bring the bottle, etc.
Thus they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can be enough child, I can see no problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You'll best measure if this suits your children.
It's not that he's supposed to wear K2 and accompany him for hours in sleep.
Just legally, it is probably questionable.
So perhaps the statement of psychologists also comes.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter, of course your estimate ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a criminal / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire action, but I don't want the title partout to fall in here maybe somebody knows...
The story was of fear and therapy.
At the beginning of history, an animal career commits suicide by raising himself with feed and going to his robbery cats.
The case is taken over by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation of his therapists, operates a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a little none who also has a fear (fore fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who will be assigned anonymously before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the Internet.
In any case, this therapist ultimately operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that suppresses an alarm center in the brain and ultimately poses their fear in the extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with intention of death)
This is being scared in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone, or even someone could tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password for Wlan available.
You need to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to do after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference rejected ?
Child, 4 J., Splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has all length of wood fragments under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pinzette.
Very hard to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow it's going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
With the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a ladder plate, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be built in almost any hole of track range H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all the usual interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "socker basket" loudspeaker just sound capsule set.
Like all family members, LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 driving levels are as obvious as two- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders fully log in to an appropriate digital center.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values can be read out on the main surface with appropriate centrals.
For centrals that can only programme the CVs of 1-255 exist help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving levels at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses allow the launch of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honourable Control Unit 6021.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote refreshing vaccination
Always bring new Omikron cases to policy and science in the UK.
Thus, until the new year, all qualified adults in England are to receive an vaccination offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress even faster at the Corona refreshing vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than so far sought.
Every adult in England was to be given the opportunity to receive a Booster dose until the end of the year, provided that the second vaccination has passed at least three months, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a previously recorded video message to his countrymen.
The target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one is faced with an emergency, which is why vaccination needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's get upset!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in UK, with a total of 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price at recovery?
I am for all to present themselves with pronomies
I sent a application.
Today, the invitation came to a conversation by email.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him, and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and will not keep an officer over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should present himself with pronomies.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them.
Only the one I bought today can't go
Apparently, the chair had an unseen deficiency in sales.
How can such a polster damage occur after 9 months otherwise ?
Only try on #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since about.
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I always bought the last books over the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to the order and take that into account to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content warning: I'll write some detail here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) get more frequently in contact with the victims (and transgressors) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really nights at me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims are not being helped or we think we can't help them.
I realize that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the transgressor far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear of fear of revenge to leave the usual social environment, fear of removing the children from this.
Whatever I want to make everyone clear is partly very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do about "League of Legends"?

Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei der Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster John Patrick was trusted.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said, with a look back at the Pokal degradation early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, "We have some anger in the abdomen".
She did not lie down after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) downlay in the basketball liga.
In which more than the naked result disappointed the way of appearance.
Deputy is called a statistics that expresses the entire dilemma: The threeer quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (total of young John Patrick) in sage and write 31 attempts - still questions?
The answer delivered John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
He reacted differently to Sebastian Glim: "A gigantic game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were authorised in Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, which marked 22 points and lenched the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," still praised Glim.
While in Patrick's team themselves the performance carriers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debakel and reached up to eight points after they had already retired 39:59.
Besides John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate is not left.
Already on Wednesday (19pm) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 viewers.
We had another mail address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've already reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been informing ourselves legally again and we have written them again for that reason.
We initially reported ourselves a half year ago.
Always like peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to enthusiastic his audience with new interpretations of battles from the 20s and 30s.
At present he is on the way with the program "Good Day, dear luck" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing to do with it.
The planned concert has been moved in May 2022 - "on authority instructions" to reduce the Corona virus.
Other of the events planned during the Advent time must only be found on the website of the singer, who becomes today 59, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then pick up their dates already placed in 2020 due to the pandemy.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and a pleasure as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the palace orchestra together with the Commilitons.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its stock from camps and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded with prices.
His live album from the "MTV unplugged" series (2019) reached - just as his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - the second place of charts.
He made it from the nisch in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, strictly retarded the blonde hair and looking for labels, Max Raabe is no longer thinking away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, dear luck" he has been on Tour. dpa since 2020

Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: Exception does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the dispensation of large residential groups, as was demanded in a national decision in Berlin.
"With an exception there is no new apartment, it only changes the owner structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give renters security that their rent will remain payable in the next few years.
A bright mix from for example private tenants, cooperatives or apartment companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopolie formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Green and Left Party wants to use an expert commission to deal with the result of the national decision.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude conversations with the FDP in the ampel coalition on further reinforcements in the rent law.
The coalition contract provides a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of lease increases in tensioned housing markets and the extension of the lease level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rent market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days, I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been pulled through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky could have more than 100 deaths to complain.
The pictures from there remind you of a war area.
In the night on Saturday, in the United States, several tornados have caused severe destruction and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320 km long snow of destruction, especially in the member state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit in the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was broken, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial installations, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths alone in the member state of Kentucky, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is it still produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is there the possibility of ordering these vitrines in another country?
until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the ceiling now and deliver to Germany that is in the cart?
I had returned an article through the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, since I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising words
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination, companies in Austria have taken the initiative itself and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logans to vaccinate, as a German example, is also intended to increase the willingness to vaccinate Corona.
He changed to a company he laughed about.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year ago.
He obviously did not get stuck at his old place, and he was looking for something else.
You can do that.
And that he didn't like you at that time, no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'll take a screen shot.

Assistance with the first own campaign
Boron to the grass!
I'm just leading the adventure on the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends, and I want to lead my heroes to a specially written campaign for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The large arch is made, the evilweights and their motivations written, the individual file designed and now I am in writing the entrance adventure and already polishing at the first encounter about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a carrier with cereals of cereals to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
It is intended to develop the further action.
Some miles away from the village, the heroes are supposed to lean up a group of goblins and lock them into a restraint.
I would like to give the player character the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convince, act, threats, know the danger early, whatever the players do.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and sails
In the absence of note, the goblins lie the heroes up in a holeway and flank to every three left and right mine bows arm the drive, while two with spears stop the drive.
If it comes to fight and the heroes are understood, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are found and healed by the son of the village school, a half elf.
The car is gone, of course.
2. Should a defeat be indefinitely indefinite, just this half-five will take in with two of his servants and come to the hero to help.
The car is still here, everything is great.
How appropriate do you hold Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entrance to adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narration.
I built the lamp again.
And back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then let the backlights come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I am generated by Sky Sport F1
Hi, dear F1 fans, over the season the quality of the German sky has increased, so I want to take a little air with this post.
First once today in the middle of the F2 race, the transfer was cancelled in order to start the F1 pre-refund in time.
Although the delayed start and the start accident were far behind the planning, one could still have shown the last 10 minutes (planned) as well as the mastership decision (!).
But it seems that, for legal reasons, the F1 will have to take priority and therefore have to limit everything else, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially as Sky UK has transferred the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Blackyes has well accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 once again, the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher did not know that under a red flag you could switch the tyres.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that steps were allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio speeches on this topic to Hamilton.
With Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that it was possible for stepping.
I believe that such elementary rules should be easily known if you comment on the F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate that is now possible or required by rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally not liked with the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that the taste is a matter of taste.
But there I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
This includes constant algorithms that make both simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (as well as unaware) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of disturbance into the comment that he does not seem to take it seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, where Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into the advertising, how to listen to F1TV, because only the German sound track has to come out without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two channels in the training also make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free-TV broadcaster.
Though you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1 program is also very narrow and full of repetitions.
All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transfers the F1.
Unironic makes RTL a better job until advertising at the four races they may still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG#-pendellight, measuring and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Lift pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium additionally with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services compared.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants.
If you have a large aquarium, you can fit pumps with two or more outputs so that you can connect more flowers.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, depending on the model fan pump, but also offers to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air cover (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubble into a function.
Here would be a treasure, a mushroom or something like that.
The MK series has a special, scratched design and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The ventilator pump is connected to an auströmer 4/6 mm by means of an air hose, etc....and it can go.
The ventilator pump should be equal, or higher than the water level, and should be fitted outside.
If the ventilator pump is sitting deeper than the water level, you should put a relapse valve between it.
Cut the air hose and put the valve between it.
This would prevent if once water would run backwards that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the air pump is fitted out, you should be covered and protected from moisture, as other air pumps do.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that use little energy
Even if we here in ebay indicate the processing time of 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also downloaded daily here.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one's conscious, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the supply... naturally here does not stop Corona.
Please do not rate as badly just because the delivery is delaying, which is exclusively on the package services.
Of course, you like to scream about these services, even if we're saying at the moment, they have it fucking hard
This is also very different regionally.
Be no evil, stay healthy, and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without arms?
Can you order your legs in bright here too?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughters and moderns to the world room
The daughter of the first U.S. American in All, a TV-moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Bezos took the freshly crushed astronauts at his reception under the bright blue sky.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronauts, fled Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the Raketing System of Blue Origin was named, and the 50-year-old TV-moderator Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company who had paid other four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology business Lane Bess and its son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin didn't inform.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his actions and do everything himself.
She was just so flirted, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also enthusiastic.
He would like to return to the All once again, said the moderner.
"New Shepard" flys up to 100 km height
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket reached a height of about 100 kilometres across the earth, sometimes with gravitylessness before the re-useable object landed back from large fallscreens.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometres above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third crewed all-excursion from Blue Origin: At the first time in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second time in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actress William Shatner, who was known with his role as "captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshouses, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice-president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critists propose Bezos and Blue Origin to advance the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests to the welfare of mankind and without consideration for the climate.

Someone who works in the biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and actually find the profession quite exciting and even in the laboratory is not disturbing me (has already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
I have, of course, already informed myself about professional prospects before studying, but I still thought at the time that I would surely want to study and become until promotion.
But now I have doubts, particularly depressing the prospects of employment.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear always super occupational opportunities and the profession is totally searched, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and unbelievably poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/communications?
3) What have you studied and what training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really uncertain at the moment, and I think that in 2022, I may stop studying and make a training a professional informant.
If you have experience there they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why you're not gonna have a patch for that.
Not only before large holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there's the one before holidays plus bridge days.
Because it was so: last week Mariä was the sky ride, which we called in Switzerland "Revelation".
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day that is half-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails, which must have been out before rise, order here there, everything *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... yes?
Because next week after so much time sounds and that can't be?
Or because people all seriously want to do as much in a short week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerful.
What is this self-inhalation for holidays?
What, then, are we still having holidays if we are not allowed to make it a good deal?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independently on it.
My question is simple, are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelic kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in their thüring home - but has no presents yet.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by backing with her son's place and baying.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the heartfelt days, she has a lot to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to end now."

Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately still not working
DDR manufacturing model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, which is most likely a rare locomotive from the design of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and errors see photos, function good, The construction series E 95 is a heavy goods-drag electrocomotives of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), which have been designed for the trip of heavy coal trains in the Schlesian network, perhaps also originated by the small series company ZSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Sale) and we are operational
The German Reichsbahn Society had in 1924 instructed the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2 200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, the DRG decided in March 1926 on delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens sheets with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives received operating numbers E 95 01-06 were delivered.
Everyone survived the Second World War and then found themselves again in the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came into the Soviet Union as a repair tool.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
Theseu was found in the Richbahnenverbessering work the reliability of all six Lokomotives.
[4] As progressive reelectrification of the medium-German network showed an increasing need for locomotives for the heavy freight service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were worked in 1959 and the rest of the machines served as a spare part donor.
First, the larger numbers E04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred.
Only when E 94 saw that the upgrading number could not be further increased, the E 95 swoop to the point of view of the upgrading.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at Halle P.
They were used in their own circulation plan mostly before coal trains from the hostage valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complex control of the locomotives proved.
Thus it was often happening that a shooter remained sticking in circuit operations.
Then the continuing fellowman on this locomotive had to resolve the shooter during the ride with hammer and wooden reef.
Injury to the driving engines occurred more often and led to monthly failures at the locomotive.
[5] Since in the late 1960s there were enough new building locomotives and there was no significant extension of the electrical operation at that time, the railway on old locomotives and most splitting holes could be abandoned, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupie electrolokomotives only a few more, which, due to the difficulties mentioned above with the machines and the visional conditions of the leadership would have caused a problem in the train operation.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were released in mid-1969, the E 95 01, which ended the service on 5 October 1970, followed them.
Thus, the proposed new name 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were broken.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at the main station Halle.
It took some time to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was retainable as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external design of the locomotives began to present them to a vehicle view in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has been part of Dresden Transport Museum as a unoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotives took place.
In the DB Museum Hall (Sale) the Lokomotive Museum is held.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P Traditional Society have been working on the operational construction of the Lokomotives.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive was able to be presented for the first time for an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external lacquering, whereas the transformers were checked and five drivers are operational.
-The locomotives were in operation until 1945 on the Schlesian mountain railway and the diverging sideways, where they proved to be due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were transferred to Leipzig to the Middle German network.
The main operation area was Slesia first
Hand-working model H0 in OVP, function well, it is optical rework at the Lok in own work necessary, dustified, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare hand-working model, very small edition- possibly the building set also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage traces.
Yes the F parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some.
The middle bar is held by two feet.. sadly these are too smal and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately they are malformed.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'll be sent new.
When are they sent off?
No, no, no, no.
That's, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfil their purpose
They're not flat with me
Can I get this sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
House fire with two light injured and high damage
Two people have been easily injured in a fire in a house in Upper Bayer.
In addition, a estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has been caused, as the police informed on Sunday.
The fire was probably spread from a carport to the nearby residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
Two inhabitants were brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of deliberate fireworks.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes a lot later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs
To defend Fake-News - Biontech-CEO published Impact Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" at the beginning of 2021
Biontech-Chef Uğur Şahin had not yet expressed public opinion on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
The disease of a friend moved him to do so, told ʼahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, have published a photo showing how to get an vaccination against the Corona virus.
In the social media there was wrong information that I was supposed to be not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a contribution in the LinkedIn network.
"For a few months, friends force me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far he has rejected this because communication should not turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respiratory device for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most frequent cause, however, seems to be fearful, which is frequently worried by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experience.
On the Internet, an interview with the German wave, where Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German Wave himself explained.
"I am not allowed to get the vaccine itself at the time by law," said ʼahin at that time.
There is a priority in Germany for the vaccination of the vacancy.
Now the priorization has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech chef has been vaccinated three times according to suitable information.
Fire in surrounding system: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had laminated a space station.
After a fire with severe damage in a surrounding station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine victory circuit in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to get out for about 24 hours without electricity.
On Friday evening, the fire made the lights for 41,000 inhabitants and inhabitants concerned in several communities.
The carrier Westnet reported that on Saturday numerous emergency aggregates were in operation until the massive disturbance could eventually be completely remedied at the late evening.
Firemen and assistants and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care sites at schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The provider thanked the subjects for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the concerned municipalities, the circle, the fire forces and the THW for the impatient operation," said the Head of Primary Technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet monteurs were only able to restart some lines provisionally at first, he explained.
A technical deficit led to the fire according to company data.
Power flows again
The fire broken out on Friday at 7:15 p.m., according to the Westnet data in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid restraint station, has severely damaged parts of the 10,000 volt shell system.
There is a need for urgent cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is resurrected.
Since Saturday 18 p.m., more than 21,000 people had had power in Much and Ruppichteroth again.
Further 20,000 inhabitants of Ninekirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the last electricity affected by the deficit has also been available.
More than 80 western network and partner companies had been in use.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance.
"Now it is important for the citizens to take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and to communicate to local firearm facilities when needed", said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The inhabitants of Oldenheimen were focused in the establishment and operation of emergency aggregates.
Furthermore, according to state data, temporary care facilities were established in schools for those who were unable to care for themselves or need the power-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them with you and pay in euro?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount that subscription on the table plate.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are three of them.
We wanted those with table plate diameters of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't interfere with them and thus shorten them.
Can you continue to help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a return
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Send me the backmail by email?
the repair is now finished.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do that now?
I find such a low credit almost uncomfortable.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combining Ribs wins
The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are printed on the pod at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.

Recovery of the contract number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we both made new s and use the version 4.5...
may be yes that they have heard of problems more often
Did directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, ups!
This document could not be opened.
The file may be malformed and they may report to the customer service.
As far as I can detect it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work through it!
In order to make the colour job even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, cushion and dry them with clear water.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to the stroke.
Easy overlapping of the colour layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid swimming quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden town.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could shine later.
Metal tones and metallic colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can be uncouraging metal slides when they mix themselves with normal colours.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Original appearance reaches the models through the decals or deductive images.
The decals give the model the last sleeve.
Bring the decals in the right order as long as the components are still good to reach.
A airplane cockpit can be pinned or easier before it is built in the crumb.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, pinsets and dentists, are tired time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each necessary decal out individually and put it right to you.
Decals are also called water sheet images because you whisper their backside shortly with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the nose.
Then you move the picture just a little piece of paper and put the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also moisted before).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper off side.
Attention: Always check if the image is right before you move it completely from the paper, so that it doesn't stick on the finger, knitt or scratch.
Swallow oversized water with a household cloth.
Caution not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look for something else, then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
And yet thank you very much!
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get that back without any problem?
Children's wish treatment at PKV / What's an "insurance case"?
Hello, together.
We were in children's wish treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the car, it suddenly turns across.
The following row:
We had applied for the child’s wish facility in front of the car and received the commitment over 3 trials.
The experiments were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first trial led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the car.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out two (effectless) attempts, but they were not expected with the car.
We applied for the recovery of costs in the PKV again and received three further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have done more attempts than we have promised, logically, the most expensive with the car) we reached the bills at the car and received the evil surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV wants to refund only 3 trials.
The reason: With the pregnancy/born, the remaining 2 trials of the first commitment are expired.
The second wish for children is a new insurance case.
However, according to Terms and Conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment of healing, it ends when the need for treatment is no longer available."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to reimburse the car (only 3 trials) or we (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Would the PKV have had to point us into the commitments that the further attempts would fall out with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed egg leaders) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please let me get the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back to the best
All right.
We're not gonna order any more with them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They'll be happy to forward this to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was caused and now tell me I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything because the commode is completely disturbed with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
There is clear and clear that the refund has been caused and I have still not received a refund by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they've lost two ancestors now.
My friend also ordered various furniture on his account for our apartment.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as a office chair.
Independently, the guarantee of 24 months shall apply.
No, it is not possible for me to create another type of packaging.
I'm going to cut off the cabinet and I'm able to make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional hockers, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What is precisely a Low-Budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find abundant lists of low-budget films, such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's upset with it?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus connected with high costs for the EU
The EU can, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, declare a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This weakness - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Cooperation with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
It appears that there is a "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not refrain from turning towards it, this would be at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems not to be able to continue if a Member State is in the head to make its thing," as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU Frontex frontier protection agency to access the border.
In addition, the EU pays for its policy at the border with Belarus a further price, Bossong said: a principle agreement on asylum policy would be difficult, since the line "green protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Retry of cross-border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have again tried to get across Belarus in the Polish area.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday in the night and brought back to the border, said a spokesman of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been hosted with stones in the event near Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was faced and had to be cared medically by a military doctor.
Overall, border protection recorded 52 crossings attempted within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border blocks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or have tried it.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukaschenko to be the captain of Minsk to have attracted it with the prospect of entry into the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have concluded press reports according to border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the country of origin in order to interrupt departure there.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scale and proved its determination to operate with hard bandays and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also needs to take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not opposed to the regular locking of the security device thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests by controversial formula-1-final
Max Verstap is supposed to have committed two line breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Based on the controversial formula 1-final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes objected.
The silver pills suspect two line breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a suspected violation of Max Verstappen in Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he is supposed to have repeated regularly.
A second objection was made against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not consistent with the rules.
On the last round, Lewis Hamilton had been overturned in Mercedes and had become his first formal 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch cars had been overtaken before him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report again to you
Thanks for support

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemit.
It's like if a dedler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Their i will not admit it both.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distant, you should just let it be complete.
Yes, then, you're just as little serious as Mr. Kollegah.
Who is seriously questioning evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has started all this.
But as soon as you're creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science just lost the fool.
And that's what you're a scientist and not to take serious like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimum view field, the magnitude should be closer to the eye as close as possible.
The special aplanatic-chromatically designed lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone without any colour.
Lups are often marked with enlargement data.
However, these information shall only apply to precise conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to use your magnitude optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical appliances - also in the case of lups - light reflexes occur.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflected layer.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceived.
Further information is available in the instructions for use (in German and English).

Tooth sale in Beauty: In the municipality of Crembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced such curiosity during the sale of tons.
Once a man was supposed to have gone home without his partner, because both couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants for this good 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a curiosis situation.
That always make the pre-Christmas a little funny, he says.
What about the goods?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate that accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between them.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "Dreher", which is far from sounding so delicious.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new glass fibre connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network now.
Before I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit correctly up to a few failures.
The new glass fibre connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wi-Fi no longer reaches the full 500, but the more I get away from the house with the module, the less it comes (also use a dosing that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This causes the Internet with the new fiber connection now at the first floor even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similar large losses here too.
Can anyone explain to me why with glass fibres so much Internet speed is going through the power transmission "missing"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to move in the house LAN cable still.
I'm really desperate, why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought that now was the first rest with the giro accounts, looks deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to be confirmed by their customers with all kinds of tricks to confirm the rates of the past, the free amounts for negative interests continue to decline.
For example, the German Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100,000.
Now she has just halfed the amount of free and even celebrated for the day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros at Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
However, these lower amounts are now applicable to the entire German Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB currently popular with cost-conscious customers has reduced the amounts in two stages, first to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
After all: More than 100 banks now have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less according to the numbers of the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000. However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres which have even been entitled in the first instance before the Berlin Landgericht.
The banks are already discussed whether the institutions may be able to make recoveries - in the event that the upper instances also explain the negative interests in principle for inadmissible and many millions to bank customers have to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywoods.
But their life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the U.S. Magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, who in 2021 made the "friends" reunition and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" birds, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, styleists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, Aniston, they enjoy a chip on the day (yes, correctly read: an intricate chip from the bag).
Yet that you fly to the hearts of the female and male fans likewise, is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has pech with luck - and still seeks the great love.
And the baby wish has removed from the list.
In the past, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and glory will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikönen must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from the formula 1 remained even less than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat from the front.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light band touch, Räikönen had not even half of the Renndistance to postpone his Alfa Romeo at the big price of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the winning of the World Championship in 2007 in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich takes 60th World Cupsieg - Nolte victories in twoerbob - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björnalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've realized that I had to go nine and a half victory per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026," said the double-olympiatic of BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First on Saturday, he defended the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundred centuries, in which he drove from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and ran out a larger predicament on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he went ahead of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have taken a greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22th victory in series.
John Lochner, who travels for Stuttgart, came to place two before this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Felnbach landed by Rank four in the first race on the place eight.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took the third season victory in the twoerbob on her homeway.
After it was only enough for the fourth place in the monobob in the morning, she rested on Sunday at the German triple success with anchor Deborah Levi to the World Cup.
Twoerbob-Olympician Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came to line two with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first Podest Square in this winter next to her Olympia qualification.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed on three places with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podestplatz in the world cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were all right," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just pushing, but there's also a huge deal to do about it."
Jamanka was a little anxious about the non-complete rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I just didn't get it, so I couldn't resolve why I finally asked.
Through Corona I had quite different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now he said it was out of my mind that was very angry.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to give it back and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment started only on 16.3.
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No until I tippe on it comes an extra field with the report
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong-supplied word.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new injury.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, lovely girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write and maybe it's the one-- or others too...
I'm 24 years old, I have kPTBS, full-time student and Hundemama - sometimes except that my dog doesn't scream or go into the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (from 6J together) is sick, has got a burning 2. degrees on Monday and has been depressive for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also keep having emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have crushed a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (a hand is in the band wg burning).
He's cooled upside down and we're currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much to do with my needs of affection and love.
My dog's just got stomach wound, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cupcase and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and squeeze for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we will also have to keep our homework, which we naturally divide.
But cooking yourself is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well disadvantaged, I am halfly well-treated and managed.
Not good, but I'm gonna be fine and I'm almost symptomless.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 o'clock I have a written test for which I have done nothing and over morning anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something for.
And next week I have an oral test immediately on Tuesday, and what then comes in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left.
So my week goes like this: just until over morning, then it's weekend.
But after that, is everything going on?
Just until birthday.
Only until holiday starts.
Just until weekend.
Just until...
And that's how it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Are you all right?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I cannot understand that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that's also partly related to Mental Load of Women and so I thought I'd probably find suffering companions here...
I wish you one more relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today, unfortunately, the whole different color plus surface is cratched and table leg has printed.
In the first delivery, the color was just as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're gonna switch the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email to cancel was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two more times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found in school that many religious teachers did not believe in God and it was just another professional for them, such as mathematics or geography.
For me, this was always a strange thing, perhaps even because I was raised as a Christian, and I always believed.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to tell about working and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
It also gives a teaching plan, etc.
But if it was just strange to have a physician who did not believe in the relativity theory.
Then what makes you want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
Culture true or so?
Hope you ask isn't too private.
Can't be changed or not?Do you like to write English that I understand well?
That's been a long time, then I'd take care of it.
It's okay, thank you.
I'm expecting a return until the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie Search Help
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (in 24 years).
I think it's been a movie for youths.
In the film there are two contemporary axes (or parallel worlds).
For one thing, the modern (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it in any way in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the ways cross and it creates a action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to be able to live themselves, I mean.
I think the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fighting each other.
If this is something I say, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one sleeped only on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around, no coshed animals, often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No kiss.
Axo and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Look at your child when he sleeps.
Is it turning the head to the side?
Can it get out of the abdomen?
Or is it with the face ahead directly in the mattress?
That's what you can tell me if everything's okay.
We all grew up, and when my husband came into the world, it was tb gang and would be that you put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
Besides, we are already "stamkunde" with you and have already bought very many items
But why are you offering me only 20 euros?
Hello, I've already written with a colleague from you last night and hasn't been back yet.
It's about my dressing dish that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I'm asking you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at the moment.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
Only it is simply that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on large bedlet tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Citat Arno: You want to be "no running fat column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising agent trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Those of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they may continue to insult the people.
A champion who is completely lacking of empathy and at the explosion of the action with the exploded rooms attempts to make axle.
How to find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a ruck call, because my delivered wooden table was defectively defected.

Whether as a comforter at stomach pain or simply to cushion – My little warmth friend is a variety of usable.
Kirschkern kisses are a traditional housing for welcoming heat applications, as Kirschkerne can take warmth very well and dosate again.
The removable interior can easily be warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel safe, even if they do not feel so well.
The Kirschkern kiss referring to heating is only suitable for the following areas of use:
Before heating the cushion for untypical smell, floor or fire spots, check and dispose of immediately when there is any.
Please take the inner kiss out of the reference before warming!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (notify the microwave manufacturer's details!)
Directly after heating, the heat is distributed evenly in the kiss!
Then put the inside kiss back in the reference.
The first heating may result in a mild humidity formation on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Follow the indicated heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy performances can cause damage (the risk of inflammation and burning!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s use instructions.
After the warmed interior kits have been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the kiss for fitness for babies (max 43 °C) on your arm bows!
Do not use kissing in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverful diseases, circular problems, fresh haematomas, blood clots and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour disease, as well as pregnancy, please contact a physician before use.
If nuts have opened and loose cores come out, discard the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the child’s temperature should be monitored regularly during the application to exclude overheating!
All serious occurrences related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli victories in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of the return to the football liga.
Hannover 96 works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it is not even under the third trainer.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over Interimtrainer Christoph Dabrowski and Frust in Ingolstadt after the failure of the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network part.
I have re-covered this five months ago, so I should still work.
I thought that network part alone was enough to operate too.
Missing indicator, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite mounted power part.
Then I increased the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Will you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want to deliver the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is....
Often on a tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of fitness also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely dispersed using the polished FlexFold sharers.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separated from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configureable interior.
With the "Update" of Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still present in a new look.
The good, minimalistic design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the interior of the backpack and still provide rapid access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventional via the cap cap which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proved to be at the Messenger bags.
There is a locking box of metal with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Different from the most backpacks, Peak design has designed different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed, in which the locking hooks can be mounted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
The cloak lock and crochet are also magnetic.
Thus the backpack can also be closed reliably without attaching the crochet.
The second option also distinguishes everyday backpack from other, photo racks: Besides the cloaker, there is another rip locking on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to go through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the daily fitness of the backpack: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel bags.
In Everyday Backpack, you can configure the inner space individually (more below) and thus distinguish both without problems - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack out from the right side of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things stay safely in the left backpack and do not come between them.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable tragic belts help.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also completely manufactured from 100% recycled, wet-fast nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from her support.
#NAME# has me an email from confirmation for the mission of
Announced contact with the Speedition to pick up the wrong-supplied table.
I haven't received any message until now.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one I came beyond the promise that I receive an email as confirmation.
This is the return of the incorrectly supplied custom #NAME#
So it's gonna be a look at when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is no option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for helping
Wish you another nice evening
Hello, my orderer is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was 12 1.21.
I was delivered a totally different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you prolong my bill, I'll give up a bigger order, but anyway I kept the damaged furniture piece and didn't send back.
And that last year was different from thought, I couldn't know, and I just couldn't fix it up and clear it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.

Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event made the history of the western coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered in the water at the southern talent of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread rapidly and resolved the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest and thriving cities of the country.
Areas were closed, tents were set up, and Saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the country's wealth.
For many, it said: "Coloma or Bust" (coloma or bankrupt)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth and wants to make a name.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, cooperate horses and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding streams and neighbouring areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues, not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, have to keep your resources and create a tableau which is more and more "working" for you (sogeneant "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or to apply rules to your benefits.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years of 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official government).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
While each round, the players will choose a location on the board where they can perform actions secretly.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has most of the pioneers, he gets a lock!
This disabled half of the location - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternating actions, such as the gain of resources, the movement of cars, the establishment of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of shops and the positioning of revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round the prize turns to a new location and thus modifys the available actions.
This continues until the prize has moved five times, so each location has once hidden and the year ends.
There is a shooting shop in which the players of Coloma have to defend against an attack of angry bandites.
If the players have accompanied enough revolver heroes and are numerously superior to the bandites, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation.
The player with most victory points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it immediately.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a happy guest in Talkshows and holds talks throughout Europe.
With his book "Why to become our children Tyrannen" (2008), he launched a violent educational debate.
Former patient: infants and educators now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsibilities must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetchek: Countries consult on the loss of the test obligation for three times vaccinated
At the next meeting, the Ministers of Health in the countries want to decide on a boundary disappearance of the test obligation for three times vaccinated.
"We countries need quickly clarity, whether and when for three times vaccinated, the test obligation can be abandoned," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister Conference, the "picture on Sunday".
The disappearance of 2G plus for three-fold vaccinations is "not only medically useful but also provides an additional vaccination," said Holetschek.
The Federal Minister for Health, Karl Lauterbach (SPD) agreed that he will make a proposal to this conference on Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
How am I doing best?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat area is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer handle my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I've updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sentimental perceptions under Full Narcose.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
Most frequently it comes to hearing noise/stems, rarer to see pictures and most rarely to see pain.
For this topic relevant: Emperor cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of Awareness, as a child's protection is avoided by very deep sucrose until the absorption.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcose talk.
Several anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read their comment incorrectly.
The chair is defective.
There, unfortunately, the 20€ do not help us.
These are legal guarantee rights.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is also standard in the eCommerce area in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check if they take back the defected chair at least.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an e-mail you didn't answer.
The question again.
In order and on bill, the product is delivered up to a room of my choice.
The spediteur is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they deliver only before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know any person that can carry me the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Isn't I called?
I had made a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97 years
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intent.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, printing fresh: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diarium of a slow departure from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I've witnessed my life thanks here."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most commonly used is Europe's plains, normal wooden palettes, which are used mainly in the European area as chargers.
They are certified by the European Paletten Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria in Austria, 2020, over ten million pieces of pallets were produced.
The production value was about EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported to Austria annually, will not be collected

Rouload Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips for the perfect Gulasch here a week ago.
It was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterfly!
So thank you again for :)
Now I've come to the taste and want to cook to Silvester for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll set up a bovine fund for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but that's what I get
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check that.
Where there are in the room Lübeck or Christmas brats
For many people, gans or ente belong to Christmas days such as the ton tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now the time will be short.
We'll tell you where you're getting a Christmas bread in Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor scare.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME rules, you can set the desired level and on the other hand the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and distortion.
Further above, it was already announced that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even make a performance reserve when it is uncomfortable.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL rules, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone box can also be used as line output.
This signal is being processed with a box simulation, so you will receive an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX books so you can join your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
If you also spend a VFS5 foot-key, you can also conveniently call the sounds by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and the pace of compatible effects thereafter "tab".
This is essential for the live operation.
With its new power packages VOX goes another step in the future!
But had seen this in others.
Is there any way to send the lamp back to you?
Because she hangs too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me?
What about the commode?
Do we get an update to the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it's not possible, I'd also be satisfied with a restraint or a bill.
I may find a customer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for the goods I do not need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) at the scheduled hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the re-examination of the International Atomic Agreement, progress is made according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the topics to be held on the agenda," said Iran's head dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of Irna's news agency.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first it has not even ruled agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna discussions on the reliving of the agreement had been continued after nearly one week’s interruption.
The negotiators of Iran, Germany, UK, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in negotiations.
Thüringen excessed Saxony - Free state now state with highest Corona incidence
Thüringen has resolved Saxony and currently shows the highest incidence across the territory.
As the only federal country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thüringen was the only federal country at the Corona incidence on Sunday above the mark of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had last always shown the highest incidence throughout the territory, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen had decreased slightly but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new inflammations were reported with the Sars CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection within one day.
200 severe covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, reporting delays may occur.
In addition, healthcare professionals have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly aftercoming with the discovery of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only happening at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this and stick to the package and give it to the post, wasn't it?
I don't have to click/define/fill any more?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I write to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for changes
##Bandsday is greeting me, I am U/StratorDE in the hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the day of the month, you can find one: it is not exhaustive.
We came to a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
Most of this is likely simply related to the dissatisfaction, as some things have gone out here and as we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many here really have bock on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
This is where the Community is asked around the MBundesday, which will keep it alive.
The incidence came from u/edizVEVO, which has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, simply said, shirt hope.
After some writing and writing, several people from the Community have found their desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only so can this project have a existence in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBundesday work in the future?
* What existing orders must be modified / adjusted / removed?
* How will we come out in the future?
* How are new members to be hired?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but what's not bad, we have the discord at the end.
If you want and have time, come on the Discord, work with us and let us democraticly decide on the future.
I've ordered you a lamp screen that's still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clouded for it and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspendment.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are they also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective safe will be picked up for a while.
And I'm asking you to move now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the ceiling as far as possible for the pick-up - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# as this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me phone at any time to agree to a collection date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or choose to return?
How do you answer the question: Why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She himself once lived a while vegetarian, and now it's probably rarely eating meat.
I was a few years ago also vegetarian.
On the question whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned interim step, I have answered honestly without considering much.
And I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but sometime reflected and understood that I finally also supported animal torment.
Therefore, my decision to be vegan.
At the moment I had the impression that came to her side of discouragement, then she defended vegetarism and said she knew where her flesh came from and was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly put into a corner as a veganer and arise conflicts without which you would create it.
It greets a harmonious veganer (;
It is not clearly an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my retours on site.
Since I cannot be on site because of a funeral, this cannot be changed.
I would like to have an alternative pick-up date.
From the 01.02.#NUMBER#, I have come back constantly.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Salvation: 45.000 Euro Aid from the country
Recently, the Rheinland-Pfalz Interior Minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnstein Council House delivered a grant notice of EUR 45,000 for the new Equipment Car Water Salvation of the Volunteer Firefighter Lannstein to Oberburgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135.000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country Rheinland-Pfalz supports us in this,” says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfil over and under water tasks in the water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a permanent expectation of increasing operations: the tree of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel as well as the increasing use of the lans as recreational flow contributes to this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then started the problems.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and the app has reloaded NOT worked.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has spent me a lot of time and now hopes for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

For the first time, thank you for thinking about the whole thing here, I also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, we also talked about arms in the executive, I would not like to go to it!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that the public servant of course comes rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
The fact that, of course, in the special uniform and weapon carries people right from conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then of course be difficult to deal with the living reality is obviously also clear, because you of course have many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and thus I do not mean the exaggerated feminine crystals now, because they are in the executive rather less to nowhere but quite normal men and women that you don't notice if they can't tell you) and also on these people, and I must rely on them because, doubtfully, they save your life or set it for you.
But even these border groups, even if it sounds strange for the first time, my experience seems to be a conservative attitude, speaking proud of Germany and feels more depressed by exaggerated left politics, even if this policy is supposed to work for them or thinks it is necessary to make them right, they simply want to be treated completely normally.
Back to the rights, because of course police and armies are also a cross-section of society, extreme rights will also be found there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even shake openly any state-threatening plans are completely exaggerated and annoy me too.
Of course, police and soldiers who have often been in abroad often begin to pause because of negative experiences, and sometimes also say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also happening that right attitudes may also meet those who engage in a regular exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I think that this is a good fight and also a political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally cracked, and that is so good as I think we couldn't afford to have the right racists and Nazis in our rows at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order that's no longer available.
I talked to #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the edge of the part of the wood are two deep baskets filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
Ordered by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been dealing with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure time), but all my life I get more bad than right to keep my household clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then when and when it packs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's actually never so "that someone might come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not (sorry) better either, although it disturbs me somewhere, but mostly loses household simply against work and unpleasantness.
The kitchen is still cleaned regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you get better with a child?
We have nothing but work on it, and this question has been working on me for a long time.
For for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me as much as no visit is coming and, for example, always fresh clothing is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incitement with a child or do you stay a bitch?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new and high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offering a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allowing a nearly unlimited freedom of movement.
Preformation with special, further embossing of the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arms and knee bows)

The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially in deeper diving passages (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have trained in the area of software development and have now been taught for about a year.
Unfortunately, I am increasingly aware that this profession is not the right thing for me, why I have been thinking about restarting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an uncertain (e.g. fearfully avoiding) personality disturbance (EEVPS).
That means grossly that I have no sense of self-respect and therefore be shy.
I have no problem talking to people at a reasonable level, but I find it very difficult to have more relaxed conversations and I have been told more often that I work unusable (which I think has already improved).
Can I be so social workers?
I don't want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth course, but rather in such a drug advice or family assistance.
However, I do not know whether the actual working everyday life is really the way I imagine it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it draws me down every time there is something to disagree with my code ("always the simplest things acknowledged") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know how this is going to be"/"I'm holding him with my stupid questions away from work"/"he really needs to think I'm really less funded" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it in place.
But you've already got the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation.
I'm waiting for a date for pick-up
What do they mean to give back?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message will not be authorized by your #PRS_ORG#
Is there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my safe.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed breaks the bird in its stomach tarm dragon into the individual protein structures (amino acids) and builds from it its own body proteins, which it also needs to produce for the formation of feathers.
Feather formation in the nestling and fibre rehabilitation in the moussing bird is extremely complex and for the total organism of the animal associated with a particularly high demand.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise may occur in breast-feeding.
Following this coherent administration of NECTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NECTON-S (Multivitamine preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral product) should be re-administered.

1 g NECTON bio at 250 ml of water or 100 g soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/smooth feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A stroken measuring spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g NECTON-Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or three-fold dose of NECTON bio can be administered at the beginning until the approach of fierce rehabilitation is visible.
After that, the normal dose will be reached until the feather rehabilitation is complete.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as a office chair.
How can a office chair be broken after 9 months?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really a bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to notify that my order has arrived damaged and images have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Pronunciation of a co-worker in contradiction with the Statute
Hello R/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
We're going to have a whale tree falling on our property.
So you have made a case request to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus also the whales are not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the whale is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the statement of the staff or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a disposal or a ticket?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that is the only question of whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany.
Can you check that?
Elevation: Severe transport accident in self
Recently, there was a serious traffic accident on St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plötzberg.
As the police press alarm currently notes (14:03 p.m.), a car came into the counter traffic when they were picked up.
There are injured ones.
I understand.
Well, then thank you again for doing so easy!
Counsel and ideas for further vocational life
First of all, celebrate Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head just breaks everything you can think.
Before I get out of here now .. shortly: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm just making the Ref as a cross-border.
Originally I studied something else and worked there also in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise here).
But it was too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometimes I landed at the teaching office and was sure that it is - even though the framework conditions are significantly inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care about that.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job tenders".
And it's only half a year.
During the paints before it, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, afterwards I can still swing around.
But I'm absolutely finished right now.
I had so little free time the last month that I'm completely fooled.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my festival evening.
That's where I had free.
And the stress at work was no matter in the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these star structures that add to me nervous.
In principle, it makes fun and looks at outside, the Ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so.
But I'm completely lured and wondering how much stress my body endures before it completely closes - if he's not doing so already.
I wonder whether I would like to have this for the rest of my life - just if I read some contributions from you here - or whether I shouldn't go back to the old area, since where I was valued, I could take free time if I needed them, and although the work was somewhat boring, but was properly paid for it and together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter like this is the most time.
But then I wonder if I didn't come back to the same place in a year as I am now and dissatisfied.
You notice that it's all somewhat worse, but maybe you've come out as an external advice or ideas, how I'm getting out of this situation, which I'm complete and just starting to cry at the smallest thought.
I will not make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologizing for my weird undertone.
I hope that my situation has become a little clear at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has progressed steadily, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the Valve Reactor scope, which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to the latest update of technology in matters of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and amp shells, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity which is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage valvetronix tube pre-amps.
This is partly based on real analogue switches, because they simply get better to the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this cleared switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed cabin and a bass reflexing system, from which the natural resonances are only spraying.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and curve historical facts at the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to satisfy newly added sound requirements, which has again led to a performance slide of the VOX Valvetronix series, with more dynamics and numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to make all guitarists looking for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuancated playback of game dynamics and pitching as well as a prompt speech.
During an incoming analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end level mainly determines the tube character of a amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor-containing with a 12AX7 tube of each VT+ amplifier perfectly represents the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Lose Magic on Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic stops in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can shine - for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, however, it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost the magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main case is also adaptable: with three individual placing and foldable ceiling parts, it is directed according to the needs of your photo equipment and is thus suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full format mirror cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the objective.
A possible decoration would be a DSLR camera with an employed objective, two to three interchange objectives and an extinguishing flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further objectives.
In addition, there can be plenty of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-external things.
Drohnen-pilots also meet an optimal choice with everyday backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak on La Palma: probably the longest of history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the lava streams have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, with 84 days, was considered to be the longest on the Atlantic island near the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, volcanologists still have no idea when to end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best message is that they are stable," said the President of the Council of Islands, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Injury in millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees of the hot Lava has destroyed nearly 2900 housing houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be over EUR 900 million.
In front of the coast, two new landing tongues arose with a size of about 50 hectares.
Especially the most important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the about 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and who was in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas stands before the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been linked to the spiritual atmosphere and the knocking tension a little deceived in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
It is therefore more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Muss, was a peace-founding "Company Contract of Natural Populations", could be deviated from the stable routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christian child
Strictly, there were the Protestants, through which the Christmas days were closely linked with the gift.
Previously on the Nikolaus day, gifts were given in some way.
The background of this popular practice today is that the Holy Nikolaus, as a bishop of Myra, threw three women in one night secretly gold into their windows to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots, especially the children, with gifts.
Protestants stood on this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and the people as "sacred worship".
For these reasons, they retain themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from the Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift moved to the sacred evening.
Since most Protestants do not see such detail questions as closer, it is only the few that the use of the Holy Nikolaus is still a solid part of the precautionary time, similar to the Martinssingen and Martinsurvey.
Today, in boots are found in front of the doors and under the Christmas tree from socks to luxury eager to all the desires of the heart.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of gift since the 13th century on the day of the Holy Nikolaus.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift was shifted to the sacred evening.
However, in all Christianly characterized countries, a joyful kiddel has the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region, whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or the Christmas man, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some types of own.
This includes, for example, his white bulb, which has little in common with the rather stricter acetic bar of the historical figure, its sleeves drawn by retirement and the preferential of the camin in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while it is the witch Befana in Italy, which must have guided them to the way to the Son of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, the gifts are sometimes offered by fabulous beings, while in Russia it brought fathers frost to some glory.
Here are three horses who are pulling his slides as a troika.
In Czech Republic, the parent country of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for giving the gifts.

Police shoots suspected ban crowns near the king's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a weapon and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
It had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the scene.
The police did not go out of a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages are placed.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

Pillen problem
Hello, dear female people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year, actually saved my first post.
To my problem: I started to take the pills about five years ago, especially because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and fuck PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to let this remain again because I have to take enough medicines that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, not the pain, but my skin.
I had received some of my last two-year break from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickle and this everywhere.
As far as superficial, but I've been pretty stressed and I haven't felt well.
In the two years of break, everything has never really normalized.
Maybe somebody has any suggestions to avoid that this time.
My cosmetics are free of perfume and without a genotype, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor has not taken me so seriously and the skin doctor's date is still coming.
Many love thanks to each one who has read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertary severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then huge knee fleeting and the acne topic.
Food I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and have remained on sugar, milk and meat poor mixed food, because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonal is simply the worm in it, but if you have a place like I have everywhere you want to stop looking for something else that's still wrong.
I already had all of her colleague semina o.a.
Writed and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concerns.
I've always got to work and get on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is to test if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.

110-kV cable is rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation for the transfer of the new high voltage cable at ton is legal.
The decision of the Government of Niederbayern opens the way for construction, which is to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres of the earth's cable will connect the ton in the north of the municipality with the existing 110 kilovolt guide between Simbach and the parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of release near the village of Edermanning at Reut.

Can you tell me how the other process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I have explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a commode of glass and the entire pages are placed up, so there is glass everywhere and the carton is broken

Ref: Planning education (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the ref since the summer, the lessons are fun, but I have still great problems to plan my education in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also only copy s/w for free (which is nervous for societies).
I now just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the issue of geofactors and I am actually standing for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are also repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I am always going from learning target (what I want to achieve) and then wonder how I can build it (mostly I create a workbook with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book, I'm rather dissatisfied.
That is why the work leaves also.
Maybe a pedagogic instructor can be able to work time-effectively with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would really like to finish the retours for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade fears for Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most businesses only who is vaccinated or healed may still be allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales breakdowns.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G rules corrupt the important Christmas business from the view of the German Trade Association (HDE) to retail trade.
In the case of businesses with articles of non-day need, sales breakdowns should be complained, criticised HDE head business leader Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE under 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already cancelled the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Dealer with 2G access restrictions, therefore, lost nearly one third of their pre-crisis rates during the past week.
It's good only in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business leader.
"2G in purchasing does not bring us further in the fight against pandemy," he stressed.
The current rules scared customers and demanded high staff efforts.
He demanded that the bandage system be approved on a boundary basis.
After that, each customer should only be controlled to 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all businesses with the received band on this day.
In addition, in retail trade, as already in public transport, the 3G rule (vaccinated, healed or tested) should have sufficient sample checks.
The German Euroshop property group specialized in shopping centres also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at about 75 per cent of the pre-corona level without 2G, the turnovers at about 90 per cent.
These figures will now fall safe in the middle of this important Christmas business," said Head of Board of Director Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative efforts, the centre will be attempted to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called bandage solution, where, for example, "the visitors at a central location in the centre can once deliver their 2G navigation and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - uninterruptedly enter all shops". dpa
I have recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and at the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cast with a yellow filler.
That looks uncomfortable.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package.
What do I have to do for the retour now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive.
The light produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flameless.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large surfaces at relatively small distances, is excellent.
Moreover, in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work at both the film set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 -Controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted at difficult accessible locations.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the range of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory places, one of the memory keys is simply obsolete and complete by longer pressing one of the memory keys.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp while turning it off so that, when new switching, the well-known situation remains - very practical in the studio work if the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is due to the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often in possession of photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can react to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set if the battery has enough power - it is a battery ester just as built in - for each of the two batteries a value in the two display displays (the left peak display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the lighter via the supplied power part with electricity.
The construction of the lightning lamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm ceiling to mount, so you can get directly to your photostative.
The inclination is to be reliable by means of firms on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also extremely high-quality and therefore also designed for long-standing and hard use.
In addition, a nail is included in the range of delivery.
It is huge that is also a bag contained in the range of delivery.
This allows you to safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
Damage, that I've been given and she's too small :(
"Party we wanted to hit": Frankfurt celebrates after torque comeback against liver kisses
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of Sieglos Hessen was supposed to be on the way to the next Federal Liga.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration about a grown seasonal start of the soul and victory furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," rejoiced trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to each individual who was with it".
At first, it looked like a new steamer for the now on rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the liver kissers with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," continues Glasner.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
The defense player Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the place for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcome muscle injury, stressed his teammates' morality.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to hit today.
But for the future tasks, Glasner now wants to keep its focus on it, but it also looks well in terms of staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live high-professional.
Now you want to "go on step by step and remain modest" and "treat the tasks at this level until the change of the year".
Next on Wednesday, a foreign game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) is on the program in the course of the English week.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again, or must I wait until the money is redirected and the order is resigned?
If I would, unfortunately, say that I will not be ordering again because it has been a very long time.
Have they been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Steamers for handball women before quarterfinal against Spain
Germany's handball-women swallow after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parket.
To complete the WM headquarters, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers had a defeat and now has to run at the quarterfinal against hosts Spain.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," condemned Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must take a different place against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
I'm sorry we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game we had to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entering into the semi-final, the WM second of 2019 must be significantly increased on the next Tuesday to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German Werferin in the Duell with the three-fold Olympicsist Denmark was Alina Griseels, who had six towers.
"We were just not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and asked: "We have to look forward quickly."
From top to back not at height
Unlike the five tournament games previously, the German crew with the pepper was not high.
Failures and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4-back after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate succeeded the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Griseels successfully completed a rapid contest.
However, the hoped initial inflammation was not this.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly sit in the scene - and if so, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
Thus, the party was running at 3:10 after 20 minutes early, especially as backspace player Mia Zjocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her counter.
In the quarterfinal, however, she may be involved again.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time, the DHB selection came into the game a little better and until the break at least at five gates.
The silent hope of a rehearsal after the change was already there after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas and made it simple to the well-deployed opponent, who at the end of the end counts the medal candidates.
As a result, the German crew could no longer rise to an increase in performance and went as clear losers from the parket.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in Christmas

Is it musical?
Is the Christmas man, the Christian child, or is the gift of Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you make it, everyone is engaging in and around Christmas trying to have it as beautiful as a family as possible.
Whether these are solid traditions or even anything else every year: tell us how it went down or runs out in your family!
please send me any transaction number... or something else that could help with it.

I would like to send a good-card code
as for #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Do they do that?
The title suggests that I am an vaccinator in mobile vaccinations in which (to date only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccined among others in nursing homes.
Since these are soon done to a large part, then partly in vaccination centres continue for me.
I would like to answer questions without time limit on organising and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is due to vaccination.".
In my task field, the information for vaccination, the indication position (person has the right to vaccination according to Corona vaccination and no reasons to speak against), the medical documentation and possibly emergency provision in allergic reactions (meir never happen).
The vaccination itself is delegatable to qualified staff, such as medical professionals.
In Impfeams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but who do not have vaccination (needs?), so that I can do most vaccinations myself there.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "Hudler"?
With this dialect word sent by an amberger, the BR TV broadcast "We in Bayern" has provided for strong thoughts.
But in contrast to many past days, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unfair this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one, "which has to go fast."
That, the people heard of the TV-moderator, was totally wrong.
What the man from Amberg informed the solution, and thus probably made surprisings for many superpowers.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a laptop with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialektic researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulting Bayerian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical oberphical term, derived somehow from the rather known word "Holders".
What was closed with a educational gap - probably also with some who have long lived in Amberg space.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message is always coming: opens - something went wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected, synchronized and repaired the PC.
Nothing helped.
The tyre choice at the race wheel- really so pan-safe?
Tomorrow I was awakened with an acting rank because I wanted to train at least a little for my bicycle tour in the next week.
Said, done, and I drove with my race wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in all the city of the city (this time: Thank you, Krefeld!) happened.
Glass fragments on the route.
Zack, loud circuit, and my rear ripe didn't want to join the rest of the track at all.
Due to the day of the week, I had no real opportunity to get a replacement garment and a replacement hose, I had to turn around with half a bad laugh and take the first train home.
Then it wasn't so bad, perhaps it's better if I practice it again before the cycling tour.
But now I face a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would get this problem more frequently.
Now it was really not bad, because even the old tyres of the president (very nice old man, came off the day I picked up the bike until 1 4 pm 120km!) and who had already referred to it as suboptimal because he was rolling with them for more years.
But if I think I have to make a deck change after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly run :D
Now I came into a conversation with an elderly man at the railroad, who wondered why I wouldn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be indiscriminable.
Now, of course, it sounds very enthusiastic.
But are these really so incredible?
I don't like to spend 40€/slips now, just to get disappointed.
In addition, I wonder: I have at the moment on the race wheel, I think 25x622.
They are also (likely?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me to other tyres at a race wheel generally?
The sulphur page seems to be my absolute! Leaving knowledge rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you once in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Auto kicks against tree: driver fatally hurt
The 53-year-old was punctured on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained reason against a Mediterranean island and then approached the counterway, as the police told.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.

After the publication of our new High End Breitband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also have a reproduction.
SOLO 15 is the new sprout and recalls the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal an appropriately designed foot is directly included in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in the length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle of the SOLO 15 is very well suited for persons whose maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role but are to achieve an extraordinary high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to create almost unfiltered such large sound pressure level.
This does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably grown and very impressive for its size and exactly exciting.
Tonal was aligned with a slightly high-tone increase in the SOLO 15.
This is commonly used in broadbands to optimise the too high frequency of increasing bandages.
Exactly on the hearing area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outside, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be warmer.
Thanks to the score source, the location of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and excitingly precise.
The reference suspected extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic that seeks its same.
Solo 15 does not only supplement our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution capacity and preciseness.
As with all our sets of construction, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the speaker to plan the corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the cabin, the lowering of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the furnier again carries on material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate place to be able to perform the cable without problems later.
With the help of a upper frog, the speaker now follows the opening in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used boundly later.
Backside this opening should be provided with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker chassi as large as possible in the interior.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are given an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture “Detail Phase”.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a plain surface in front of you.
On these are now the back wall, the cover, the front and the ground.
The three stipples should also be used and clothed.
The stipples themselves can vary in the material strength, if necessary, for example, if you want to react to finished performance from the construction market instead of making it itself from 16 mm MDF.
The second side is placed in the next step.
After that, all the plates of the foot follow, the two sides, as well as the front.
The installation of the openings of the bass reflex tube is facilitated by a suitable hole circuit saw or a forest driller, as well as the connector on the rear wall.
Then you use a round freezer to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the foot plate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards the foot plate is firmly clothed with the foot of the house and also screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the signs and prebounds (2.5 mm drillers) of the screw points of the speaker chassis and the connector clamp.
After cleaning the housing of wood dust (sucking off / blowing out), the cable begins to be placed.
The simplest thing is to do this through the 35 mm bass reflexing in the back wall.
It moves the entire and uncutted cable piece for piece through the 8 mm drilling into the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the house, the cable is led to the speaker opening and also lets it hang out quietly.
The Frequency Week is prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the spectrum wike, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: assembly instructions Soft Solo 15.
If the frequency wike is built and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the inside of the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with a little kick, you can drop hot stickers to the opening and lock it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the seal accordingly.
Now the enforcement follows according to the description.
Afterwards, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and twisted with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so the plus line (marked cable) must be killed at the Pluspole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
For the detection, a mat of the vacuum material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the cabinet.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up a order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we will also organise the OSCAST this year again!
> Unfortunately, we are not able to get more than four people in the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short term of announcement.
ABER: At least three people will be there by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at 0:30.
Have some cold drinks, plant good food and make you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
