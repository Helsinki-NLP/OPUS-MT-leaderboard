The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations with Shinzo Abe in Toko.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to establish economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for strengthening nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a Treaty on Defence Cooperation between the two nations.
Carratha police arrested 20-year-olds for fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was captured after the driver had driven it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport policemen in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had watched it as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on the Burgess Road before he buckled down to the Buschland, where the officials lost it from the eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the description of the driver was later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The Carratha Police accuses a 20-year-old man of non-respect for a stop signal and unrespected driving.
He is supposed to appear in Karratha on 23 September before the Court of Justice.
The motorcycle was secured and captured for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands in court for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and no consent could signal."
Webster is also convicted to have raped a second woman in the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scotian highland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae held the hearing for the 17th November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconsideration to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress delegates Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democracy from Minnesota and vice-president of Progressive Caucus in the convention.
Therefore, I proudly present, together with the civil rights icons, John Lewis, the law of staff authorization.
This breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-cooperational forces.
The supplementation of the national labour law to create an opportunity for discriminatory workers to organise a trade representation, to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damage replacement or penalty - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest is to bring the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the relapses that the trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and comply with labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and association law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to approve a Constitution to ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness of the role of workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "workers' rights to association and joint negotiations and trade are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fashism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In acknowledging the need for the workers to organise themselves and to raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or industry.
Agreements which restrict this right or aim to reduce it are zero and insignificant; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt had the Presidency on the International Commission for Human Rights, which designed the General Declaration of Human Rights, as it was adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country asked other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade unions - and that this trade unions should then be allowed to participate in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government bodies - should be protected.
After these rights have been sought in America, it is really very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so the working people must have the right to unite themselves and to gain hearing in a free and open society.
As pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standard of millions of people, work in a wonderful way has created a market for industry and increased the whole nation to unprecedented production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and enlargement of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewe the ideals that America had made up in the past and resolved the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a US federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which the lawyer said that it probably led to the conclusion of all five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was introduced by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and is supposed to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortion, to acquire a patient retirement law at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles in order to acquire their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that the doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions provisionally while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work law conformity while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing is held for the judge in order to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the recent decision in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors won more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana avoid a deceptive law that will take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also covered the physicians from the two clinics that had not joined the complaint and also applied for instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states who have adopted similar laws, whereby courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi as not constitutional.
Key positions of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that medical instruction rights require unnecessary restrictions.
Abort opponents prevent the protection of women’s health by measures, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient instruction rights, informed the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other physicians in the state were forced to stop abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery, said the group.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions, while their application for patient instruction rights would still be dependent.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates caused by ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video hommage online for her mother, who died from eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, where eggstock cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the State, the risk of death during the study was about 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMEAN STUDY: New medicines may slow lung and egg cancer
The researchers investigated the health care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman also affected the chances of survival in diagnosis, the type of eggstock cancer, pre-existing diseases and social and economic status.
For older women and those whose cancer had been further advanced at the diagnostic time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was about 20 per cent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of eggstock cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres than possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedical services in order to contradict distances, she proposed, as possible, a reinforcement of the service of influent doctors in order to allow specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in eggstock cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother aged 33 from the gold coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret decline in household ownership
The decline along with an increase in the number of household owners under 35 years could lead to loss of garden centres tens of thousands of pounds per year when today's young consumers, after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Cernal Group for Garden Products".
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that people with home spend for their garden.
The increase in people living in high urban areas without gardens, the popular procedure to asphalt premises for parking purposes and the declining garden size are further factors threatening the industry, in which estimated £5 billion are sold annually.
In the largest London area, where the share of householders fell from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the minimum expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that dwelling for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can not draw plants.
Guy Barter, headguard consultant for the RHS said, "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with in a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of Garden Single Trade due to increasing household and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also forecast for this year a improved market situation because of the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by opposition policyer Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters from PTV buildings again.
The transmitter set his operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends back.
At the same time, some 3,000 protesters tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a mile away from it, they delivered stairs and stones, equipped with safety forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's withdrawal, but he rejected it.
The army of the country admonishes, however, to a political solution to the conflict to "sustain time and use without violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition policyman Imran Khan proposes that Prime Minister Sharif has deceived the election of Parliament last May.
The protests were escalated in the weekend after Khan and Qadri had invited their attendants to insist on Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders U.S. diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has registered the country's oldest U.S. diplomats for information on a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the businessman of the U.S. message and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine The Spiegel and the Online Magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyzer of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major field of activity for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
A previous report that also had the most important secret service of Germany's Ankara in vision made the Turkish government’s reaction much more angry.
Warning strike: Loading guide threatens with consequences for pendlers
The federal warning strike of the Lokführer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The phase announced for 18 to 21 p.m. concerns all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-way transport;
The main direction of the warning strike is goods transport.

Said the district chairman of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We are expecting considerable failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is the transport of goods.
The German railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences specifically.
Police Chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees in the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The Chief of the Calvià Police on the Mallorca island was arrested after corruptions by businessmen and bar owners in the famous Binge Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Head Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was investigated by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most of the bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of police and employees in the city of Calvià on Friday to the office of the prosecutor for corruption combating Mallorcas.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with corruption claims and are consulted with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the upset night club owners stated that the cousin economy of the authorities had a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about paying money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video, showing an 18-year-old British tourist who took 24 men during a saftour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the proper behavior of alcoholized holidayrs in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the famous alcohol-drinked tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio event took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organisator Carnage must pay together a penalty of 55.000 € (73,000 $).
The tourist place Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British vacationers, is also known for several accidents under alcoholic influence, including the trend of the "Balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has provided South Australia a winter surprise, with strong showers and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already gone down in the night on Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a Guss that started shortly before 20 p.m. and provided nearly 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week had provided a early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of only 15,8 °C.
The bold weather conditions probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a windwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Windstorms reached about 50 km/h on the ground on Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start through at a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an emirates flight from Dubai and a quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16°C for Adelaide is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthias says: Maximum time for big networking
In view of the galoping technical progress that threatens to transform our pleasant home into high-tech shell centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But behind it there is a thought: if the cable wasn't, all the listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be even more significantly retro.
Surely, does it apply to the ecultronic (ekeltronic?
No, typical error: electronic) sector the rule that the world's newness of today's electric scrap of tomorrow is purchased - obsolete.
And, for example, who is still having a tube TV in the living room today, just says that he basically rejects television.
Why these thoughts?
Because the calling of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronic matters.
The Laie, who formerly controlled washing machine and CD players blindly, does not even today understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed before him with infinitely little expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What is to talk to people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quark?
In fact, for about 20 years it has been mainly about the need to network our house.
So that the yoghurt himself reorders, so that the fire reviewer informs us on the holidays that it's burning in the work room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the air conditioning office to our short arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will surely soon be true: We lift our bracelet clock, say, "Sugen!" and the dust saucer will go home.
Irre.
Everything goes beyond nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown goods" finds a industry knower, you can connect the washing machine to a headphone, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven is still needed, but what is not useful because we are standing in the stove.
We also know from everyday practice: If a neumodic device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israelite children from the areas near the Gaza strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air protection spaces, while missiles and mortar shots on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and the Hamas were closed and the schools were closed in Gaza while the area recovered from the fights.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the municipalities drawn by missiles in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fights are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, removed from the walls and railways before the students arrived.
"We have a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident in Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until the war was suspended last week, thousands of inhabitants of border municipalities such as Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the rocket and marble fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border to Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian Mörsergranate, are still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education informed that about a dozen families have not returned yet.
Her children were temporarily spent in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border city of Gaza, which is severely drawn by the Palestinian fund.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said: "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite weapons stop last Tuesday.
The rest of the arms led to an immediate end of the fights; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand of Hamas for abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airports and seas in Gaza.
Israel calls for an unwave of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battles.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel is contributing to these information and estimates that at least half of the victims are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for these information.
On the Israeli side 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 missiles and marble grenades during the battle on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air attacks and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into preliminary protective spaces.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue to fight, educational authorities have deferred the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be opened again so that we can continue learning, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD ban procedure
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has been pronounced for the end of the current NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current ban against the NPD should end before the Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Land Manager in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to find the result of a political fight against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed nearly at the five-percent herd at the vote on Sunday.
A first start for a ban on the legal extreme party failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection had informants in the NPD tip at that time.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
Federal government and federal day did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
The new country place is now placed refugees in tents.
The Central First Recording for Refugees in Harburg is placed from all sides.
Now the internal authority has made up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were only briefly informed - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to support citizens' reserves and give the district politicians no way to contribute constructively to the human residence of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, the Group Chairman of the Greens in the Harbour District Assembly.
Their party claims that the district management of Harburg presently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the initial recording are the storm of seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
So many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a far-reached index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market.
The numbers of RP Data show that home prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, but in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by 5 and 6 per cent by average.
On the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was severely affected by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued that with the spring start now for the next months, an increase in the real estates to be sold would be seen, which would be "a real test" on the market.
"If you consider the constantly high rate of auction prices, a general rapid sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that the home prices will increase further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the manager Peer Medau and certifies this to pose "as a fieldlord".
The university style is not this, says in the Communication.
Thus the Medau family has already been informed in mid-June oral about the attitude of the university.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans were not "preliminary or even decision-making" but "preferencing".
The expansion of the small road to the castle also is less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
It was about a 9 meters wide road and it is not the talk.
It is about 5.50 meters at present, which is a meter wideer than ever," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operator's argument that their free and educated parking areas in the future will only be used by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Train parked will not be at all because this, as with other public parking spaces, can be solved intelligently.
Remembering the Inhabitants
The children's crack of mountains, which is located on the site and which would lead the access to the park cover along the door, is supposed to be "not affected" according to the high school president.
Rather, he considers that this is not only about the childhood, but also about the inhabitants of the Friedrich Strip Street and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it is much more than the particulate interests of the Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the Parent Board of Children's Crisis, with the expansion of the road, would be justified to "the readers can decide themselves" to lose a "the few naturally connected spots of Coburg".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city trees about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context respond to the significance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's crab last week about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new park cover is not supposed to lead through the campus and the Friedrich Strip Street, but through the Medau Mountain.
This would require the smal road to be expanded to a mile length of two tracks.
According to Medaus's high bills, traffic in the park of Hohenfels would be tenfold.
About 2,000 vehicles daily are spoken.
From the city sides, they have not yet wanted to express themselves on the project.
Glandorf retires from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Federal Ligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led mainly to health problems for this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has been mature over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team," the world champion of 2007 informed on his Facebook page.
Thus, he goes to international retirement with a balance of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany.
Because the champion-league winner from Flensburg wants to go to the gate hunt for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces its framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasmed me as they will be enthusiastic to my long-term fellow players and followers.
But for my club, I want to be healthy in the next few years, for that it is necessary for longer regeneration breaks that do not allow the current double burden.
The left hand had to fear his career after a fersen infection in 2012.
Due to problems with Achilles, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortison syringe that had later caused a strong inflammation.
A emergency operation and two other operations followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, which ended the dispute with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years National team career is not going by a body without trace.
I have some health sites that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot operations that took place in 2012, I never managed my blood pressure correctly.
This includes some other sweep-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I could control my head, but my body couldn't cheat," explained Glandorf in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He'd only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"If all the stripes rip, I'm always speaking ready," explained the two-fold family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble as regards my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least a little straight.
In addition to the WM title 2007 and the win of the Champions League in 2014, he took the EHF-Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, with Flensburg, he secured the Europapokal of the Pokalsier.
German economy in spring decreased by 0.2 per cent
The crisis around the globe has broken the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the prequartal.
This informed the Statistical Federal Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
The economy alone lived in the spring, while investments fell.
The external trade also broke the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual increase, a total GDP rate of 0.8 per cent for the first half of the year is a total of 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which first led through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer".
The largest cycle sports association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
It deals with the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants, with their registration at Jos ter Huerne, thanked for the organisation of this tour through the Münsterland.
Posted in various special magazines, this tour was offered interesting.
We're coming from Den Helder and we're driven overnight to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists rejoiced over the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the company of the Guardian brotherhood Sta.
Katharina went to a small "Fried Travel" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
Further, the route, which was deprecated for three different categories, led towards Herrenholz over the Schöpinger Berg towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and imagebeck back to Horstmar.
On distances of 95 kilometres with 1175 height meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 height meters, the bicyclers proved their good condition.
They were spent on the way in Havixbeck and picturebeck.
The main organiser Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Deputy Heinz Lölfing was very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all the people involved.
The organisation went without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive phase of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organiser had hoped, which was likely due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We see ourselves again in 2015 on hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised, however, to return to Münsterland and plan a new edition.
Constantine Weckers Fairly Honest Memories
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin Wecker, Songmaker, Pasifist, Polite Safe Activist, Ex-Happy, brought to paper in "Munk and Warrior" on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thought fetishes for thought fetishes, the Munich born on 1 June 1947 wrote down his memories, initiated each chapter by a suitable song text.
And he is unfairly honest: from onanie as a gymnasiast to shop steal and drug use, he does not expose human weaknesses.
To show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but as much more important terms: love, soul, ego, that being in Now, Spirituality - all this he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also, as did not only the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
Lastly, the Lebeman Constantine Wecker also approached the ascetic monk, which is "founded by subtraction", as he says, "by letting away everything unnecessary".
But between all the high-spiritual views there are also short anecdotes for the earth: for example about slaughterery in a place frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, where he showed a tree frontally.
Even there he is unfairly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is proof of a comodie, Rudy's rare records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and created from the series on radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "much" treatments after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, only he heard his voice, "Don't stop the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to his jaw and talked about things like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a poetry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of his father, he gained an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little clearer now, but they're dark, roasted, deep stiff labyrinth with flames and smoke and a lot of rush.
My father just lay down in the basket before, and then he was slowly heard how he began to sing because he was able to wash the jet from himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him became bigger.
Yet Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother got bad at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop the "I love you"?
Stop embracing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French who he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitnessing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was commended by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It followed the comedy of the mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the Sitcoms and comodies who have filled his business life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career started in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/Comedian on television for a quite long time."
He was learning in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient joke story machine, while I was a star by television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minimumrel show, a light entertainment program in which the people were "blackly painting," Henry took his Comedy up there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it never had happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked with giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "yearly priced light pillar of British television" was also a "large parodie of black people."
Through the introduction of figures that were ridiculed by the British black culture, Henry worked in the eighths on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to a mission in 1984, and in the nineties, he was known among other things as CEO Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chief!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film rolls were his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What do you do next, Len, because it feels like you're just taking the time or stepping a little in the place."
Afterwards a series of documentary for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first sequence was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was quite allergic.
I never really learned about him at school, and I thought he was mainly a domain of middle class, white ones in crawl pants and a head of carbon in front of it.
So I was very scared of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines from Othello's last talk for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt that I could do this.
It was almost like someone put my head right at last.
"This is why it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, search a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to break over 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a theatre, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences on Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tensions.
This also came well, so it's like a great shield of the gods who tell me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNENT Voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love that.
I love being in a test room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous outbreaks while he is always imitating people.
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for it, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes act live in Apollo, if I want it, but there isn't so much to me as before.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part, and the end of a trip - I don't think I want to give up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be a actress.
It's funny.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebells block streets in Jemens capital
In conflict between Shiitian Huthi rebells and the Yemeni government, Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemenic media reports of a transport chaos in the capital.
According to the online release of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the paper, with a further escalation of the conflict, his demands should not be fulfilled.
The Shiitian Huthis fights for more independence from the Sunniic ruled Yemen and demands the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has besieged the Jemenite capital for nearly two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large routes of Sahara.
In the surrounding country there are constantly bloody fights with the Jemenite army.
Kenya registers officials in order to impair "Geisterangestellte"
Kenya has started to register all government officials biometrically to remove "Geisterpersonnel" from the government's wages lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid were a government message.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to combat corruption in public service at his office in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, a test found that at least $1 million (EUR 700,000) per month was lost on payments for "geist workers" and other misuse financial practices.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was notified in a government notice.
All those who did not do this without a credible apology would be deleted from the wage list, the communication continued.
"Through this approach, it is essential to rationalize the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also fixing the wage list at both government levels - so the "geist staff" is eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Decentralization and Planning Ministry.
The scandal about the art advisor Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before the court on 11 November.
Five inheritors of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, call for 19.4 million euros injury reimbursement by Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency procedures in a civil process at Düsseldorfer Landgericht.
This was told by a judicial speaker on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach has deceived the purchase of artworks and old Timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This also increased the agreed provision.
Achenbach has purchased 121 million euros value items for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
44 years he was in school service, 23 of which he was head of school.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many Petershausen and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his strive to see people in the students.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
Already with 14 he was interested in the teacher's profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were dismissed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern in 1946 - in the Güterwaggon.
Thus, judges smote into the Upper-Frankish Senkendorf.
The teachership took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to run six miles a week to the next train station, traveling to Bamberg, three kilometers across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Judger got a sleeping place in a red-creuz home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow schoolmates in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first, and in 1954, after three years, the second grade of the State.
Since he had no free teacher's office, he ordered to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Froulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he visited a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Petershausen five.
From the school year 1968/69, these were summarised in Petershausen in today's Council House.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a refund in the now smaller school, then the dawn director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to engage in the modern construction, which was expanded in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of Mayor Ludwig Götz in that time, who, in addition to the municipal cost, had built a workroom and the enlargement of 1997 cellar spaces, although this was not eligible under the school building directives.
"Citizen Champion of God was very school-friendly," remembered judges gratefully.
In all his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had replied to a talk of a school council on justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter changed what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "This doesn't always work." Whether he's talking about his students or his six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, judges were sometimes unconventional.
When pupils beat themselves, he did not get them a punishment work and did not dodge them for seating.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had created two pairs of box gloves and let the two contradictors approach each other, even if there should be a veil.
To the benefit of the school, judges as a director held a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the parteilosen judge after his retirement to attend at least 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the municipality.
However, judges were elected in place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists are located in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Schoten Interim stops
When cyclists on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schoten Rast, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday alone, however, the number of rasts impressed: The 700 participants of the Mr4-Radtour and Begleittross enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Schotten Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radles and celebrate on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and had a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists attacked the first stage, the 60 km from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the head of the private company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshing of body and spirit, all kinds of good things had been prepared: the landwifes from Ranstadt and Low Mock City had backed 85 bleak apples, sweats, scratches and cheese cooks, which were wonderful to the skillful cyclists.
"Some cakes can only back landwifes," a participant from Aulendiebach praised while he ordered another piece.
At the drinking level of the Giß-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments could be achieved.
The "Duo Bravo" talked visitors with well-known melodies from opera and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, eventually he has re-fitted cycling chains that have been dropped today."
Because the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the Trincuck house by reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Promotion Manager Tobias Hagen, since the first Mr4 radtour in 2004, was able to take care of shortly, but he had plenty to do with local technology.
His pick-up truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries and made reportages with his staff and the 15-headed police motorcycle stairs of Hessen, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhein-Main region," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulla, Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in Westfalen are cyclists.
The number of participants is a bit based on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression from the site when they broke up after one and a half hours: "Goodbye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they winked to say goodbye.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Oldeburg Park.
Under the government of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Citizen Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival and, of course, they had prepared deliciouss, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as a member of the Board of Directors of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were obviously delighted in the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance beans.
The opportunity for vibrant movements under the free sky was eagerly used on the bicycle despite the sports activity.
Among the guests, citizens who were affected by the good mood were increasingly mixed as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the cyclists stood on the program for the stations Birstein, Watchersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenwalders.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of wheels, the athletes came back to Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they were supposed to have founded a organized criminal association and picked up phone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he informed waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere in Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school manager of the school in Slavjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that children will receive a education that will be useful to them in further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, the children wear embroidered shirts, keep balloons in hands, and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
With a proud glory sleeve from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began at the world management consultancy company Bain and Co., which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bomber, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She was presidency of the Financial Times for seven years and retired when the top post of Pearson's mother company went to a younger male colleague.
Their detection was supposed to be nearly 1 million £.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became the advisor of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside on the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and disturbance when things go wrong.
This provides a almost unholdable duopol, which requires a comprehensive reform.
But the new chairman who arrived would risk taking up everything and breaking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might kill himself his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it wasn't enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overwhelmed.
While the competition moves closer and threatens new technologies with old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145.50 £ per year, the British public is purchasing into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 Pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC rises upwards on the popularity scale: 53 per cent today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The vision and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get message headers on my mobile phone today and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very loved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that lowering Tweet was not authorized
A second from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a decreasing comment on the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of official violence.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account that disputes the previous.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
Personnel of Perry did not reply immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets were out of Perry's official user account, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the former Tweet, a disadvantaged picture of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drunkenness at tax.
Perry committed a veto against the financial support of her office when she refused to retire, which led to a accusation against Perry - which might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The text of the Tweets is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcoholic level ... but if I do, I complain to governor Perry when he pludges it."
I'm the drunkest democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of judicial assistance applied for the judge who was responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the official governor in the history of the State of Texas is unconstitutionally diffus.
Perry stopped $7,5 million of government money at the Public Integrity Unit of the State - established in Travis County and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to retire.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed the election meetings in Iowa during his presidential candidate for 2012 as a fifth, Perry admitted to speculations that he would stop by posting a Tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the apartment market again for "normal"
One of the most prominent building entrepreneurs in London pointed out that the home market in the southeast of England was "reverted" to the normal level.
Private homes in the capital were warmly desired and the subject of enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set the limits for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the highest level of 2013" and added that this offers a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the decline, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the catastrophe, prices in the city area alone have risen by 18.5 per cent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales total.
The average sales prices in Berkeley's private, price-valued and student offers increased by approximately one fifth last year and were £423,000 at the end of April.
However, in the past months, a greater pound has made property property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been disturbed by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric for possible "wild tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
The London real estate maker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which sharper loan arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year, both in the real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the hypothesis permit in July, which also indicates the cooling of the real estate market.
Hampties International, another real estate agency, corrected his forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to down to 3 percent, based on a already weakening home price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now decreased by one quarter per year, says the Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts for the date sales amount to more than 2.2 billion £.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the date sales also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre- tax result increased by 40 per cent to £280 million per year, sales by £18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a report on Monday before the company's Annual Assembly, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley in the current year would likely meet the current market expectations.
Analytics estimate the annual pre-tariff result at 450 million £.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in the London Trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar sale.
Naked photos of Oscar prizemaker Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of 100 other starlets.
A representative of the Star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "exact injury to privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were claimed to be obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud of Apple. The claimed "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of thousands of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took in our home's private environment years ago - I hope you're really satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" however rejects the fact that the photos deal with their images and two-thirds "These so-called naked pictures of me are GEFELESS, people.
Let's defend the beginnings. *Word game intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande departed from her the authenticity of the claimed photos.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly praised new novel about love and the letters "J".
They broke, so they could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a carton you left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, exciting, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And shake his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was terrible, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stabbing was a just starting affair, which had been much more promising for a reduction in the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremendous tender beauty with unbleached hair and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompanyment that Kevern thought to be her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a moist but paradise valley with the treffend name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leak, in the baths were still spiders, naked snows left their tracks on all windows and believed they belonged to all this, and the garden was grown over with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a child march, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The short list will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn handsomely on the broken leaf chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusual warm spring afternoon. Both had joined themselves spiritually in the service console that provided the country with calm music and comfortable news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs remembered him at an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer who had loved his father to listen at closed wheel shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their original aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so right forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsoleted, as the word obsolessed.
The general taste made what was never done with releases and regulations, and how the people in books chose the from counter laundry-to-millionary memories, cookbooks and love romans, they chose the balladens at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sing in a grob-comic serenade of Ailinn's great feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without laying two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It had not been a very funny game at the time, and it was not very fun now too.
He knew that this was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only room for a single "when" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be quite sure where they would end.
It's the same as the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed understanding.
Although he had become 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz about the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or boundaries.
A conform society meant that each element of this society was thankful to the principle of group talent - thankful as those protected from fate.
People with Afro-Caribian origin were suited by temperament and body construction for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by electronic talent like nature and were responsible for the task to ensure that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the canalization; what was left of the Greeks was crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not quickly left the country as WHAT WHERE, WHEN THE SCHEEN WHERE had happened out of fear to be accused of fires, even fear that the flames would eat them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen restaurants, thought to be depressed and became depressed with inactivity.
Everyone according to his ability.
Since she had only heard balladens, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the insulting words that the bowls had just sung her could ever be poured.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the fraudulent feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on the lips again in her presence.
She still thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shaken her head to the unbelievers and locked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her uncommon black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she says without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me yet.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't like that.
Maybe your knees, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knees are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could've said "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"Your thick knees are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the reassuring charm that was needed to count the cruelness that was inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon became red and lifted up from her chair, threw the console and poured the wine they had drunk.
Holunderbloom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to shake, like palm wedding in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you," she said ...
Except that I'm not.
She regretted him both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebeled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same giant and ice-called ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more depraved after DEM WHAT WHERE WHEN it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pepper to pepper, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or slaughtered them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't watch out!
They first knush - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for a erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the non-speaking love balcony from the console - they first knush and then strike.
Kevern believes that this was an unnecessary refining, since the knutch itself represented a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon gave him a sign through her body.
He raised himself out of the chair like an old man.
She felt also bleeding, but the mourning of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You didn't know anything.
She looked at him as he was gone - like from a room in the upper floor her companion saw him - a man, complained by something he had ordered himself up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men generally, although some had lifted up their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, shaking his back, embarrassed, defeated, without a battle spirit - why was that a look that she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher in order of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public atmosphere, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country where, if not abolishing, the most expected was to be invested in the eradication of this violence, in view of the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"There has been much done, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to reduce the native aggressiveness of a people who led a thousand wars and most of them won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was historically seen despite the high-quest church towers between the hills.
But some qualities prove to be inextinct.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to wake.
The people cry when hearing sentimental balladens, depend on stories about overwhelmed difficulties and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rawness keeps rural communities as well as our urban suits in hand, but there are also evidence of the existence of a new and dependent dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less romans.
Esme Nuss Tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you amateur?
"I think I don't have to say that," answered Esme Nuss Tree.
Are you lesbian?
Esme relyed on her right to privacy and refused the statement.
The feminist?
Quiet again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a non-profit workplace.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, may sometimes distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you call "backholdy" and "raw" could be interpreted as well by others as expressions of natural power and vitality.
If you continue to go on the thing that is what is happening, WHEN IT IS IT IT IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential vital power.
Esme Nuss tree looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED letter in Flamingorosa repeated the advice given by Ofnow to the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, hear Balladen, visit Musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, excuse.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to go out," answered Esme Nuss tree with a quiet voice when she was sure that her chairman had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we have not yet been so effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that we may, without warning, find out how to repeat the mistakes that are at all only to THE WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES WHEN IT IS DOES.
But this time, it is not the others that we let out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you call actions "what our grandparents may have committed or not.
You also go too far when you talk about that these would have excluded their "wrath" and their "wraths" to "other".
Actually, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "uns" and "other" when we understand the past as when protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the one, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme dared, "no part of the society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done bad or good, what happened has happened.
That was then.
There's nothing to say about this - we agree.
And just as no debt should be allocated, no debt should be eradicated if such destruction would be appropriate and if there would be a way to destroy it.
But what does the past serve if we don't learn from it-
The past helps us to forget it.
If I can say something about this...
Luther Rabinowitz set his pyramids together.
"I'm going to consider their report," he said and left them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcycle driver who, as passages described, had driven in a kind of "brutal anger" on the footway.
There is accident.
Lesotho-military member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued to have planned a state strike for the crash of the government and said that they were going against policemen who are accused of the army of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country surrounded its residence and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the nearby South Africa after reporting about attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no state de facto, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics" whose army was in place by the police.
"What happened this morning, the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several secret service reports that within the police some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just ahead to cause devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action has made the impression of a surgery.
"Even if no one claimed to have crushed the government by violence, all the reports agree that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho have shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of Lesotho Military informed on Sunday that the soldiers were slowing back into their cassettes and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, the vice-premier Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane informed that he believed he had become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June after Thabane has suspended parliamentary meetings due to the disputes in his unitary government.
He said that his actions would not have undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations for despite.
Production in the euro area in a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, a precisely observed study.
The final marketing manager index of the producing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, according to a position of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of increasing tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall take place on Thursday before the European Central Bank (ECB).
The markets expect a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a delayed recovery of the euro area and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week if he considers a quantitative ease for the euro area, according to those carried out by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Though small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical insecurities for manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trade partner in Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanisms of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to prevent the fire of analytists who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of the production industry in the euro area of August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, since the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and Ukraine - increase unsecurities in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and likely cause some contracts to be delayed or even cancelled, in particular large contracts.
He said that it will be "ever more likely" that the ECB should eventually introduce a type of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible camping of school, as the children in it still suffer.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people of Czech military were taken as hostages at a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death at the crueltat in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible camping of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people, including 186 children, died, the heroic survivors warned last night against a new Apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, this seemed to be the evilest of the evil.
The tragedy united West and East into awe, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst affliction.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death at the horror in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the children like they die - now finds an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to climb back to the scotched school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried to climb back into the crushed school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were bloody.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them safe.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to be operated again.
Some granate fragments are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says strugglingly.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who remained there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the camping will always remain part of her, although the memory becomes slightly weaker each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the picture of me online when I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster, and contribute to this not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, thinks his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russes go to school with seven years) and survived the three-day camping in his mother Tamara's arms.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mamma told me I should go to bed if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Full of fear that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying baby, grabbed it at the hand, and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Wladimir, who locked his son in the arms outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save them."
In fact, Tamara was stabbed out and with bone injuries in the hospital, on the other hand in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, "I cryed for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later fled to London (by the newspaper News of the World) in order to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be blasser in my memory.
I remember that I was throwing away all my toys guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the courtyard, and they didn't get out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the play shop where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top open car.
But now he fears a place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of disaster that he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I'm so sorry about all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me to the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the camping, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence took many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschsch and called them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with servants in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are exactly the kind of children like ours.
I think that for many of the wars, they are part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and this is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know that he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and inflammate candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face turned away from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he was throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all around the body.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I deepened him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on for us, different from many others.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible picture was after the camping as the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the camping in 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His bloody face was characterized by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the Barbarai of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him off for his first day of school before she rushed off to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not completely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer this date, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day that we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intriguing: The image of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was evaded as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgia wanted to go to school this day and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgia doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at our home in the bookcase.
I understand this, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It's important that such a thing can never happen again.
"I doubt that we've ever learned the truth.
People are continuing to examine such tragedy and never learn the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing of such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares because of the camping, but then it got better.
Later, in 2004, I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1 September moves closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friends tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and visited a medical college in Wladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderer terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was captured at the feet of a murderer terrorist during the camping, but he managed to survive.
During the camping, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was mounted at the foot of a murderer terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," said Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the composition.
It's still with me, there's nothing I've left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and actually felt something better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost my consciousness.
I will never return there again and don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the camping on the laptop
My pain is incredible and I carry him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me for school.
I'm fine with my body.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never report my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about it, and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse, when the anniversary comes closer.
I'm going to remember the celebrations.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It's in us.
Georgia is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that if something like that happens.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't take part because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but he can't drive sports.
I would say that he overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the camping and this only strengthens my pain.
I've lost many people I knew well and who were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can't believe that.
We were a friendly country earlier, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that in Ukraine many children have been killed and many are still killed.
If we could only grab and throw out all these rebels - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10 / 1
The baby that has been carried so gripping by a special command in security
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is put in safety by a Russian special operation command (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the cruelties at all
The world kept breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the belagering of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelness, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar kept back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderer.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has with his new wife Svetlana a little girl he called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, doesn't remember the camping and has grown into a intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most priceworthy option is a waterproof point-and-shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition that both are to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras that all are available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery tub and other facilities are closely closed.
Please also set your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimise the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD with which you can compose images, Action-Cams usually do not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image setting is a cause of happiness.
So you do a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode that makes a series of recordings with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramaticly worse, the more you get away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, lake or sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos, the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is particularly important when you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a advisor of anaesthesia, he dedicated his career to save the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, a MI6 worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important to diagnoses and diseases, while the subjects are mainly busy with something very different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble racing myself.
While he struggled with the gripe-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatient to his wife Juliet.
"I prefer everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and without reason disturbed.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do a X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer, which attacks the chest, i.e. the lungs overflowing skin.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre fuel, which once was considered "wonder substance" but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can be ignored as easily.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960s than industry has voluntarily committed to no longer use of it.
Even where he was still set up, only people in certain industries were working directly with the material - clampers, construction workers, roommen, and shipping workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from a different time, it seems hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, as it seems, today experiences the climax of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths caused by mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of Mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in UK
The reason why we now experience the deadly effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types were forbidden), is that a mesotheliom is only developing after decades.
And the gigs of the Mesotheliom are not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no protective space.
Parliament's buildings are asbestos infected.
Also in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been designated as the starting flock.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clamper either.
In fact, it was hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pfortners - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my elderly companions will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who have been trained at the Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
Mesothelioom was diagnosed at Andrew Lawson at 48 years of age.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
This was an unusual long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelio brands die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still get sick?"
The leading expert in the United Kingdom on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when asbestos epidemics are expected to occur in Great Britain, 90,000 of the disease will be victims.
Most of them have no idea that they will die like that at the moment.

A short look at the documents of the courts, which the subjects often turn to because of damage replacement requirements, shows how far the crystal of the mesotheliom is already widespread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had suspended asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are only few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name is derived from the word "asbestim", a description of the fibre structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe isolations, boiler isolations, even for braking in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but the EU and the WHO consider it a "great health risk" with potential death.
But more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it gives clear, but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the unique high mesothelioomrates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical Mesotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects in which it shows that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliome was probably caused by work or at home by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could think of being safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been unaware of the substance in the heart of the government.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of the Parliament had been contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be swept up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Employment Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "pure health certificate", it is uncontroversial that £1 billion must be put to work over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, the Members will meet rather in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "asbest's presence was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos exactly is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day he received such a type of fever at the beginning of December 2009.
He was 45, and just late in the evening he performed a surgery.
Suddenly, I was frozen.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought it wasn't going home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the chest fall, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Amazed doctors took X-rays of his breast and activated pleurakat whether to extract liquid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sporting and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient abbotts with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition worsened again and his home doctor brought his CT scans and ray records to an expert group.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a sun equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rip and the breastfall.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "There was told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan sickness sisters, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It proved that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meet younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were below the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
However, many employees who switched from one building to another in footway tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground cantinents (as Graham Abbott often did) came to contact with the toxic substances most likely.
It is evident that over decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos matts.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbests was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls because of its amazing isolating and flame-hearing properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people must have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now addressed frequently on websites.
And because of this, innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or screwing roofs, they contained asbestos standardly.
"It is an industrial toxicity that is contained in large parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's hospital.
In one case, the only contact involved in a woman was the departure of a garden ship in the 1970s.
So watch out how to ride your gardens.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not focus on what I did.
I was in practice in two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see any more Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change from the position of a physician to one patient was.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not gonna see any more Christmas.
That's it."
Mesotheliom is particularly dumb because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos is spinned up and the fibres are inhaled, they can find themselves in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest fall and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart torax doctor who switched to the Guy's hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "when they are pressed from the breathing process on the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in mesotheliom.
For example, the efficacy of a surgery is hot controversy.
Some think that she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest fall," he says.
You don't come around with the knife.
That's because the cancer says "not very well on chemotherapy," which shows "activity", but doesn't cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Happyly, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man supporting and consultancy office for companions four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he presented happyly on calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that last four months and expected to extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, made it "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart torax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage by not being forwarded, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and have to wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for mesotheliom illnesses in order to see the best available treatments.
But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many of the subjects are of another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave.
And so they turn to the judgments in the hope of remuneration.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realized that a very low burden also represented a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally submitted their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "perfect compensation" because Lawson could not with absolute certainty prove that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
However, after the investigation of his death, a speaker of Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for Mesotheliom-Sick people who strive to compensate for a huge problem, to attribute the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the complainants.
As a response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom-relevants to complain about compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a fund of 350 million £ funds supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can prove contact, but no one can accuse.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 per cent of what a court could have responded to them in a normal replacement process - approximately £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks as many Mesotheliom-relateds that £350 million represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time would not have gone away and Mesotheliom-sickes find the companies and they could normally complain.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in view of seven death victims, rapid action was needed daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy that allows long-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," said Abbott.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
When you give up, you're getting worse.
Graham Abbott undergone the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Follow-up scans did not show any signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life threatening.
That's life-threatening.
Abbott again undergoed six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very hard.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"For parents this is hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease that I wouldn't be old with.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very social and uncomfortable.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restraint.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for Mesothelio-marketers, such conversations have not been made of hope, not of a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (such as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a violent security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong's right to governance, demonstrations swear revenge
On Sunday, despite the increased reputation of democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong elections.
This approach is likely to fire the long-reclaimed protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists were able to plan and mobilise them within a few hours after the explanation.
The decision of the Chinese Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking-trusted candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to deal with an authoritarian regime.
In his defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Resident of the Standing Committee of the National Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants to choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct election law for the people of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the run through a narrowly controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" are to be authorised.
The decision follows a summer where some of the largest and most audience protests have been held in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisers threatened to shoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general election law.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central followers had gathered in the rain before the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organisers said that their movement had achieved a new stage of civil disobedience and planted protest waves in the next few weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers informed that the movement "was considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will take place definitely.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijings for days, and on Sunday before the government building there were intensified security measures including police forces and barrikads.
The disturbances are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The increase in people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear grows that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement, as they threatened the business operation - the lifestyle of Hong Kong.
"The protests they talk about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they persist," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to fear that Hong Kong will be out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported about democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an inofficial referendum on the election rights of 780,000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduations in the United States is now transferred to universities where freshmen are offered performances with the private aircraft.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxurious travel service in Great Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise have to cut their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business speaker said that there are no new bookings, since the service was just introduced, however, added that "studerers would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of £9,000 per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ very different in their expectations and claims from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that exactly.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as rejected.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for university education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start study this month find themselves exposed to a crisis of life-keeping costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships do not take steps with the strongly increasing invoices for the simplest basics of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for as simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the Blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
In comparison with the answers of black women just after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinks to Ferguson by a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you can find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People were forced to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson has revealed problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but which are not considered as "woman themes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colors in their own country are besieged, the silence is annoying.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomia between race and sex problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to cleanly separate the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the topics of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were struck and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for election law could only be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They decided to take action for women's election law, and the election law for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you will be aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the election law in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group developed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "finger" with the problems with which black women have seen apart since generations.
"Is it not great if the active women who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
Women of the second generation who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to preventive means now try to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another, but parallel reason for understanding an inhabitant of the body - and opinions on the race that are significantly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on racial topics in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far harmfuler than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their former criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently put a small program, My Brother's Keeper, on to help injurious young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is emerging in the front of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unmarried minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, the theme of immigration reform will also come back to the surface - this time as a woman's topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, a organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-view of the topic as a key topic of women, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"This speaks for itself," said Mercado.
When the large majority of working visas go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a postal hall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine house" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed from real estate makers, as it became evident that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The independent house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - among which a pig was also that his head had beded on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo has been mistakenly published and has now been removed," said a speaker of the company.
In the exhibition of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the maker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
In the social media, the house sales provided interest when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey hosts a new millionaire after lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a happy winner who receives almost 1,1 million dollars from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey for the second time in five years moved the jackpot in the drag of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profits provide conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city talks about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a win could take place.
Eight WA winners have celebrated profits in the first division last month, a proper completion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7,5 million just a few weeks earlier.
The victory couple had played for twenty years and said that profit allow them the possibility of a world trip and buying a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the gladiators were kneeling deep in Matsch on the first Rheinbacher Römer day in the recreational park.
But the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract far over 1,000 visitors yesterday who defeated the rain showers and the autumn cold and were relentlessly enthusiastic from the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of presentations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting troop from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust battle art in the area with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a more humorous and expert presentation and sent his men together into the ring to the heroic two-fighting in various gladiator gatherings.
First, the "provocators" were on the row with rectangular and short swords as well as bones on the left leg and arms on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and worm, as well as iron gladiator helmet, bone and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", which met with a garbage net, three-sack and doll against the "sector" and, after a short fight, hit the guys to the ground.
As the swords force each other metallically, the shields created and the cubes flood surrendely through the arena that a fear and anxiety could become for the health of gladiators.
However, the impressive "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had a always noticeable eye.
"We wanted to relive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Organizer "Friend Kreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Opidum Romanum" from the recreational park for a day, a Roman city, as vice-burger Claus Wehage found in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous constructions that we admire today.
Remnants of this were also excited on the Roman Day, such as "Aqueduct Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel Bridge, which was once at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once faced water and energy supply and now, and manager Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms Diplom-Measuring Engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "GenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, which presented the measurement instruments of the Romans, such as chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as tile stones from the original hypocauste, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Amazingly also the footprints that Wolf and Fuchs had left two millenniums ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Bodendenkmalpflege in Rheinland had buried the remains of a Roman villa in the commercial park Nord in Rheinbach.
It has found surrounding walls of a economic building with a thirst to dry cereals and to paint.
The building probably belonged to a villa of Rustica, a agricultural goods, explained Archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of findings from these excavations represented it in a glass vicine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a tight necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the then Roman Rheinland, suspects Morscheiser.
The children also engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tables as the Roman students once wrote.
At the stand of the Roman Therms Zülpich, the children were allowed to place Mosaics themselves at the stand of the Glass Museum Rheinbach Glassmosaiken and to use a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of Eifel Nettersheim at the stand of the Nature Center to male the flour for a flat bread or a müsli.
With the original Roman travel cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors went through the recreational park and came along the impressive position of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Rome Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the rheinland-wide Roman year 2014, which is supposed to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with home and history associations as well as the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered a lecture, a lecture, cooking evening as well as leaderships for school classes and a reminder of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman Legionary is told of his work on the Watchberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era, and offering a fun teaching in the field of international understanding between a group of waitbergs "Germans" and attractive Romans.
Adendorf's primary school is devoted to the Roman topic in the context of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous but frequently, but no longer on the first view, the Romans' visible traces in Wachtberg will be reexperienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will recall the foundation of the Berkumer Matronenheiligdom in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic stresses the West African economy
The Ebola Epidemia in West Africa is also a severe struggle for the economy.
Markets are inferior - and international companies go to distance.
The devastating Ebola Epidemics causes the economy of West Africa to be a severe stroke.
The harvest is rotten on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are legacy - the virus has been difficult to add to the region.
Also some international companies are already on distance.
"The Ebola Epidemia is not only a medical crisis but also a economic crisis," judges the Head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose very much money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital of Monrovia.
The market only comes who wants to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia was most severely affected by the virus, but here alone more than 600 people were victims of the fever.
Recently, health authorities stated that the disease was in every angle of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Over 1,500 people already died, and thousands of others attended.
Foreign companies distract employees
Overall in the resource-rich countries, companies expose their operations.
Foreign companies, such as the Arcelor Mittal steel company, refrain from their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the regions concerned.
Also the local dealers and farmers react: only a few buyers leave their homes to get a replacement.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantines, the important cookie and coffee beans are rotted on the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food is being scarce
"The people are going to get less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris's expert in Western Africa's economy.
For example, the man who usually goes on the market and sells his vegetables is rather home.
Therefore, the population gets to feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: foods are getting short.
On the markets, the stock of basic food such as rice disappears.
At the same time, the region strongly dependent on international companies threatens image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies in principle avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
It is decisive how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors can find the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also invest,” warns Hugon.
The disease also stresses the state budgets of the States
The disease also stresses the state budget of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be strongly tightened by the high expenditure for the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects may also be seen in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying home because of fear of an inflammation.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly backwards.
Guards celebrate her 50th anniversary
From 12 to 14 September, Berngau is a 50-year-old foundation feast.
On high tours, the Schützenverein Tannenwald prepares for the 50-year founding feast from 12 to 14 September.
It is planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, the big buffalo shooting is about 18.
Afterwards, in the large festival of the atmosphere evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbauam".
Blascapelles care for music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festival Service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great festival at 14 a.m.
The afternoon is also the price distribution of the Bundes- und Gauschußen.
A very beautiful view will be the 25 festival ladies with their dirndl.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The screen rule has taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Voracker.
The original name "Schutzgesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" originates in 1907, when the Association was founded on 21 March for "sociale entertainment through exercise in room support and small potassium shoots".
The NS regime had in 1937 led to the resolution of the association.
Only in 1964, 19 young men found themselves again who, on April 30, in the guest house of Luke, lifted the "new" Guards Association "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a protector through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a union location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Guards Association started in the guest house "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, now organized in seven crews, established themselves in all classes up to the first Gauliga.
The association records purzeled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached by Rudi Meier for the first time in 1980.
As the performance of active guards has increased, the numbers of members have also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" association site has no longer satisfied the claims of a modern Guards Association, the then board, led by Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future domicile in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Hardeis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988 practitioner Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shooting rooms.
One of the major highlights in the history of the United States was certainly the 44th Gauss Shooting, connected with the celebrity of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Guardian Association celebrated its 30-year anniversary.
In 1995 a boller group has been founded.
Joseph Schmalzl became Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerische Böller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of official work, the members of the United Nations have modernised the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them to the latest update of the technology.
Elf teams in round competitions
It can also be seen the sports performances of the Guardian Association.
A total of eleven teams are currently involved in the round competitions: six air gun crews, an air gun crew, a sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH crews.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in the round 2013/14 by Gauoberliga (the highest Liga in Schützengau ANB) to the district Liga 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga North to the Gauoberliga.
Besides the shooting sport, events such as bock sticks, fashing and king's balls, university trips and Christmas celebrations have tradition.
With this, the shooters are also at the festivals in parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the race route
Tony Stewart's return to the racing route was about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time, after his right front ripped in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now focuses on the race on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better operation and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can make it better there.
Stewart had already been running on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to make the right side of his car repair.
"I have entered with pretty good hopes for a good result today," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the sleepper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart let three NASCAR Sprint Cup races go after his car met and killed another driver at a ash racing race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation of the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had entered the railway during a race to face Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities notified that the investigations for the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks.
There has not yet been a decision on whether Stewart has to expect a accusation.
The three-time champion was received with great welcome when he was presented before the race.
After a start at the 12th position, Stewart was shortly afterwards in the first 10 and was temporarily on the fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs got
Vehicles with no. 18 excess control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart, with both cars driving towards the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Tanzfreudy Adults Searched
Just try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to contesting.
Like many other associations, the Jazz groups in TV Jahn also create the whole day lessons at the continuing schools.
After summer holidays, some groups have decimated very much.
Now it's searching for grown-ups for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Tree in the group of eight to twelve years, six in the group of twelve to 15 years," says the 20-year-old.
With more assets, it would make it much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
Those who want to dance can enter the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation in the training hours Thursdays between 17 and 18 p.m. or Fridays between 17 and 18.30 p.m. in the dance sports room.

Bulgarian prison overseers protest across the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organised a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for recovery of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher wages are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officials have symbolically protested against the new working hours and demand a return to the previous 24-hour layers.
Despite the meetings between the trade unions of prisoners and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the execution of penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov, informed the BNR.
The protest of prisoners is expected to be supported by members of the trade unions Association of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In the Eastern ukraine, the Prorussian fighters continue to march.
After heavy fights, where Russian tankbataillone was supposed to be involved, the Ukrainian army has abandoned the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk airport today, Monday.
The army also informed that in the past 24 hours seven soldiers have been killed.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the highest army leadership, without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot off plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists have once again shot off a fighting plane and two military hubs.
In addition, about 100 soldiers had been injured or killed in the Donezk region, the rebels informed Russian agencies on Monday.
Ships of Coast Guard
The opposers also claimed that for the first time in the Asovian Sea, two boats of the Ukrainian coastal guard had been lowered.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships had been shot on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border protectors were injured, a speaker in Kiev said to the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in Donezk area had been controlled.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group meets.
In addition to representatives of the Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a missionary of the Separatists from the Eastern Ukraine should participate.
In the preliminary field, all stakeholders used their performances for public disclosure of their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
The NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukrainian crisis.
The NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday, in Brussels, that NATO was in line with the 1997 NATO-Russian Council.
However, the NATO-Chef accused Russia of "a cracked fracture" of the agreement.
"Today we must see the reality in mind that Russia does not regard the NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Documents and comments from the Russian side suggest "that they view us as opponents".
Strengthened NATO precedency
Rasmussen has also announced that they want to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas conversations
Russia and Ukraine have agreed officially on new discussions to resolve their gas strife.
The negotiations will be held for the next Saturday, said the Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still awaiting a decision of the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the discussions.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has no longer received fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger has recently communicated between both sides.
The Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe relates about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, from which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Maut will come "although clear"
Now the Chancellor again confesses.
A free letter for all complicated details, however, is not.
Heavy concerns from the CDU against the car mout have grew up the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke, after persistent resistance from her CDU, a powerful word for the introduction of a car-maut.
"To say that she is in the coalition contract, and she will come," said the party manager on Monday after meetings of the CDU top bodies in Berlin.
But Merkel was not determined on a detailed model.
In the black-red government programme, "defined parameters" are called.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being continued to work on it.
However, the NRW CDU persists on its no to a wall right on all roads.
Merkel stressed that also Minister-in-Office Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructive in the discussions for a legislative draft.
In addition to the topic, he also spoke with Dobrindt about other possibilities to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband development.
"There's nothing special about it." Schüble had left a "Spiece" report uncommented on Sunday, his house checks his own concept to charge motorway investors with wall intakes - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned to develop a concept against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Contract never ended with the promotion of all circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU country chairman.
In that respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk about the subject again.
Opposition to the plans comes also from the CDU country associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
The background is anxiety that a torch affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded a series of CDU coalition loyalty because of the maut criticism.
The left views the plans as failed in view of the conflict in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said CEO Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabdrucker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a quantity obligation on all German streets to start in 2016.
Inland car owners, however, may not be charged additionally according to coalition contracts.
Therefore, they are to receive full compensation for the wall over the Kfz taxes.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorders often misdiagnosed
One British says she thought because of a misdiagnostic for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She was actually suffering from the Charcot-Marie tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside of the brain and back marrow.
Charity CMT UK announced that failure diagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as muscle weakness, insecurity and crumbed toes.
Diseases also suffer from deafness or pain. The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedrich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I always fell down and everything took longer.
I could never go with the other kids rolling or skateboard and was often in school to go for my kind and to walk.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 after several operations to discharge her Achilles sons and stretching her feet, she saw her medical documents when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and worried.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and then slowly lose all my abilities.
I made it all alone with me and planted my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17 years old, she realized that her abilities had not declined as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, or you'd be in a wheelchair now."
I think you have something far less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT-Awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the close of the former troop's workplace
For nearly ten years, there has been no shooting at the former troop place in Münsingen.
Yet, killing ammunition appears every month in the heart of the Swedish Alb biosphere area.
The granates are still at times so dangerous that they need to be exploded on site.
An ear-destructive knall is causing at the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell at Münsingen, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area has been the core part of the Sweebian Alb area, which is open on 13 roads for hikers and cyclists.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington is increasing with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax reports for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in Washington were no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase by 3.8 per cent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the previous year, and it was the third growth year following the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 per cent, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district tax revenue, 56 per cent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland’s income is from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax income from companies by 28 percent.
A large majority of the increase in tax revenues is founded in a recovery of the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say that this year, with growth rates of less than 1 per cent, resulted in an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the end seems to be the same for the Washington room.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase by 4.2 percent over a year.
However, the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes are nearly more than one fifth of the tax reports of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, manager of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies cannot only be calculated for the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate revenue also appears to be recovered, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in business income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local tax burden for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was considerably higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas of office, has the most significantly smallest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A comparable study of the U.S. Chamber of Trade at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower government and local company taxes are required and a better tax climate exists in total than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the next year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure whereby most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 per cent last year to 2.4 billion dollars, a significantly faster growth rate than total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in company taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in the general VAT income for the State and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be behind if the Federal Government's expenditure reduction affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hope and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
German beer, broken in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - so is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would sit down in our city," said the Vice Party Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Regering the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly returned to this concern of the Twelve-Million Metropole during the discussion.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, he won Li.
Therefore, people also owned the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German Political Delegation, admitted to the host that he will be in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and joy," he added at lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out to Mr. Li, and he smeared to the host.
Then the Guangzhou functionary came up with a shearer rubber - but with red wine, served for the dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao comes back to German brewery art.
Tsingtao-Bier is broken after the German purity command.
More trade
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
The Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012, for economic reasons, expired.
"It would reward again," the municipal politician proved convinced.
"Company between our two cities is increasing."
At present travelers had to take the way over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of the Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice governor of the Province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish first in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gumbel - the Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate scholar of Germany, agreed.
Maintenanced partnership
The vice-partei of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to attend Frankfurt to a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came to the office this year after his predecessor had been transported from the Office for corruption claims.
The local party manager Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is undergoed by Head Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functionary in Fujian, where the car builder VW built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers of Guangzhou is one of the two sides, such as a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The south-Chinese metropole on the perlfluss is almost as strong as the whole of the hessen with its economic power.
In the next year, she wants to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reports Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since she was in a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter today proved hopeless that the 81-year-old comic is recovering from her disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to heart rest at a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep them deliberately sedated and monitored until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "sirst".
The reactions came from many pages, even in the form of an overwhelming online support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and increasing wages
In the future, more strict environmental standards will be applied to cars and dust cleaners that come into trade from now on.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values are applicable in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the castlers: they receive a bundle of a single minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: The online single dealer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars (970 million US-$).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like selling Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion decision, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", said an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which Beserwisser gives the (mostly older) games a stroke of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken up a pity, a teaching book example of a established technological company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube wasn't able, as the company reported reports were ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, honestly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who declare that they prefer to drive sports rather than watching them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that depends on watching others when playing instead of even taking the control console in hand.
It's one thing to watch a friend over the shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she swallows through the resident Evil, and something very different to see a spinner in the way he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty in his head.
All these games you could look at right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without own control of the perspective.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our Electronic Age complete all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as a game or humor virus is not present, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money of it?
It is difficult to imagine that Twitch is integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could simply swallow.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are encamped as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of the gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a viewer sports.
At the Hüpfburg at the Burggarten Festival, there was a lot on Sunday night.
The concept of organisers was true.
Despite the strong rainguss on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans arrived at the Open Air Fest in the Burggarden.
Sometimes the entrance had to be stopped.
"This was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organisers.
Salt l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness by day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was shown early on Sunday night when the first visitors opened to the Open Air.
The organisers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supplies on the castle garden way, Salzwedelers, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings had been comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whipped with the foot in the roof, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were required.
And that across the generations.
While the one on the ceiling on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others laughed at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the grown up at the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction point for the smaller guests.
But also during child minking, volunteers had to do all hands full in the true sense of the word to become Lord to the Andrang and to magnify imaginative creations in the small faces.
The largers used the chickertics or participated in a Skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew set out of salmon.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m., he broke down on the visitors, especially families were looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "performance on the whole line".
That is why a repetition of the great party will not be contrary to the next year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked, Sem made it clear in a first balance on Sunday compared to the referendum.
He declared annoying that the introduction had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too few powers.
The result: Some who had already paid no more came to the site.
The resonance would have been very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler spoke of some 1200 visitors who were stumbling in the castle garden.
There were problems in sound technology.
The Salzzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox disappeared their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a half reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt for a tire panne.
"In the next year they'll be there," said the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air had more than succeeded by the visitors' numbers.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organisers have committed some mistakes that will have to be repealed for the first time but have to be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organisers have to sign criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you have just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event side.
"You have taken over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very tight.
I think it's very good that some people don't just talk stupidly, but they're also really trying to put something on their legs.
"Hold up!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organisers remain a year of time to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's sign shrinks
It is not expected to be so.
Rather, the part that is ready is waiting to be used in the striking construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: nearly 50 years after the creation of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called Radom, is fully renewed.
The new radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
But the size remains the world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cable exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken off with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather plays, the action should go through the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket Challenge is kicking up
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted as much as her ice-cry water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket Challenge went painfully downside.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she cut her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK circulated as much as her ice-called water was poured over her head that she injured her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw remained simple," she said to the Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't go, the jaw was cracked, and then I realized that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and almost made laughs in my pants, but I had to go to the emergency.
The 20-year-olds from UK were delivered to the hospital in order to re-inject the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs coming back to a strange?
In the last few years, there was a twist between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the dead Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in French Guidelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
The views of Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed to be very different.
Now the two camps are moving together: discussions should soon be held on a common approach.
This confirms the associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we be able to come together once," says Sjöberg.
He believes that all members of both associations will be able to move back to a strange future.
This is how you can see more visible successes.
While the castlefriends around the suddenly dead Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest, the castle association around Sjöberg is the "excavation and enthusiasm" of the area at the top.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfriend, has enjoyed its own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he represents the bourgeois friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
Currently, according to the 74-year-old, the association counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have left the association activities to rest from respect." This "think phase" would have been necessary to "what it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the bourgeois friends could also make a current mood image within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the Presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to announce himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to cooperate in the project "but very much wants to continue".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He deserves Dimbath as "Missionar", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not air locking.
By a high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to move the project forward." A "all-instelling feature" for the river city could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, Piffl believes that the project would be fundable by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors.
"The idea of rebuilding, therefore, I don't want to simply throw over board." He hopes that the Burgerverein may move something at this point.
Their goal of first documenting the history is "important and good".
After that, you could keep looking.
Clever ways to save in uni teaching books
Since the cost of uni teaching books for many students is more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever sparide.
He invented a loan system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the re-sale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college headquarters informed students to spend more than 1,200 dollars per year for teaching books and study materials, however, that there were various cost reduction options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
The rent of teaching books becomes more popular, and thus students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than buying.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university booklets, informed that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Inquiries in the industry show that about one quarter of the books in the college booklets were rented last spring semester, said Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus bookstores, according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one time for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler cost almost $290, but can be included in the specialized teaching book dealer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If one does not matter to the notes of other or normal traces of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenditure were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs for the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also an popular alternative to used books.
Rent
The rent of teaching books is worth considering if you treat them quite well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform you about the provisions of the shop where you rent, including the fees which may be charged for writing notes, underlines or traces of use.
Renter carefully: If you do not return the book, the fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-Books are also an option instead of traditional teaching books.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a specific period of dealers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Surely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will next visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price definition of books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before a online order, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is really precious.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a boxer
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars in his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only played 12 million dollars of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" circumcised on Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million at the opening week, while children's films such as "drinking tubs made easy" also disappoint the revenues.
A article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the children's films could be the cause of the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin referred to 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "drinking tubs made easy" as just "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, for films for a slightly older target group it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer film start that was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 walls.
The results are based on the views of film critics and films and suggest that this year's film heat is equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development of changing sight habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix is due to.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disneys' soon-representing jungle book film, said to Hollywood Reporter's website: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood production, Netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they focused too much on filming comics and prophesied a "Kernschmelze" Hollywoods.
In view of the current abolition, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could certainly contain a true core.
However, due to the potential casings that are expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The manufacturer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the kassa results as simply "cyclisch" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business."
A few years ago, when the second table tennis district class was deleted for the punishment of the Ligen division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Whoever has not risen has gone down.
Thus, Göttingen's highest class team has avoided the decline in the Oberliga relegation, but only five-class plays in the next season.
Four-class Torpedo ladies, despite their great doormarch, remain in the regional liga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weede.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo reserves enter into the new Association Liga, in the National Liga no longer represent gods clubs.
At the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo Second in the National Liga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Insect, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholensen, FC Weser and TTC enters.
In the District Liga, as regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC II, Red White, the upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district superiority of women begins at least in Skalstärke.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the district liga starts Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
With nine crews
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district liga.
The district liga of the SCW boys - there still starts torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded region association, the two Göttinger circles start with every nine crews.
The Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Green, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Lenglern II are located in the West Staffel.
In the East Staffel plays among other things Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemmern, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no women teams on the circular level.
It is noteworthy that none of the six second circuit classes will have to reach strength, here the innovative and exaggerated circuit board will have to think about.
Nato summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
In the weekend there were protests from opponents of the Nato Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people in the centre of Newport gathered to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall in order to hold a so - called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments for us in the weekend and spoke to demonstrations traveling from Bridged to Belgium.
A teenager fled from the Blue Mountains
TWEE youthful Buschlanders were put in safety with the seal winds after they had been caught over the night to the Blue Mountains in the NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheath to her tour.
Careful relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two were not returned home.
A local police and rescue service troop broke up and the couple was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had hurt her knee and the man was crashed and had kicked his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flewed out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in a stable condition with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Government enemy protests in Pakistan escalate
The about 1,000 demonstrations had been pushed from the PTV building, said Minister of Information Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter re-established the radiation after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured persons have not been reported.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Head of Government to which they propose election fraud.
The police informed me that about a mile from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was reconciled on Monday by some 3,000 protesters with security forces.
A police officer was injured after hospital reports.
At the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured when demonstrations tried to insist on Sharif’s residence.
They call for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict to "sustain time and use without violence".
In addition, the Communication said: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The escalating violence has been worried about a military intervention that has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by opposition policyer Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri last since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses a withdrawal.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to retire," said Khan.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won Parliament's election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri demands the withdrawal of central and province governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in operation to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had endured peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri invited them in the weekend to insist on Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory at place three of the table.
With the 2:0 on Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took an compatible end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who proclaimed three places with green white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to disappointment against Helsinki with a success experience into the country game break with the second season.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defendant Thomas Schrammel, who, with his glorious leader-volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, put the softs on victory.
"I thought I chose all the frustration from Thursday and sneaked it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had hit on 13 November 2010 for the last time in a federal party, it was still for Ried.
The first championship match in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in a special memory for him.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid-Nachwuchs," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term pool blessur of Mario Pavelic, scratched from the left to the right defensive side and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also be able to do this position in the wrong way.
The gate he deserved, he already made some assistants," said Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could also have signed.
"Thank God we have had a little luck today," also noted Schrammel, who thus pointed to the breakdown of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the gambling was always good compared to last year."
Barisic was even saying that "in many games had been better than today" - against "the strongest crew that played in this season in this stadium".
The first three point since July, therefore, has proved that the crew has been intact to the relapses, despite: "Today my crew has shown that it has character."
Not less exciting for him, "that we finally played again to zero."
A lot of work during the country game break Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger were to complain about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their startelfdebüts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," admonished Barisic, who lost the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which have been very stable in recent times."
Therefore, the country game break needs to be used to "slick wounds and to make a bit of a bit in the physical field," said Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in his rows.
One of those who thinks the break is specially located is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the crew, goes over pain.
Just during this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," observed Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't have to believe that everything is good now" "We have probably also had a little luck, but at some point luck has to come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He would be admonished to concentrate on work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we can't believe that it's all right now.
He couldn't dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young crew that I can help very much at the moment.
They're going to stick to me in some phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his crew.
He regretted the rapid contradiction "from the category of magic," as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which had been misrepresented by arbitrator colleagues.
The only assumption I can make to the crew is that in some phases we were not specific enough towards gates.
We had too few conclusions there.
Indoor defendant Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In general, more would have been in it.
Under this peak Ruh
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle series "My piece of Rhine luck" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the rural circle, the pictured exemplare is the "Gitruheiche" above the underweating brown.
A holpriger footway leads up to the about 600-year-old oak.
It passes groups, basalt stones and basal stone lakes.
A little bit below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it reaches beyond the other trees of the surroundings and reminds with a range of more than eight meters of an American mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mysterious place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bishopsheimer archive and asked older people from Underweißenbrunn to learn what family it has with the gießruheich.
The result of his research remained the rather necessitarian declaration for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds were supposed to have driven their animals from underweight well to the hardly roded and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards exhausted by the rise were supposed to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has recovered its importance, for on the grass sheep are actually weighing herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
When joining the stone collections, however, you should be careful, because the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place for cross-rotters.
A walking road leads from Underweißbrunn to the tree, but is somewhat hidden.
Further ways are outlined, rising upwards and inviting to a wide hiking.
Where's the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg, which is searched for in our next task, is rather rare to be found in the height.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the countryside that could fit the building conterfei.
Where is our "chopping of Rhine luck"?

After weekly divorce, Italy's Prime Minister and official EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, held the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of the EU's external policy last week, will be the successor of Britain Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the government-nearly newspaper La Repubblica represents the call for Mogherini's favourite in the government team as a strengthening of the position of social democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not at last, Renzi hopes to put calm on the left-handed party base again and again, because Mogherini is assigned to this - though rather in a moderate manner.
Contrary to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, nominated as the President of the Council, Donald Tusk, is the predominant opinion in Rome to make a political compensation.
For at the same time, the EU head diplomat becomes vice-president Juncker.
The remaining consent of the EU Parliament is deemed to be safe.
Otherwise, President-in-Office Giorgio Napolitano would not have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the governing Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that the Mogherini, known for her ambition, will grow to the "enormous challenges" for almost two decades.
The brotherly Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their party career began the promoviered polytology in 1996 in the Youth Organization of the Dawn Democracy di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined in 2008 with the Catholic Center Party Margherita to the current social democratic PD.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organization of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 in the Left Democrat Party Council, she entered the high party policy, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional highlights of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the social democrats in Europe and the democratics in the United States.
Since 2008 she has been a member of the Chamber of Defense and European and International Affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Minister for Foreign Affairs.
If the PD today has a better relationship to the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in May, then, as the PD requirements say, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
Consultations in Brussels, the new EU External Representative has too little diplomatic experience, so there is no substance in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic Members, Mogherini's mistrustful realistic accents are being followed and distorted as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian gas is to be transported directly to Southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi arrived as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first public visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake hands were taken up with angry in Brussels, as well as inviting the Kreml Chef for October to an e-mailing economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new staff will be active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedure mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Upper Weightach, Daniel sorg free and Sebastian Dentals from Pfrimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainers previously attended primary and middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainers of all the years as well as the trainers are traveling to a team training event to Oberammergau, including a whole day migration and rafting on the inside of the program.
The company counts 435 German and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainers distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep your mouth and bring France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important alliance.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "his love" for the controversial socialist presidents whose cabinet circumvention was found to be disapproved by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at great applause.
As a vital gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a reduction in the regulation of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economic Affairs.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellowsocialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
However, Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, struck sand into the drive, in which she came up at a meeting of a desirable socialist Member and criticized the Socialist party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the long-standing right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant funeral fights of socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would endure for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that it would appear as a victory in favour of elections and be ready for the government.
The Government Party of France suffered a decline in the Municipal elections in March, and the legally-oriented national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French believe that the socialist party is exposed to the risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of the term of office of Holland in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve improvements in the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, leads advanced negotiations, according to experts in the industry, to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion.
A deal would be Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous customer, while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
One agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the discussions could also end indefinitely.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Apollo Global Management LLC Private Equity Society (APO.N) also has a 20 percent share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker rejected a comment for Apollo.
The company located in Miami Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the East Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues were $2,57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operate under the trademark name Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cross-border ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue for 2013 of 1.2 billion dollars, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is totally $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to be strengthened by the middle class in threshold countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice with the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. Regulatory Authority in January 2014 to the stock exchange.
Apollo has been a major shareholder in the company since a deal of $850 million in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a fusion with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino mix group under the control of the Malaysic billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28% of the shares, Apollo 20% of the shares and TPG Capital LP a share of 8% in the company at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together, according to the original application documents for the stock exchange of Prestige Cruises, over 82 percent of passenger capacity in American cross-border ships.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day after the election.
A peking-trude group swinged the Chinese flag nearby.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates to govern Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the majority of support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking-trusted members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for oppositional democracies to be authorised to choose and will cause pro-democracy activists to meet their threat and to commit the Hong Kong financial site with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong, and the party leadership of China fears that the call for democracy is expanding to other cities.
After the publication of a Peking White Paper, which presented China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held a inofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a site in there.
Lis survey is organised by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Connecting Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-President of the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted in the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather themselves in the afternoon at the headquarters office in Hong Kong.
Britain did not see any democratic elements until the end of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin requires Kiev to take up "State Conversations" with the Eastern ukraine
The Russian President Wladimir Putin demanded Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government set up the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and directly negotiate the "state" of the apostate region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under the control of the separatists in the Eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia, but that its status to Ukraine must be re-defined to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiefer Government for negotiations at eye height with the Pro-Russian rebels fits to the strategy that he seems to follow since the excursions began five months ago: help for separatists in conquering areas and pressures on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossia to provide factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the State Television Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for reconquering the areas held by Separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had announced the Ukrainian Peninsula Krim on 18 March.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently referred to the consumed area as "Novorossija" or "New Russia", a term which reminds us of the pre-revolutionary glorious time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for elections on 26 October and during government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separatists hope to be "catched in their illusions", Itar Tass reported.
"We need to enter into detailed discussions immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of the society and the state status of the south-eastern ukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to state has to be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the chairman's leadership for months to disperse fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kreml speaker on the correction of the "failing interpretation" of Putin's comments underlined the Russian leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east in contrast with the direct annexation of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulties to announce the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the Eastern ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a wide majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine full power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus the Kremlin de facto give control over a area that associates the Russian state with the Crime.
The 5 months ago annexed island in the Black Sea is the home of the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trade port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and poetry, which produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, in his speech on the entry into force on 7 June, suggested that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additives to the Constitution with which the respective areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his imagination of autonomy seems to be in a sharp contrast to those of the Kreml and the separateist rebells whose arms and emerging Moscow are being imposed.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at the height of the eyes, followed after a further intrusion of the rebells last week, after Russian troops and tanks have moved into the Eastern Ukrainian Ocean along the former peaceful region.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the field, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, is the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to fix Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the island of Krim.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and urged for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We stand in front of a point where there is no more back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the Ukraine Territory.
The EU summit did not decide any specific actions; the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia to take effect in an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donetsk region last week to support the beared separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday with 10 Russian fallscreen hunters captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal for Australian Promis and Gabi Griko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no hole for his trouble about hackers, probably naked pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who stole the A Promis from Hollywood.
The film town is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking scandal for promis on the Internet.
The responsible hacker has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the tributs of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
By the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Gracco from Melbourne, it is said that private photos were also audienced due to a iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
Edelsten, who had engaged himself with Griko last month, said to Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reports according to a news site, said that the hack was "shameful" and that the subjects felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which it is located upstairs without a pool.
Palmers' films include "Liebe is indefect" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's a terrible injury to the privacy."
Schauspieler Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Hacked images from a mobile phone are nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
Purely legally, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radler, Jogger and Wanderers were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-sick children".
The tour, which was one torment, represented a light training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably had a good sleep last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberurseler Brauhaus drove with the wheel to the Feldberg yesterday.
For good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat, especially as the participation on the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg in favour of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) has brought him a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - great!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause basket?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament, many of the 718 participants mourned mountains yesterday in the early desk and came close to the exhaust, but happy on the plateau.
Others, however, found it easier to overcome the 11 - mile - long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the circuit day - red dress, red bike - made something on understatement at the start ("Every quantity of professionals, there's the target!"), then proved to be half a professional at the mountain and went through the target after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a rod, as also Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had made himself on the way together with Frank Green Iron.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily an athletic challenge: "This is about Charity, there we are happy to join - we would have made an exit anyway today", says Kuhn.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) was driven down to Oberursel in the morning, so that he could return to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swinged home at 9 o'clock in the seat in the morning, "made" the Feldberg two times to roll home with fun.
Fun also had "Fried Toni".
For the chief of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours are simply included over the Feldberg.
He had peeped 40 minutes with his 6,5-kilo wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "a ambitioned racer".
He must be too, because he was on the "fixie wheel", but they're also racing wheels, but without switching...
The fact that it also went easy up without cycling, not only the 20 hikers who rose up to the summit over the white wall and the footstand, but also a jogger, who pulled a car ripped with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwagt-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, provided security, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special slide train, just that he stops the sleeves." So the man is quite his own slide dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never - had been sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers released.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln on den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip.
Next year he hopes that the route to Feldberg will be locked up to the security of the participants.
