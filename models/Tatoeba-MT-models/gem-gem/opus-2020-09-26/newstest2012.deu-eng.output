No liberating Novelle for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to eliminate the paragraphs on which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned.
The new regulation, which could have led to the way of exemption from the Prisoned Minister, rejected the Members in the second reading of the application for the reduction of penalties for economic delicates.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison for the conclusion of a supposedly disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas in October.
The judgment is not yet legal, it is intended to negotiate the appeal of the condemned persons before the court in December.
Timoshenko itself describes the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the west, the trial gave rise to the suspicion of the prejudice to the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister of Extremity was condemned from the criminal law, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan Liberation Battle or Libyan Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual this region wins in the Islamist elections, the question is only what - the tempered or the radical.
The National Transition Council confessed to the usual law of the Sharī
Libya would go to the country without criminality, because for theft, you're shortly hacking off your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, execute any apostates of faith, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Coran in the future from each other.
In short - in Libya, a order will rule which would be hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively viewed either the best and would hardly fit the Libyans mentioned.
It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help themselves by the unbelieving dogs at all.
To apologize, it may only serve the fact that the NATO's air attacks were not led by any general from America, but by God himself, whose all power was praised after every successful meeting.
The winners in Libya?
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians disappeared in the person of the dictator of a political alliance, without any advantage.
According to the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from a military occupation of Libya.
This is why the hies are anxiety - namely the deployment of the cruisers.
But the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupiement?
It is hard to say that the West can eventually rejoice with the right of its unselfishness in the protection of human rights.
If this does not ruin the Sharīa representatives.
Starting a new crisis age
France and the rest of Europe focused on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm depth broke through Europe.
The individual states published their information on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the prequartal, Germany and France.
But today, the bond market breaks all records.
Investors are not only in Greece, but now also in Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
It is expected that the GDP of Germany grew by 0.5%, from France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected ( growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slightly decrease by 0.1% (only original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
Compared to the prequartal, however, the gross domestic product and, according to Tch, the Statistical Office confirmed the trend of growth delay in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analytical forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but compared to the previous quarter, it stagnated.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally over-saisonal data.
In the whole euro area and in the EU, between July and September, the economy had a growth of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, consistent with the analytist expectations.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The yield from its 10-year-old state bonds was the value of 28.45%.
The yield of Italian and Spanish government bonds increased up to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also begin to feel problems...
The yield for Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany, the ECB is supposed to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czech Republic qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualifications for 200 million
The football selection has taken the most difficult task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-designed Torwart Čech and a glorious gate of Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of happiness, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious predicament from the home game and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half time and a giant portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also conquered quite happy 1:0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and thus resolved their ticket for the football EM.
Also, because of the precise defence game of the Czech teams, they put more pressure on the Montegriners in the second half.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant chances.
Thanks to a excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also join the European Championships next year, and it is also rejoicing that the home football will be a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes, a fairly featuring football was played.
Both teams combined long-termly, and so was played mainly around the centre line.
In the second half time, the pressure of home crews remained out, and the wide declines in front of the penalty room were successfully rejected by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the Irish Isfahan University formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, in which uranium is processed on Tuesday.
They wanted to announce that they were willing to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently found in its report that Iran seemed to have abandoned all its efforts for a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to the complex in the afternoon before the entrance and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack intentionally to lay the Iranian nuclear programme largely lame, the Israeli press from the centre of Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment system in Natan's target.
The food card of a fat child: It doesn't dinner and eats for evening bread Wurst
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys - Adipous children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the environment is for the healthy development of a person, where he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipöse children, worts are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had in the morning the information action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence" pommes for evening bread.
In families with Dickerchen, sports is not exactly one of the favorite jobs, but the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Investigation among 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, whereby nearly 900 primary school children were consulted throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the Action "Adipositas is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Hospital and the Unilever Society.
To date, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the horrorly growing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children in question, for example, led five times a day to eat breakfast-second breakfast-food-food-food-food - one of the main requirements for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worst for evening bread
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families have breakfast.
And, in most families, each one's breakfast for himself.
The worst was the finding that is not at all frozen in every tenth family.
The breakfast is considered as the foundation of healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey showed that in the families of overweight children, more often unhealthy pommes were consumed.
And almost everyone - without consideration for weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children in question sports, only less than half of their parents do that - namely only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), composing their own food plan from offered possibilities to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far away from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite meals were many meal foods, meat dishes, and, of course, sweet foods.
"Alarmating is, above all, the great popularity of sweet limonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
During lunch, i.e. the main court, poultry was defeated nearly in front of poultry.
The chicken fruits almost did not like the children and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches were very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are very willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of surveyers who were filled with the questionnaire after the conclusion of the informing lecture "Adipositas is not a coincidence", a significant shift of preferences to principles of healthy diet was in many cases indicated in the results of the project.
Evidently, this was the priority of the sweet limos, where many children began to give ordinary water.
The children also crossed many frequent poultry or fish in the questionnaire as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less knots or sweet food.
Profis claiming - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how Stylists learn, I had a little mixed that it was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what else was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how the "in the place" goes.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer to the test, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully established.
This time we discussed with director Alena (in course no single man is participating), how to draw on a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's the most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other one too young figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of the stylist to throw wide shoulders optically, extend the neck or make up the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to dress a female type like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with large buses, broad hips and smal tailles - beautiful and figurative insane, without being too provokative.
For example, if the difference between valley and hips is so large that the rock or the pants really do not fit, you should be cut at least one piece by measure.
I'm sure you're not going to regret that, because well-seated clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a customized rock, you feel much better than in one of the bars, who always runs up and down, and so on.
Young figures can again allow to wear clothing with folds, trousers, applications, sticking or raving.
With this quantity of information and figure types, I am glad I have a whole week of time to get everything thoroughly through my head.
And yet, I'm afraid it's almost not possible in view of the commissioned housework.
Each of the attendees was assigned a promi for which she was supposed to imagine appropriate outfits - day clothing and evening robes.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "catch Miranda Kerr" that you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (now well, this is a little exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothes out of magazines or search, print, and then graphically edit them.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our entire personal style and our relationship to graphical design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the style.
The styleist dresses the models not only physically, but also forms the so-called product page in the journals (in accordance with specific standards, such as trend handbags, malls, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us about this.
But it's only on Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was immediately made by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And qualified stylist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The magic word means variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, such as a T-shirt or a coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, wear shoes to it and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to scratch the herbs or the crowns up and the whole look looks quite different.
"Game with it," he stressed.
But most of it came to me the following advice: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then you can hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I realize why we need to pauk all these teachings, what can be combined with something and why, even if you often get to see different things in fashion reports.
To be silent from fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So with all this, you have to expect in the design of the outfits.
That the image and style sometimes make half of the success, that also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
There you only need to see Madonna, a not just brilliant singer, made from the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, you are rather reserved for the services of a stylist.
Also familiar personalities often think this is wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is two-range).
And if someone of us gets to style, we should expect that he or she will likely force us a very different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to see with certainty that the boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has taken back or down, etc.
Jan and Mario stressed us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on the fashion and then "construct" outfit.
In his work, he has to communicate with the people he styles and he must be a violent psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering themselves and standing against his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her garments and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can't wipe out her all the cabin and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can carry," says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So that's a bag that you're knocking on the valley and in which you're wearing all the necessary proprietes.
Except such clear things, such as scissors, scissors for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such outensiles as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or guards), special clips with which the clothing is taken behind, if it is too large (tracks or other bracelets are forbidden to break the fabric) and of course nuts.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to undercover shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the atelier where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe chair, silence the outside.
And we sticked and we...
You can't even touch the shoes with the scissors so that you don't hurt them.
So you really have to do good.
Mario enjoyed me by commending my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me now - devoting to style at professional level is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride will be completely avoidable by a series of dilettant errors in routine travel to the spring.
Though it was possible to fulfill the ambitions largely, what is useful if no one apparently wanted to do a little more.
Already before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move a piece back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he seemed not to be just one of many action race games.
We were also curious about how the passage of the main protagonist rises out of the car and goes on foot.
But how to get used to NFS is much different in the end than you had expected.
Surely - potentially there are quite pleasant arcade races, but overall the game is mixed by some overflowing errors that are present in this series for a few years.
So it's actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of inconsistent silence of the player developers.
The adventure starts very well.
The first time you are introduced into history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal competition across America.
In San Francisco, so on the western coast, you sit on the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a wide range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that each stage takes place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You have no moment the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at this, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed the level of the previous parts of the series.
So no world movement.
But the journey through the desert, through autumn landscape or up top through deeply cut landscape seems very pleasant.
From time to time, untypical elements bring a little variation into each race.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that strongly limits the view.
In the mountains again, you have to be careful that you are not thrown off by a lawine.
In addition, the individual races are built quite well together.
It's just a few, but they're enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the required number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time (classical race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duel with a single contradictor.
And there's still the police that wants to mess with you.
A new thing is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is rather about some interactive animations in which Jack escapes from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right time.
So nothing complicated.
It is, however, surprised that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (conclusively only three).
Finally, this is more advantageous, because this element has at least no chance to become boring - it belongs to the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model rises in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's perspective, it does not rip out trees, but it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Anyone looking for realistic simulations needs to look around elsewhere.
However, an action-loaded race will continue to be very well justified, although it is possible to find better in competition.
Until then, everything's in the best order.
Real problems appear only after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
A game of this kind is hardly expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you do not have practically any arrogance on any object knowing how the car is behaving, then obviously it's not all okay.
Typical example: When you are tightly picking up or prefixing cars, you "strip" the other car in some places, but in other, nearly identical situations, you get into the sludge and turn wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car immediately to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't matter any further, it's all the time from annoying.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
If you've exhausted them, everything's going on from the front.
So the restarts are rather a tool, if something fails, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, but there is nothing else than learning the critical section out of the head.
Except unpleasant is that the same things often happen to the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit through.
Otherwise, you always meet "civile" cars in the appropriate place in the same configuration, whether as the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the contrary passes in front of one playing to two cars that come up, but until you arrive yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The contradictors have further benefits.
In all the game there are a few places where you are always overturned by the same opponent and also here again without considering the time.
At the most crazy, this is for the end of the game on the long bridge that is happening in opposite direction.
The counterpart must obviously get a man here out of here to the devil.
And if he's before one, he'll naturally take a look, so you'll start driving your own car a few times in a chunk.
Sure - you want to make the game just more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And this is sad, because despite a simpler model, the game is quite entertaining and in a position also so loaded for action that you almost no longer know where one of the heads is.
And in principle no matter what "debt" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boring can arise, or something very different...
An unusual idea is also the change of cars during the race.
You must not overlook the tank stations on the route, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car that you have just is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super cars for technical rides, for example on the serpents in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task-mode ( challenges) - so the races in the individual locations that you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for their own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (experiments) and the history.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: starting from car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is combined with the online function Autolog, which includes comparing its own achieved results with those other players and also providing other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
Because here you come with the car into a subway tunnel (meetway), where you rush long on the rails in darkness (meetway).
The tacho looks at numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (meanway), but at once a subway comes from the back and drives a compromiseless railway.
In our editorial, we'll probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical page is not surprising but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
Even more annoying is that at some exciting moments, the repeat rate slows down and this sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns accidents with a larger number of stakeholders, where you do not benefit from a continuous FPS anyway.
The sound playback is so far as O.K. and the sound track is taste.
In the effort to address a wide and possible scale rather young audience, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone" was created - but who buys a game like this for music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game would not be mixed by the totally unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have claimed with the breasttone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But this is how the game seems to be incomplete.
A class of pleasure for yourself, but you should be prepared to make these mistakes with the power of airport carriers in your eyes.

EU Messenger Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has brought the balance between the individual institutions emotionally out of the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn out."
"It will take five or six years until the waves are smoothed and all get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech Ambassador of the European Union, began quite sharply her lecture at the Legal Faculty.
The seriousness of taking the motto "For understandable and open about Europe" she has shown in the first part of her lecture, in which it managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a overlookable and understandable way that it could have envyed it by a number of directors of the Karlsuniversity Legal Faculty.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning, criticism became loud that he was too unuppressive - a gray official who had not grown such a role, but I must say it has been breathing to everyone how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a man who is able to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States, communicate with them, and who, above all, has clear ideas of how it should go on with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained her as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step to harmonise and improve the readability of EU policy to countries, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil maid Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated herself to the agenda under which the European Union lived and is planning to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago referred to it as a success.
The Czech Republic would have suffered from the financial crisis and gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the Presidency referred to it as a great negative that has seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of hands.
In the words of the Ambassador, it was quite hectic not only at the Presidency but also in the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, so far.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
Whether it becomes a narrow and spare budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and which are less supported - all of this is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also reminds her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "For understandable about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are terrible shortcuts, foreign words and special jargons that no one understands.
How should I, as a citizen, know whether you really want to curve or round turkeys in Brussels and discover various large bananas or whether someone really wants to forbid us the quarrels?
It would also like to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Messenger, the Czech Republic is calling to be a European shipping man who is more aware of the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czech Republic in European institutions is much more annoying.
Many factors are guilty of this, among other things, the refusal of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also emphasized the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, whose V4.
"When a pole or Hungarian comes to me and there is a Slovakia nearby, then the French next to me says: "Hey, what are you doing together the heads - is it your V4 again?" and thereby making a pretty acid mye.
Mrs Vicenové says that the EU expects, in the future, strong rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European Federation" it considers the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries beyond the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries that want to cooperate and those who do not want to stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more of such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcement of the principle, according to which all topics need to be discussed with an impact on the whole EU by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM enters the second century of his existence
If you wanted to look for a proper word that the IBM strategy is most precisely characterised, this would probably be the word "long-term".
For the broad public, IBM is the synonym of technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has already passed a century since its foundation.
The basis for this longevity already laid her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
He already represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think" became a mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company internal magazine that was released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture that was thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful to his principles and did not fear from changing everything else around.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society through the course of our first century.
We hope that we will achieve more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from the occasion of the anniversary.
Thinked System
Watson operated in the thirty years of social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Başa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a thoughtful remuneration system for best newer and merchants.
Similarly, IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are also cleared.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM raised any discrimination - and was able to choose it accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is switched at the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been part of IBM for thirty years and has taken the position of the head of vehicles, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM makes so-called online brainstormings, from which many future strategies and innovations are growing.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company is almost half a million people busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Their incredible position in the business guarantees a strong image to the company and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology business," said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference only to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo because of the family called "Big Blue", has grown into one of the world's largest companies in one century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product width - from servers to nano technology.
IBM has most patents from all American technology companies and five of his employees have been awarded with the nobel price.
Among the most well-known inventions, such as banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, string code or the floppy.
With about $220 billion stock exchange value (market capitalisation) this year, IBM was the second largest technology company (equal to Apple), and it has for the first time been overtaking Microsoft since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all products and innovations met the taste of the customers from today - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you can't get emotionally linked to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its basic walls on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
In contrast to the counterplayer Microsoft, who in principle stands and falls with his operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
In IBM's gains, services, software and hardware are largely involved in one fifth each.
In 1990 hardware was still the strongest represented with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low profits of assets at the value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchasing of future technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the current financial crisis for the first time featured like a storm around the world.
Also here IBM remained faithful to his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investments in the middle of the great world economy crisis.
Until now, it seems that the company IBM is overcoming today's crisis without any damage.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the recycling of the company has grown continuously.
The business log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
It is therefore also possible to expect that this flexible giant will also overcome the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to world flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded a hundred years ago in New York had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took over it only in 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a establishment in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later company IBM placed the merger of four companies, whose history is back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They had technologies, such as the famous stack card nutrients to register the start and end of the work.
Charles Ranlett Flint was the architect of this new company, who was also chaired in the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the manager of the company Thomas J. Watson to help him govern the company.
This Leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas, so far, the inconquerable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name already revealed, with the manufacture and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutters, to boxes.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its turnover to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat in the headquarters for 40 years, until then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers helped by IBM of NASA flights to the All - to the Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
In the meantime IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC, which sets the computer standard of that time, came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it purchased the consultant part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and thus fully entered in the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been paying out IBM in the last three years is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It represents the intention to use technology wisely in even planned areas, e.g. to improve the traffic and urban administration situation.
In the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the platform "Smarter Commerce" to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM established a establishment in Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a top research team of world level that deals with the Voice Detection technology.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husbands:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is the end!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) had become her lover from Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosarot dream and come home.
But now it's finally over with patience and for the further life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Richtářová, singer I. Bartošová, had offered refuge in her own house, she would not even have come into her dream as with her husband.
When Iveta went back and back after 30 days, Joseph went with her.
Yes, he even publicly confessed that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the course pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out."
"In fact, not as a loved, misled ass, but as a human to whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová told; she also said she had already emotionally separated from him and confessed only on mutual decentness.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him has brought Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, there's nothing to do with it."
"My wife wants a paper egg and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the land, I'm making the purchase."
"I talk with Darina normally, just the bed we don't share," said J. Rychtář (the leave) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop her from it.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize that's my fault, I've been in love with Iveta and therefore I'm taking on every responsibility.
The worst female disobedients: what about you?
If you invite the men to call some typical female inconvenients, they will shock some immediately from the herd.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines in which we let a few unset revue pass again that let the men wall the blood in the veins?
Purchasing
Does their husband pretend to be shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hater weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more for actions?
Then it's probably a weakness in your case.
Some women are aware of this, at least trying to keep their purchasing desires under control halfway.
But the hand on the heart, which woman is standing out, in search of a well-seated upper clothing only by a clothing shop and not trying to try all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Why don't you think how many times they told her husband? You'd rather stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
"I had to take off at least five kilos - should I start to jogg or make gymnastics?"
"I like you anyway?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yeah?
Then you'll be among the women who are quite obsessed with how they look.
That means not to let you go, but many men react allergicly when her wife constantly cares about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly intolerant.
Order and cleanliness at first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Wash windows, wipe tiles and dust, scream the basket - and this at least twice a week.
Squeeze with her partner because he tramples again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you swallowed the kids because the just screwed washbasin is dirty again and because the glass door at the living room closet has fingerprints again, where polishing makes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", you should know that nothing can be exaggerated and that the order and cleanliness in family life is not the first place.
This moderate purity fume can eventually damage mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Sticks
"Sweet turning pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't wonder that this brings him to the palm.
Of course, this is not badly meant, but they just want all that has his order.
If the men know this, then the women may not have had so much to mecker.
Knocking and Trash
Some women are clapping and joking, there are twisted behind the back or even blasphemed, or you make bonds.
Women are now focused on relations, so they are happy to interfere with such topics as - who, who, who, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a little harmless cock and crack in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably every woman's own.
But this is not to be confused with the biggest calibers, who are nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which, in particular, represent a significant danger for women's collectives.
Jagr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The ice-socket tower Jaromír Jágr had a major share of the 5-3- victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus the most productive Czech player in the NHL during the Monday game.
In both cases, users of the overview of the 19th-year-old Eishockey Star were Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called to the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jagr's fellow player Jakub Voráček.
Jagr claimed after the game journalists that he had a big evening prophesying for Giroux.
"Sonly before the game, I tell him that a hattrick succeeded him today."
I felt that somehow."
"Here and again comes such a feeling," Jagr explained, after whose action Giroux reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráček struggled behind the gate of the Hurricanes the Puck and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer achieved a short hander, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr, he reached his third meeting, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he is the best player in the Liga, but certainly he belongs to the best three," deserved Jagr his center.
"I wouldn't have come into my life to play with such an ice hockey player as with him to finish my career."
"I'm very happy."
"I cut my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now the spear turns around," smelted Jagr.
Carolina made the game to a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who went out of a penalty shot, came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in a large number two against one successful.
"Excellent hungers still acted in our zone."
"He picked up the Puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to more remote peppers."
"I tried to meet him, and I'm glad it worked," prescribed Voráček the last match of the party from his perspective.
Through this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defense player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and ended in the second third because of an injury at the upper body.
The Candiens also bought their leadership in the Penalty Shooting 2:3 next to their experience.
One of the penalty shots couldn't transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the trainer of home crew must have pained the high disease-related deficiency in the defensive - the game they only played with five defence players.
"That's bad."
"The meeting we only played with one single experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do with this," said Jacques Martin.
"With every change, one wave of attacks after another, and we had nothing to contradict."
"We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves," said P. K. Subban, one of the defendants.
The Czech gatekeeper Ondřej Pavelec defended thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed so significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, which finished a series of five defeats, five different shooters had a share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five government travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies sold only travel to the socialist Eastern Block countries at the time, where west was only allowed to choose.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic – the DDR), to the Societies (Shierland Krim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary on the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a pro-west course, and therefore the travels to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that even citizens of the Eastern Block (also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual journeys were not possible.
The travel offices also offered travel to the west, but then they had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleep bag in front of the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
The matter hadn't been like this for a long time.
The so-called devisen commitment - the condition for a trip to the West - was only granted "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to use the necessary funds (Western Currency) for a journey to the West.
Thus, most of the Czechs spent their vacation in the country, no wonder the Czechs bought numerous weekend houses and dates - a habit that lasts until today.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czech Republic.
While a holiday in the DDR or Bulgaria was the scale of all things by 1989, the Czech Republic spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that it was not possible to travel to the most popular country of the Czech Republic at all by 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the past century, the devisen obligation was suspended to the neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short visits mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could simply not get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech vacationers slept in the park on travel to Paris, because who had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of foreign trips from Czechs was then a full-packed bagroom with preserves, beer and dust.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to purchase the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thereby also the average salaries increased, which in 1997 was a further important moment.
Thanks to increased demands for travel, the travel agencies began regularly to prepare travel by charter flights after 1997, making flights, thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts, incredibly acceptable compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czech Republic, except the United States, had already free payment traffic with all the high-developed countries in the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-communications" travel was made in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed - to Thailand, thanks to the high demand.
Since then, every year, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been flying in far-distance sunny countries; in this year they are directed from Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch, which marked our "postrevolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17th, 2008, the United States took up the visa obligation for Czech tourists, so our country definitely entered into the high-developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs first spent more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head for a single holiday stay, including the costs at the vacation site.
The main meeting is to find a new chairman - again threatens a pat.
For almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no consensus on the rule of election.
Without this, no vote on the three potential followers is possible.
Three interested people want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June, Hašek resigned from his function, inviting his colleagues to find himself to a few and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old crossings between the two companion chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly shown on 16 September when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the people's house in Prague, Smíchov, for the negotiation did not result, and it was not only about the choice itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who is actually eligible for the full collection - only the statutory representatives or the functionaries equipped with a full power.
In this only point, at least partial agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose views of representation on a full-mighty basis were not placed.
However, the disputes about the rule of election continue to last.
The Executive Committee also no longer brought clarity to the matter at its meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the opinions concerning the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how should you take the third round to avoid a pat situation?
"The issue concerns the question whether to take action in accordance with the statute or whether to find a very different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in the management.
According to a set-up model, in the third round, the candidate, who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he candidates.
Mähren is supposedly prepared to agree with the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech page, on the other hand, requires that the winner receives at least one second-third-majority at this percentage of vote.
"Then the two front rounds don't have any sense anymore, this mode would question the entire two-room concept," Soboda understands the objections of the Marriac side, which would best be able not to add the rule of election, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclik also agrees, even if it is noted that the statutory voting order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is to be elected largely after the statute."
"So that no stupid replacement variants are designed, as in the last main meeting," explained the owner (the football club) Victoria Plze
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM today would certainly contribute to the reassurance of the comforts."
"If the football is riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec functionary, who brings the greatest experience from all three adapters and this at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl's still there.
"I hope to have an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately twisted."
"This isn't a matter between the people of bohemes and marrows, but there are some efforts to "reprove" the rules for their own purposes."
"Therefore a new blocking is not excluded in the main meeting."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind will ultimately win," said Rajchl.
Just - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete to the qualification game at all.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in Prague in the morning due to a technical disturbance, so they were looking fevery for a replacement variant, as to bring a part of the Executive Committee to the exhibition site of the Barrage Hinspiel.
Finally, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday, must be decisive.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister for Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the largest sports association of the country to an agreement.
There is a lot on the spell: government funds, the confidentiality of the Czech football and also the upcoming main meeting of the ČSTV, which is intended to guide the Czech sports towards the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík is in the fight about the position of the chairman because he does not see any suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclik, the chief of Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary General Assembly, could have been a strong candidate who had fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have taken part in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good adversary, I would fight for him and abstain from the choice."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclik ČTK.
So the main reason for Paclik to go to the Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the claimed favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the case of his victory, he intends to exercise the chairman's function only one year, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see a experienced top manager who is not too much involved in football events.
"I have spoken to some people who are in question personally."
"Caum to believe that some told me they were not currently trying to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"These views would have changed," he pointed out.
Most of all Paclik claims to disturb Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation which is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegated votes on the main meetings.
For Paclik it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta had the position of the chairman.
"With his victory, today's state would be preserved, and in the Czech football it wasn't going forward at all."
"The support of Berbr, a smart businessman, would get the football twice bad," stressed Paclik.
He also pointed to the fact that Pelta's name fell a while ago in connection with telephone hearings for detection in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta was a punishment.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta should bring to the football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclik, who had previously said, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta becomes chairman," but he sees a little more lazy.
However, if Paclik wins in the Thursday election, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclik before the main meeting in October, ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great capabilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he is able to lead the association as manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclik, who in September had made sure that he was replacing the arbitration of the arbitration commission with Luěk Macela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik himself claims that he feels the role of the Chairman of the Association.
And calls on his capabilities in the management of private companies, he has been chief of Pilsen last summer, who, with his support in May, celebrated the first triumph in the Liga.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence discipline and vocational commissions, which are disadvantaged up to opposed situations," said Paclik, who does not make a hole from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta Chef Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he considers the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would help the political top politicians to lobby more money from the lottery tax flow into sports.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new chairman should devote."
"If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
Its connection to Pilsner Club does not also consider Paclik to be disabled, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "transparent".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not exactly ideal."
"I don't think it makes much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party to return after six and a half years," Paclik explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will launch a Patt Situation in future.
Two days before the main meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman's Office, Miroslav Pelta, promised that he, in the event of his choice, will become strong for the FAČR to receive a new statute that will exclude disputes about the rule of election in the future.
The functionary of Jablonec is confident before Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the electoral campaign will safely dissolve in the event of a success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to focus on the national team and the gain of financial resources in the event of his choice.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting and thus the two-month break helped him to defend his ideas about the leadership of the football and present in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is led by someone, says the man who is mainly connected with the Jablonecer club, but who also acted for many years with Sparta and the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the Euphoria, which ruled at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, statutes were approved at the main meeting in June which were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we had already had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
Just the revision of the main document of the Civil Association, he used as a lock for the delegates.
"If I should be chairman, then I personally accept it and am ready to carry personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a principle without which he can't be," claims Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to distinguish himself from his counterparts.
He had already announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognized because of his legal education and he knows well that his counter-advertent was his first alternate.
Tomáš Paclik has not been attacking for a long time, and he has not left any dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"But his attacks were depressing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"So many now doubt his real character," addressed Pelta his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
He believes that his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower play classes to the national team.
And this should be the Czech football shield.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the postal halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"Just afterwards I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the sixty-five-year candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the content of all the employees," he said to Strahov, where the long anarchy is evidently nervous.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios accompanied by the upcoming main meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for free on Thursday.
"If really the only controversial point should be how to choose in the third round, then we'll get away from it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard among him
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected at the main meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association, this would be said to mislead many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that you will start working hard in the case of your choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that was started by the former president Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to devote myself to the football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, up to performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football moves forward in every segment with miles."
Many of them would not just be delighted because they, instead of just criticizing the work of others, had to begin working hard for themselves," he added.
As a result of the critical atmosphere in football movement, it has been considered not to apply any more.
"I know that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, who do not unavoidably throw knobs between my legs and question every step I'm taking," he said as an explanation why he has he has heeded.
"But many people told me I couldn't give up because other people would do it."
"That's trust that you can't play," he said.
He also claims to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great piece of work, and I don't want to just throw it away."
"There were processes started which would only be valid in a few years, and I would not want to see her stop someone," he said, and hereby expressing his concerns that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"There are mainly people who would make the football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I'm sure you're able to put something on me, but not that I'm partial."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it's all right and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl observed.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best for marrying."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not divide the league into a Czech and a mahric part, whose winners then went up to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three mahric clubs play in the Liga, which is especially a problem for the young players in Marern," says Rajchl.
Because the chief of the Pilsner Club Tomáš Paclik has joined the fight for the chairman's function, Rajchl does not trust to assess his chances of choosing him.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to be its vice-president and now recognizes that clear success is behind me," Rajchl, which also considers the saving of twenty million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of the fact that the association does not move to a single strong.
While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified from the beginning to help the Czech football to new trust," he thinks the second rivals - Paclik is a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done in Pilsen in only one year excellent work."
"If he would be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personal occupation in the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He would surely not want to devote things to his favor," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Blow into blue
By Julia Stanek
Plant pools in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hiking rest the tired legs in sprout baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on research trip in the past one and a half years, one was not allowed to be missing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Returning on the water, she looked high in artificially shaped couples, she swam marble puts that were waiting for them on the side of the ceiling, and astonished over acribic restored youth style swimming halls.
If she felt a bath, she took it up in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her just published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmenhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she led her journey to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe: Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sport she hasn't much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
Distressed only that swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chloor tanks, while jogger can breathe the devastating fragrance of forests or listen to a joyful bird wizard in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools should always be so horrible," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful bathrooms."
Water surface doubled architecture
Plates in the sprong and etheric sauna oil - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are used, so Meder.
And if the builders have struggled, swimming halls can be a true eye-smooth: "You have a water surface in baths."
"She is transparent on the one hand, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optical: high wool, colored tiles, jump boards.
The small-formated video "Badefreuden" mediated on 190 pages of knowledge of the architecture and culture history of historical wellness oases - but above all makes desire to a jump into the blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate water in an ancient carst cave (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose basin is filled with alkalic water and is located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termalfürdö in Jászberény).
However, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the entire city in the eye from the Zuricher Dachbad, you can look at the snowbed Arlberg in St. Anton in the outdoor pool - and: In the steam pool there is a window from which you can watch driving on the ski piste.
The most extraordinary pool design may expect bathing in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
From three upward open shells it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Eastern Valley rise to heaven.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector climbed Meder of the smell of Chlor into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell by sulphur, in the Árpád Bath in Hungarian Békescsaba, it stinks so strongly of heat oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health pool.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate healing water that is almost black and its slice sticks you on the skin as soon as you can slide into the pool - a wellness experience of the special type.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed in 1902.
When Meder was thrown a look through the whirled windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw how uncrude was growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad has been in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest.
Three phases of construction already have this bath; you can discover not only neoroman elements from times of his creation in 1844, but also an Mauric hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool artist Iris Meder - and that is not just because it originated from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge so different construction styles to such a great unit," says Meder.
For such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool seems to be only the next case.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business shine
By Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann has ordered a working group to examine the consequences of the speculation for the poor in the world.
Then, in January, the Concern Shepherd wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it intensifys the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on global raw material stock exchanges increase prices - and therefore banks are involved in the global hunger problem.
Consumer Protectors' campaign is specifically addressed to German-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw materials were intended to secure traders against price changes.
But now most experts agree that the zockers have relaxed from offer and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He promised to examine the accusations and said that no business was "value to risk the good reputation of the German Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently reviewing the claims from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the review is supposed to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the German Bank - as well as recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then inform us about the consequences it has.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch-Chef Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism in the financial sector: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastic how unrespected banks today hurt the general welfare."
Ackermann is now a superior bank lobbyist.
"The Deutsche Bank must erase all the installations from its portfolio where money is spent on bets at food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungry people or the call of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprising on the first view, but it is clear that the Conservé wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the Head of Board will not switch to the Supervisory Board, otherwise than planned.
With a decline from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to be able to refrain, he hardly needs to shave - that would eventually have his follower to do.
Every second would terminate raw material installations
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
So just 11 percent believe that it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers investments in which prices for food are paid.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learn that their bank is involved in such businesses: each other would terminate all investments where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 per cent would advise people from such a bank, 49 per cent claimed to think about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Wien
The Retracted Pavillon
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 reached prices, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and disguised.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern after-war architecture is sweared, by clear shapes, glass halls, courageous barbecues and new materials typically for the technological progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an excellent and famous example for the world exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzers Pavillon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his lightweight and floating steel glass design.
The construction is considered as a milestone of contemporary architecture until today.
He made the architect so proclaimed that he built Austria's Pavillon at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a scooter-large side construction in Munich, he was finally famous internationally in 1973.
His Temporary Exhibition Building Pavillon had been rebuilt after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South Station and opened in 1962 a 20th-century museum – the "20 house" was called it.
However, the building was not suitable spatial and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Yet it was used so long until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the Pavillon, now called "21 house" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, among which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a luck in every way.
In 2007, Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoviered art historian with considerable career, among other things, in the youth as an ice-art runner, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, explicitly spent the conversion with politicians and monumental protectors, she acquired public funds and private sponsor money and determined the use.
Except for present art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same named foundation, a café and a book shop, and a office house had to be built for it.
Strict supervision, small condition
Crissanitz was then the ideal occupation for the implementation.
Not only because he had changed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's secession to Vienna and won competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna, and the Pavillon was a "unusually important place" for him where he had looked at the exhibitions "atmost every weekend".
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost his movement to Vienna and his use of generosity and lightness.
In the current reconstruction there were much bigger problems: the building was "a energy scraper," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fibres were exchanged, used glass-faservered isolated glass and replaced the glass roof with a special safety glass.
Cold bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceiling has been resettled.
Two subsites brought space for the new use, a lowered light burial between house and road ensures the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light-tailer pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is broken in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema is even exactly as he was earlier.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a small amount.
"Oft had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor in the underground.
Despite all the boundaries, problems and restructuring, the building has remained flexible and easily.
Crissanitz recently said that a typical "Drop-in-the-City history" had been difficult with the pavilion, "who came from Brussels".
Such an architecture stands "ever on the wrong place" and still wants to "arouse a proper consciousness".
In this case, the 21rd house is not at the wrong place, because it has occurred a city-based lucky situation: around the Swiss garden, the totally newly planned "Haupthofsquarters", with office and homes.
And another happiness may still occur: The 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz-Bau, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she already negotiates with the city about a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plants winter crises package in million height
The railway has evolved a crisis plan that is intended to prevent the fall of trains in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the German railway is also giving a newspaper report this year over EUR 70 million.
The "Photo" stage previously reported on a group-internal crisis plan, that investments of around EUR 300 million were planned by 2015.
This aims to improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks, even in extreme relocations.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railway stations and railway railways to 16.000 people.
The aim is to free railway railways from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary lakes.
Two months ago, railway chef Rüdiger Grube had warned after a top meeting with government and industry against train failures and delays in this winter too.
Last winter, the passenger traffic railway had considerable problems, as it, among other things, lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Railway Association.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it has to make axes of ICE trains more frequently check in the workshop after an ICE in the Cologne main railway station had an axis break.
Deutsche Bank pays million punishment in the United States
After the Tumult about Chief Josef Ackermann, a new disaster comes from the United States: The German Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home weren't enough for the German Bank, the industry has also received its past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes because of the plague of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a wide range of large banks to lean the cooperative banks with false promises for the purchase of financial products; they would have taken down the risks.
Such papers lost strongly in value during the financial crisis and the banks rise into the depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the topic without having the parties to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any debt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the presence of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. social banks and jumps in on board to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the damage caused by billions of people.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their types.
The Regulator had also prescribed other large banks and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The relevant mortgage-backed securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are the basis of house loans.
When the US-Immobilienblase placed in 2007, this became a destruction of a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank changed Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have been back for a few years, banks are at the moment in the United States to face a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavored countless complaints to obtain refunds or to commit failures.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest complaint wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks that have overused the two US immobile financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage businesses in a volume of around $200 billion.
The German Bank also has to make a complaint by the FHFA, here are several businesses in total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurters to stand straight for "substance losses" but not to mention an exact sum.
The German Bank had rejected the claims as haltless and declared that they wanted to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett rises with 10 billion at IBM
Financialguru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares in value of more than $10 billion.
Until now, the big American investor Warren Buffett had always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies is only badly forecasted.
He has now read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services mainly and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Investment by Warren Buffett is considered a rider beating in the financial world.
Thus, the IT Urgestein IBM may now call itself "Sir IBM".
For Buffett now revealed in the US Economic Sender CNBC that he has bought IBM shares in the value of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM has known anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the management that even in the economic crisis had provided proper profits.
"You've done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been putting on the lucrative IT services for some time, such as the operation of calculating centres.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful corporate calculators.
Buffett had previously avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed for example at a freight railway, at a butterfly manufacturer or machine farmer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole series of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Municher Back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded with smart investment to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unreasonable sense of earning money has brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was known, the IBM share increased by 1 per cent in advance.
"Big Blue", as is also called IBM, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is thus associated with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn't want to come in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is touchable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell" Turkish media doubt the German state of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bluty ideology" that now resurrects.
The murders of eight Turkish councils and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extreme background.
This message is responded with anxiety and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
For for many German towers, there is a long-faithful spoke: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with legal extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is hostility in Germany, however, was never in question.
However, the detected legal extremist network reveals sizes whose dimension is still unreasonable.
"Are the bloody ideology again?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the transgressors is supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical sump.
The Turkish municipality responded to Germany: it reminded the victims of racist violence in the weekend with a Mahnwake in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish advertising agreement.
In happy colors, it had been introduced to each other - as a story of success.
Like an ear fee, the reporting of some Turkish media: "German to the fiftyth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet Platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot also take this thoughtful link.
"It begins to smell," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people were murdered, taxes paid and a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German Turkish Internet Forums, the actions of the police and their success are discussed extremely critically.
The authors are wondering why the German authorities had not much more thought of looking for suspects in the right extremist circles.
Some of them appear to be prepared at least in the way of reducing drastic means: "If wearing here, the migrants remain nothing more than self-defence and armament."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"The goodness of information and properness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties have explained.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event made it clearer for the Turks living here that there is a viable threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can be made in right violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we-feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was mainly accused by the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Möln.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a complaint to the Turkish presidents, but was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel, in his speech, the number of charges made by the Turkish Turks.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the height of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks has been in the state of law since.
In addition to the efforts of extensive information and re-evaluation of legal extreme terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The Skandalbank of Zürisee
The most adventure bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has swallowed from a crisis to the next.
Now it's supposed to be a German.
Axel Weber wouldn't have thought so.
Following his spectacular decline from the top of the Bundesbank, it was known in July that he would enter a nearly as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Governing Board of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber rejoiced publicly, the Swiss praised its beauty and the UBS of its newly gained solidarity and gave friendly comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has done the tournament."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gübel."
But in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had circumcised all the bank's security systems and swallowed around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Head of Board Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
The President-in-Office of the UBS has also been regarded as a struggle - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
It has already become known that Weber is allowed to consult the Bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the Chairmanship in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank informed on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it gets hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and a note banker and would surely have needed a period of operation.
With a strike, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it deserves the title "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because, on the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and has been slaughtered from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank will be saved.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the concealed and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined her with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in investment banking too.
Thus, the UBS 2007 managed with 1,6 billion dollars more money made by customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, as an investment bank in the Liga of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
The strong banker and later long-term bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger say: "I always put the UBS as a model of a good bank to my students at that time."
"From today's perspective, how could I just mislead myself?"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first evident that something belonging was in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Head of Board Peter Wuffli came back surprisingly, which was considered high-intelligent and as brilliant bankers until then.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The Bank's Investment Partie had been filled with subprime papers and had to write a billion.
In order to train this, the UBS announced an increase in the capital of saga and announced 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors for this, but they found some who had ruptured the nose until recently: an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund, which had been so disappeared that one did not even hear his name.
But that was only the first strike.
In April 2008 it became worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, and President of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, returned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: The UBS had to be saved by the State in view of its failure to invest in the financial crisis.
The National Bank purchased the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, the Swiss council gave six billion francs for a compulsory bond that it could become bank owner.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it accommodates such large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance was more than five times the size of Switzerland’s economic performance (see Graphic).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months after that, the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and declared themselves ready to publish the data of potential customers that might have been taxed using the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions and penalties.
In this way, the UBS acknowledged more or less openly to have helped to avoid taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of Head of Board and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the excursion of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through misspeculations and in asset management by helping to avoid taxes.
And just when it became somewhat calmer, just as you thought the UBS would get it back now, then this unstable dealer story follows: a single dealer twisted 1,7 billion euros before the bank notices that something is going wrong.
And it becomes evident: with the risk management in investment banking it is obviously still not working.
"In the case of Adoboli, it has had to be found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economy and Financial Professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It had been the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had a long time ago to become guards of the world's great wealth: no excessive risks, security of money for it - would even be allowed to break down the world beyond the Alps Republic.
The security of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of incremental reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly precious chocolate.
The UBS central in Zurich is still suitable for the cliché of the divided Swiss Private Bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at the Zuricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is embraced by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
You can find jewelry like Tiffany's here between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
The Swiss banks have remained here for centuries: from the National Bank over the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy spin door.
Inside the walls are marble clothed, thick leather seats are ahead, besides the bank logo, a great sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss Great Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the Chief of a small Swiss Private Bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, eventually he makes business with the two large banks, like all Swiss bankers.
The UBS has become too large, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the fishing axes have spread.
The Swiss had no more to say there.
"And if so, they've long been adapting to the seats of the angels."
In fact, it was the angel Saksian Investment Banking that changed the UBS, gave its first high profits and then the Debakel: no European financial institution has lost as much money as the Swiss Great Bank in the subprime jungle.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the largest rescue action in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the big bank that was standing before bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was too large in the merger for the small Switzerland - and continued to grow.
This helped to complement the two different banks of the UBS: a rich, but sleeping bank with the focus of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came in favour of a lot of money to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Concern Secretary of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researchers Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked up from the bank teaching to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that overwhelmingness came before the case.
Workers of the UBS clearly remember the leadership meetings on which the Group Manager Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs hit from the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She mentioned the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the exchange business and in the stock trade, she played with the top.
Corporate consultants who were assigned, however, highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
Depending on growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime plants.
She developed into a huge machine that packed and continued securities on American hypothesis credits - but also maintained risks itself.
Also, when other banks were looking for the exit.
"Now in summer 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the Euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after the other had to go as the cleaning of the attempts seemed more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become a seat and are awful until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
It has to find a strategy for a bank that has delivered all nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger has already an idea: end with investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far the bank does not want to go (now).
But the investment banking is supposed to diminish strongly, so much is already clear.
On the next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors.
He has now understood: He is supposed to run the UBS businesses permanently, the Zuricher Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive the Investment Bank back to the stand in the middle of the 1990s.
3500 places he stretches.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has already asked.
To date, publicly he just says that he will first seek a apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. stock exchanges
The threatening recession in Europe has encouraged the US investors to take up the weekly.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without stroke.
The distorted industrial production on the continent was causing the hopes of a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the cuisine.
The general ease of government change in Rome and Athens could not be achieved.
The euro fell to the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass has still golded as half full last week, not as half-empty - but now the problems have been emphasized again,” said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, financial values were on the lists of sales.
The Dow-Jones index of standard values recorded at the end of trade with a minus of 0.6 per cent at 12.078 points.

Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly decreased its production and is aimed at the end of the increase.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistics Office reported.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman by Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession as soon as possible, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, an investment investor, just confirmed this caution: it is still not clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it would be too early for him to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade of old principle over the crowd and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over $10 billion in IBM supported the share rate of the traditional group and made it at first note just a percent higher against the trend in trade.

Intelligent crowns spread in cities
In many places, seed creams are considered as "problem birds": but from the cities the high-intelligent animals are far from being distributed, claim experts.
The one likes them, the other wants to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city picture for centuries, but in many municipalities, the inhabitants are crushing and noise of the animals.
A means against the "problem birds" has not yet been in sight.
Seed crows are no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first cream symposium in the East Friesian empty.
There experts from the whole Federal territory offer possible ways of excursion.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Natural Protectors also caused the problems in cities to result in the aerodrome of specially protected seed creams: the chemical use in agriculture increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the cases of typical brute trees made the birds difficult to live.
Crowns are under natural protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 brute pairs include in the western follic coast, among other things in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for massive killing of crowns in the rural circle had provided negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in birdfalls and the killing of knobs as particularly brutal.
"The normal excretion, the excretion, brings nothing," the city and landscape planner Werner Klövern found out of empty.
Nearly spray away with water or fall trees, often have unwanted consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are shaken out, large colonies are splitting up and spreading in other places."
Worship is only possible as an exception to hospitals, age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away."
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said out of empty.
It is possible to use a combination of aggravation of animals from sensitive residential areas and lock offers to resettle them elsewhere.
On the other hand, "Infotables instead of chain seeds" was the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different dealing with the animals: "We can ultimately endure a pickle in the face."
Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, which informed the signs of the life of the highly intelligent seed creams.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
In criticism of the noise of the birds, Jürgens had its own opinion: "There is a lot of communication that has much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed cranes use not only aids to get to a delicious bite, but make their tools themselves.
Conduct researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four seed creams, as far as the intelligence of the birds is concerned.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a stone to crash in order to get to a motel larve.
Without a lot of training, they decisively recognized the size and shape of a stone to allow the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the tough crowns had to solve a more tough problem.
In a vertically set cylinder, the researchers had placed a small eimer with a motel larve.
With the nail, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had placed wirepieces to them.
From this, all four animals formed a crochet, and with the help of which they hung the eimers on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed creams even succeeded in anhieb.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained out.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are included in the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have resolved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Following the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and perfected the fifth EM participating after the 0:0 of the Hinspiel.
The Czechs reached 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at the outside of Montenegro, after the replay (2:0) had been a clear thing.
No more burning also left Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland picked up a locker 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82th) and Miguel Veloso (80th) achieved the further meetings for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41th) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had shortened two times for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-rode map (54.).
Bosnia has already failed to Portugal in the Play-offs to WM 2010 in South Africa.
In Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased a free shot from about 30 meters to the early lead in the masks.
A good quarter hour later Nani showed his wide-shot quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the Latte, but the ball did not exceed the gate line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, Judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergoldding was in the centre.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty room, Stark decided on sulphur and showed the Portuguese the yellow map (36.).
On the contrary, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after a action by Fabio Coentrao, which surely transformed Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four meetings.
In the 81th minute, Petr Jiracec also ended the last doubts for Czech Republic.
The European Champion of the European Union of 1976 will then go to the EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of Trainer Michal Bilek with the Federal Ligionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) had luck and had to survive a horror secrecy in the early phase.
Endman Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflection in the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot only nearly by the gate of Cech in the 40th minute from the rotation of the criminal space border.
After the break, the Querlatte had to save for the already beaten World Class Tower of the Czechs, the storm had withdrawn from the FC Seoul (50).
The gate even before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey missed the football wonder of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not come out in Zagreb more than a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hid thinks that it must be as safe as possible to remove its place on the bank of the WM third of 2002, the Croatians may rejoice over their fourth participation in a EM entrepreneur.
Before 31,000 spectators in the Maximir Stadion, the Turks had almost reached a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the pockets in the seventh minute with a distance shot, the attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't lower the paller in the gate.
However, after the horror technology, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians had nothing to burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic place from the 62th minute, the Federal Liga-Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern München) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Intracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni travels to EM
In Dublin the Irish first EM participation has been celebrated in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4-0 success in the event, in the 32th minute.
Constantine Vassiljev (57.) equals for the guests.
Ireland pressed on the pace from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment, the Estonian rear crew prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was so far.
After a defective defence of the final man Pavel Londak, Ward was at the place and pressed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the next few years and is about to double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion) are intended to flow, the Dax Group informed on Tuesday.
"We are going to create additional research and development facilities and set up employees accordingly," announced Co-Chef Bill McDermott at a customer trade fair in Beijing.
Employment is intended to grow from around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of establishments of the world market leader for corporate software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP has been presented in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are sitting in the tree country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building stone of the Dax Group's 2015 strategy.

SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities..." explained McDermott.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China based on comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
With empathy and generosity Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Frightening. A story of the First World War, which tells in nineteen fate", begins with a long list of main persons that go to heart.
Here is a hint for how to handle: Cut this page out carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments where you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of the war and your illusions are robbed.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of the anti-historic history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, angry reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unrecognised men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanics to mountain climbers, doctors, car drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose members, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives flashes up like the Votivkerzen in a church, some add while others are erased.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the devastating position war at the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" walks with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on bee baskets, a celebrated Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetfly are an unresolved problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods over the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, who smells after Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming anyway?
I don't think anyone understands what's happening or why this war is being carried out at all.
"Feiling facts," says Englund, "were furnished with suspects, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life accounts may be terrifying or greeting, but they are extremely alive in Englunds the lossing collection of small moments in detail.
Many of them act of lack and help Him.
In the history of a German school girl, he says, "replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radiator rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells us more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "flesh made of printed rice and baked in hammel fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes which were sold with wood."
There was, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of juices, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories act of honor and courage.
A American recognizes his own desire for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite all this, it was more intended for men than to sit in the lean chair, with the evening sheet or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and so to do than to mean such a fassade civilization and as if there were no barbaries behind the own strengthened and beaten shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he probably dies and no one will notice it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the idea of offering yourself, you want to think this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe that falls apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the still young age": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a measured suit that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People are acting in an unforeseen way and there is a free behavior as well as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get into a prostitution with a sexual disease to escape the front service.
"The great expression of it can be discovered in the trading of gonocoke-ethers, because soldiers bought and smed on their genitals, in the hope of coming to the hospital," he writes.
"The one who was really despaired cried him in his eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes flattered and yet uninteressant and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he begins the way the war was "in a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly fake like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans like Erich Maria Remarques "No new in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's like he took us away from the nose with his book this page with the main individuals and burned us with a strap wood.
After an early failure, a minutely scheduled assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them were carrying helmets.
They had decided for the night from Monday on Tuesday because at this time there were little people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others believed to take part in a exercise at the beginning.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The events of the past weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the deputy and made the housekeepers a huge increase in public sympathy, was no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randall Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid deposition of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park came "in the last minute," someone who was familiar with the commands said what a declaration was spoken as "training".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge did not know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to stay anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the resort."
One reason for secreting was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14th, officials wanted to clear the park, but then wake back when hundreds of protesters gathered together after they had learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the Tuesday surgery, including operational commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, which are usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people go in and out in the park, almost like pendlers, so 1 o'clock in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this if the least number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Saving car with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously recorded news that drowned from the speakers seemed to be scared by many protesters.
When public officials walked into their bright blue wind jackets into the park, many protesters simply rafted their stuff together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 no tents would be touched to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the surroundings to intervene, arrests should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said the association of officials was very raw.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in the Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great confusion on the personal things of the protesters, including bags, artificial grasses and suitcases with clothes, their employees followed the cleaning of the city, which had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged out. Images of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park Position.
Some constructed barriers and the police continued their methodic arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officers of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
The circulation was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police statements.
Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of arrests came, as he said, due to "inappropriate conduct and opposition to an arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department, the highest unified official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "does not run the operation," as Mr Browne said.
In the case of access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barrikads were built.
It was possible to observe how these police locations expanded the surroundings around the Zuccotti Park.
One place was observed how several officials, many of them with protective signs, driving people out.
Some 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5:00 p.m., a protester jumped south of the Pine Street to the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of the tyre of a police bus.
In one place the quantity wasted a piece of timber.
At the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of the maintainer will submit complaints against the city for dismissal
The trade unions, who represent hundreds of schoolcareers who lost their workplace last month, plan to complain the city on Wednesday, since the dismissal is not necessary and discriminatory because of their unpleasant influence on the schools that are teaching poor students.
The complaint is probably the last possibility that the trade unions, District Council 37, are still open in their efforts to repent the releases.
Six hundred and twenty-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the most poorly paid employees in the city and had lost their work in a chess train on 7 October, described the trade unions leader as political revenge for the refusal of access to a health fund that the working groups had undergone, with which the budgetary gap should be closed last year.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the releases were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the city council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget specifies that school assistants would be released.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the lodging of the complaint before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint will raise Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education in the city as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as complainants who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city was unable to comment on the complaint and thus could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a complaint that the New York Times is present, the trade unions have focused on the number of school releases in the army districts of the city to support a complaint about unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools had lost more helpers since they were chronicly underfunded.
She explains that while there were no releases on State Island and only a few releases in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight schoolers who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of deceased parents who can organize donations to capture budget reductions."
P.S.: The 36th district budget was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year. Furthermore, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method of extrafinance for each enrollment of the arms school.
The trade unions also complain that the heads of high schools were led through the language in a memo into the wrong, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translate) in the USA usually describes the change of a teacher from the list of wages of a school into a pool of available workers paid by the Central Office.
"Six and sixty coordinators have been dismissed, not overrided," says the draft complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready to communicate with Libya
Finally, it looks like republics and democracies in Washington are already being able to understand about the rebellions in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolts, the arrest and murder of Muammar Gaddafi, a long-term dictator, and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate Committee decides on international relations with the Senate, which supports the President John Kerry (Massachussetts) with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) and praises Libya for the successful rebellion and American troops for their "mout".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but to date nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawyers of both parties and the White House argued about the voting of a number of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of the US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide margin group of both parties and no vote was made.
However, on the same day this law fell through the Senate, and the Chamber also agreed to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This led the U.S. mission into a kind of legislative feather fire - with an assembly that, although it was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not wrathful enough to ultimately pull the floor under his feet.
Then the unconscientiousness of the convention was overcome by the events.
In August, Tripolis fell among the Libyan Rebels and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-freeness" and "the men and women of the U.S. military military and their coalition partners, who support military operations to protect people in Libya, commend their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Agency or will they split the legislators, as the Law of June did?
The last version is the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republic of the Committee.
Lugar's speaker said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change which calls for a balanced budget to have a top priority in almost every Congress legislature period of the Republicans and some democratics.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change in the budget or any other area which is at the moment to be voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have unfortunately tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlattes' amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been presented to this convention and include a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been presented both to the convention and to the Senate - others are simply diverging from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of compensation budget change and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to polish their lives - the opportunity to pride by "writing" such a measure.
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary balance.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution which supported the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some Members want to limit the number of provisions which may be presented by members of the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to withdraw the limitation to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among equal sexes is, like a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a constantly recurrent template.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws when two-thirds of the States reject them.
As the Members are proposing amendments, they are moving as faster as they have been in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, the Lawgiver submitted 77 such amendments in the 110th Convention 66.
The rate is increased compared to the early 1990s where members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the convention in 1789.
"Followed but not defeated," said Giffords in the first TV interview after the Attentat
Ten months after a armed man from the next distance during an electoral event in Tucson shot her, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) entered Monday evening in the national television. She alone sang to the Broadway-strip "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to the convention.
When she arrived in the ABC messages "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer, she rang by word and needed help in walking.
The mission showed the severe slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which divided its head, burried through the left side of her brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the convention to give her voice triumphingly to the debt brake.
In their first TV interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "severy".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) answered: "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20" special, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special follows Gifford's recovery since the Attentate of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with silly raged heads and a long shell over the head.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A cock with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You see how the congress delegates, together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin" sing.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that he had read a article of a newspaper on March 12 about the Attentate when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who had been killed during the Attack.
The suspected Guard Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while he is waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you haven't been defeated?" said Kelly.
You were just hit.
And you will stand through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gala that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a label, hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The quantity in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in the spring.
A ranked military officer on the Gala, including the head of the staff and the former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphan children," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organisers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The cracks of conflicting impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are caught with praise for their victims.
But the commendation has its prize, say ministers.
The public is increasingly acting as if you were suffering people in uniform.
"We were not at all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support the one is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unthankful or in conflict with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger, against the returning troops in the last years of Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in the breast and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of fear because they defeated rebells and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "writing, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an elevated state post in Washington after his return.
During his work search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtlely asked whether he was able to resist the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your ministry, you have to hold the negative impressions against," explained Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in war.
Performances in the battlefield are often taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual during the Second World War," said General David Barno a.D., the U.S. troops commanded in Afghanistan.
Rather, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost or the gravity of their injuries.
Military forces the growing pressure to rape hard
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervening in the case of rape before the military court.
If not, hundreds of complainants are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her cassettes in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12-pack of beer with her.
He asked her if he could accompany her to a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells started," said Lyman.
But the Texaner waste her concerns side by side.
I thought, "Oh, what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind them, pushed them down and raped them, claiming her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military officers are anxiously waiting for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it will be decided to approve a complaint against the former defence minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, to the court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not taken action against the widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional law of the soldiers.
In February, by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint included at first 17 complainants, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who alleges that they were raped or sexually abused by soldiers, and that the military failed to detect, condemn, or provide a proper jurisdiction in accordance with the assumptions.
Burke says she's following the highest military leadership, as the problem starts there.
"The military is herearchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of revenge? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 survivors since February, many of them may be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of laying all complainants their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many other complaints to maintain pressure.
The Defence Team for the Defence Ministry, led by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are present in Newsweek, are detailed in the defence strategy, mainly that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which the armies have come.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not responsible for infringements of soldiers in active service.
"The suspected damage occurred during the complainant military service," says the document.
The Defence Ministry refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: there are three other complaints except them.
At the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four major military academys for suspected promotion of a female enemy atmosphere.
Independently, the publicly useful Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis "Personal Disorder" that received rape victims to release them from the service - a ordinary procedure according to anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group lodged a complaint against the veteran administration (i.e., the administration of war veterans) in which they discriminated their discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who stated that they were sexually abused in the ministry.
Nine laws were presented to the convention by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, which offer a number of points of reference.
According to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sexual Abuse) the Ministry of Defense 3 3 158 sexual abuses were shown in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and, according to the estimate of the pentagon, this figure takes account of about 13,5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that come to each year.
The report published in March also examines the rates of criminal prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases incurred in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspected rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a variety of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before her friend was assaulted.
Six persons declared themselves characteristic in the name of the suspected actor, who was finally released.
"I remember well the day that the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the waves would take place, and I ran out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, that was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonestly dismissed, so that she would not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, which Lyman and the other complainants have brought forward, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Legal Science at the George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he says, "I think they should move forward."
What is between them and a sentence is this doctrine, which is criticised since it was questioned for the first time.
I am a critic of the Feres Doctrine in time.
The military is a decade afterwards, because they do not have the same incentive and the same disturbance that a liability brings.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with its hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until it comes to reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers you watch on Facebook
Before he became a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration measure online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed, had committed in July at an amoclope in Norway, where 77 people were killed, his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far not alone in the cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack before his computer and talked with some of the millions of nationalists who support legally extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That's easy - you just have to log in at Facebook.
"We found it wasn't difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published by the British Ideal Factory DEMOS on digital popularism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to precisely determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett's team found a half million fans of extraordinary groups across Europe and then showed them with Adds, but instead of linking themselves to a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey in which their educational status, their attitude toward violence and the appreciation of their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 attendants of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having had to leave their office only once.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online supporters of legal extreme groups are mostly young, male and angrily about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising rotation, "those who combine their online activity with a offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is only an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideal factories, medical researchers and politicians use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you normally do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all of this goes away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook tend significantly more to drink problems than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that students, such as residents, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify hazardous children that would otherwise not have been found."
Facebook also constantly uses the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's day, election participation in the 2010 intervals and a National Happiness Index (which has been used primarily information on which only Facebook has access - Master of Digital Freedom has long known that the page should make its large data findings available for others for research purposes).
But the users of Facebook know that the page observes them whether they want to do that or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to deliver your personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined directives how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the data are true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of socially - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Kald and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted two amoclaups who killed 77 people this summer in Norway, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider of Norway," he said before a court hall with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support Hassideology and thus support multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not confess."
Judge Torkel Nesheim suspended Breivik during this monologue, "that he wouldn't give Brevik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who gave a pre-developed speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik keep investigating for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and barbecue.
Everyone participated in the goal of closure.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue lock and acted quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked journalists and survivors into the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre note that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not spiritually sick and said that there was no evidence that he had competitors.
Some may like that the attacks of 22 July seemed to be the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the pain and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not," said the relative of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons of the interview with the dead Steve Jobs that was shown this week in a theatre
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compare him to Henry Ford and highlighted the technology genius as a large modern inventor.
But what Apple fans may find most insightful in recently discovered jobs interview, which has been dumped out in the important markets this week, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and working courses.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-named hippie, but he was also an acribic organiser who eagerly built charts - a man who believed that many managers suffer from "a disease of thinking," that is a really great idea 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of experts" on the breakup of the staff computer. And he was sitting over an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed discussions.
At that time, as ten years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiotes, he says that the copying templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This easily revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate detailed interviews, jobs appear to be surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, where jobs clearly weigh his thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism is manifest when he seems to respond inpatiently to Cringelys questions and pushs him to take a faster look at topics or side-trends of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview appears somewhat immensely widely when jobs evaluate what other companies make his opinion correct or wrong and represent their own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthume reviews of career jobs', but seeing jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he left and did it.
A quick view of seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, so it is made easy."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continue its efforts to rationalize accounting with Apple.
Unbelievable how costs have been recorded - mostly it started with "standard costs" which were counted on mere suspects and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined to the least.
How the Pope became especially prepared:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the telephone company and speak remotely for free.
About the device has been written a lot, but jobs' enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-employment, is infectious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a fee-paid phone, working a call and then connecting from an AT&T network to another while slideing as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you grilled in the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next," says Jobs kicherend.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars on infrastructure throughout the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike that Wozniak and he almost moved off when they called in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were as well able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomats, they had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he was in love with the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
When he was 12 years old looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone, jobs received part-time jobs at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured".
He was as big as a bag, had a small screen with a brown tube and I was in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, jobs talk about how to invent spontaneously new products.
Already in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to combine the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the composition and supply of the finished devices.
Later on Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember decisive arguments... you screamed me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredible.
About large companies who leave down:
Long before he relived Apple, jobs saw the ways on which so many industrial giants had been riding with their visions in stolpers and lost control over their shares.
"We say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copy or printer, na and?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopolie position is required by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products, extinct - crafts art.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You took the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning a lot about his clothes.
You have to vote, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Finally, it goes beyond the taste, it goes to try to put apart with the best thing that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what they do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, steal great artists.
We're always ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws when court accepts case
On the day at which the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question of whether to listen to a complaint of President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was sponsed by the Office to represent the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to consult on the petitions for testing.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint that 26 states have raised against the widespread reform of health, which was decided last year by the convention, a law that has been the slogan of conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to stimulate the 2012 Presidency struggle, which will be in full at the time when the court decision is made known.
The lawyer who is standing before the court and who will claim that the law is to chicken will probably be Paul Clement, once General State Prosecutor under George W. Bush's government.
Clement's Office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two thousand companies who supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-aged group dedicated to defending conservative principles.
Another company, which represents the dinner sponsor, Jones Day, one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contests the law.
Another sponsor was pharmacegiant Pfizer Inc., who is financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the group head of the Republicans in the Senate and an explanated opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have visited events of the federalist society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the Lower Federal Judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in the laws of closer and other organisations, whereas the judge cannot be a spokesman, a guest or, according to the programme, no guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas reached two of the offices related to the case and a company with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
"This astonishing fraud with morality and the opposite to the code, the complaints of some judges are lieing, the court is following the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnered during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any right to inpartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are led by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general prosecutor under Obama government when the first law contested in the first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case because of prejudice, because she was too engaged in the defence of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make announcements to do this.
Boeing draws a record job of 18 billion dollars to land
Airline Emirate orders 50 two-passed aircraft of type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other planes.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft is totally at a record sum of $18 billion.
The contractor of Boeing is also unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft at the value of $450 billion in the coming 20 years.
Boeing announced his largest order for commercial aircraft in the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
In 2011, Boeing announced it on Dubai Airline View, the airline also has an option for the purchase of 20 other aircraft, which increases the total list price to $26 billion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered the petrol consumption and comfort of passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these planes is more than one billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock exchange professional of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oilproducing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the planes. Instead, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines because this is one of their largest cost points, is not as harmful as the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move flight orders when the oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural safeguard," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position on the market for large space aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitors SAS in chess, which attacks the position of premium with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the air view comes four months after Airbus has announced that the introduction of the largest A350, which is competing directly with the 777-300ER, would be moved.
Introduction was shifted to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher burden of benefit and reach.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to lose a choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported opponents of Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the race around the governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent elections. On Monday, she claimed that drug dealers had influenced the race in favour of one of their opponents.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around the governor's posts in the Western State by the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the surveys ... you occupied electoral cabins, built road blockads ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the Presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, which had led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to acknowledge Vallejo as a victor.
Silvano Aureoles, Candidate of the Left Democratic Revolution Party PRD, the currently official governor, came to place three, a severe defeat for the divided and lucky left leadership of the Presidential election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, rejects connections with drug dealers and urges other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been dominated for a long time by drug cards specialized in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a militaryly conducted offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an electoral event for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates were expelled from fear from local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how absurd the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is probably represented in the race for the Presidential Office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will let us look courageously in the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help in the rescue of the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downstream that will slow down the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB seated in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic nations in the world must do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary block either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China), who looked "free of distress" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all the means."
The European Monetary Union has suffered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers have retired from both Italy and Greece.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe raises fear that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to reputations that the leading threshold countries would have to join together to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any aid from Asia would be channeled by the IMF, but he said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of Bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Ministry of Trade, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the euro area, since its own economy is now suffering from the falling exports and the drying foreign capital flow.
"Nobody wants the euro area to remain instable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to receive a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have the right to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the U.S. Brown University, said that it would be very difficult politically to sell 1,2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which over 800 million dollars or less live on the day.
"Sometime they will find out that the Greeks with 50 are retired and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used in order to preserve numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losses of institutions such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" on all Asia.
The forecast of ADB with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/ threatens "the risk of graduation" due to the threatening risk from Europe.
He said that harmful threshold markets had to create "crisis plans" in order to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defence
Defense Minister Leon Panetta called on the assembly on Monday when he warned that automatic budget decline would weaken the national security unnoticed, so he launched a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil river bands.
The Pentagon already reflects declines of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that further declines will be required by $600 billion or more if the convention cannot achieve a finalisation in the expenditure.
"The effects of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to achieve a budgetary agreement, which will lead to a so-called combat, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such a unconsidered way, would make most of our ship- and construction projects inappropriate - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large majority of our civil staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to allow civilians with certain probability to achieve the objective."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alert will."
The declines have finally been hit by the fighting troops," said Panetta.
"While the war time quotas in the anti-terror fight are not directly affected by combating, the serious intervention in the basic budget would affect the war efforts badly," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and attitude oversights that support the war."
"The wages of staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to war time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic reductions on the Defence Ministry.
"The consequences of combating the Defence Ministry would start a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are frightening against this draconic act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing that we should be pressed on."
"The combat is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will reinforce demands to take the Pentagon out of shortages remain awaiting.
Panetta has increasingly unblemished the possible reductions, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is faced with difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister painted a dark picture, which could be ahead - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air-wave without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It's a paperyer, a army of casernes, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening talk at Pentagon.
"There is a force of war that lacks morality and warning and which is not able to take it up with potential opponents."
"She makes a person really angry."
In an annex to its letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta mentioned new details how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global use and capability, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be victims, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing aircraft, the next generation of ballistic U-boat, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new soil fighter, which need army and navy to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and testing of F35, this would save up to 80 billion dollars in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to rear up, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Destroy a Lie
A view of the current headers shows how considerate and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The President-in-Office of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is engaged in becoming the accusations of sexual harassment since several women.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the Minid because it is claimed that reports have been kept back after which a retired football trainer abused boys sexually.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lie is destroying career and shocking countries.
The New York Congress Assembly and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool when he brought rejections in circulation, which were very quickly rejected by inconsistent evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringements in the campaign financing related to the provision of an outmarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced the media circuit that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office at the Oval Office.
Stories of foam in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers have provided their students with the test answers so that they were able to do well in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lie and foam are okay.
How much deceit do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies, however, are deemed to be liars.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Discovering or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, and this is both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game, such as scarads, where it is the goal of calling "Have you!" is to declare a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected at viewed universities over the past six decades, which carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physology.
One result of research is that most of the old myths have been dishonored about lying.
Lying looks into your eyes.
They don't always stumble, stamp, red, and scratch.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these liars are difficult to discover and distinguish.
A practiced lie defender can come through to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine face expressions, the questioning and timing.
I spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of depreciation. And it is clear that declaring a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us to remedy in our complex world, especially if the setting or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in appreciating other people, wearing their interests and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitive how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know that extroverted people are more frequently lying than introverted people that men often oppose "self-storited" lies than women whose lie is more "oriented to others" - they usually want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less frequently lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if a person was dishonored as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty to have lied to that person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughing, the voice quality of the test person.
You should better know when someone normally triples with the foot, so they do not accuse him wrongly when he triples with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of gatherings of remarkable verbal and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of depreciation.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet turn towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position significantly, or show a "relax after the setting conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Assistants often falsely signal that a setup conversation is over, only to keep looking out after this relaxation after the setup conversation.
In addition, pay attention to the language of your test person.
Scott Peterson's excavator is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his murdered wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiting people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when you repeat a tough question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tough question, "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... for best knowledge and conscience."
This will make the answer more perceived than practical, which often causes alarm bells to shrink.
There is no means of magic to declare lies, but you can learn capabilities thanks to which a declaration is possible.
Thanks to these capabilities, everyone rarely can become a victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of oil pipeline is revised after risk by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama Government threatened to delay the authorisation of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which was being angry with the trade unions and at the same time calmed environmental protectors, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project to return to normality.
Trans Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the House building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline is finally approved, although with a different course.
This was made after an announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision on a federal permit for the project would be held until the new possible history has been reviewed that avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, compared to Fox News.
The new environmental review by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may last by 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and admitted its support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was linked Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline had to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the lawyers of Nebraska, which are against the plan, deviate the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and water.
The current study on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy indicates that the chief auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate sentence of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was set up by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was assigned to conduct the original study was an unappropriate choice, as it is linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused because she claimed to force a child out of fear to break up
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her manhattan building would have had a tobacco attack that would have scared her little daughter so that she would have surrendered.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "Personal Changes, Sleep Disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, wanted to break up a child guardian and Genevieve for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building at the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
" Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive sound, "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and started to cheat - she used the F Word and the A Word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started to climb water from the bottle to me.
She said Geneva had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be retained by her accompanying and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cryed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an excuse in writing, but was not answered.
LaBelles lawyer and representatives did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is on an inadequate replacement, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he wouldn't take account of a honourary and plan the family, the money they get, would give child cancer help.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is placed on the day of a child guardian who is carrying a 18-month-old baby on the arm."
Climate disturbances slow down the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is at the government, in Sinaloa unemployment and black work increased, while foreign investments went down and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the economic history of Sinaloa will remain in mind. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who denotes himself as the initiator of change, and that great hopes about economic growth are at the government. However, as a result of climate contradictions, growth cannot be the speech, but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators worsened.
The low temperatures in February did not only cause losses in millions of agriculture but also close limits to the growth of the state economy and resulted in a general decrease in economic activity in the first quarter, with 3.6 per cent This is mainly a result of the historical reduction in agricultural development, which has a significant impact on further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the impact of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural holdings were damaged, 78.03 per cent of which were perfect and the rest of 21,07 per cent were partially destroyed.
The fall in economic activity until November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía has observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter of the year, for from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the population of workers. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting from 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year depends on several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are observing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the reductions in the funds made by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in the Congress, because it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest or use something else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country on looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. On the one hand, this is due to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there too. These people are staying here and seeking work here that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high share of black work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38% of employees in the country who are working without paying into the social insurance funds.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages, the lowest in all Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Regional Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the total state average of 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
In addition to reducing economic activity and growing unemployment, in 2011 the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the past ten years is recorded. According to Secretaría de Economía (Secretaria de Economía) the ADI was $630.597 from January to June, which corresponds to a defence of 87.74 percent compared to $5 143.312 in the same period of the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrolo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) represents an overall investment of 17.280 000 pesos in 2011, which is mainly originated by companies from the tertiary sector.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis, the national government in July applied for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested to reactive the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdés' government inability was revealed in the first year of government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformazión (State Chamber of Processing Industry in Mexico), represented that no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the national government, in 2011.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really necessarily needed this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to work twice. The efforts of all the government teams that have already been well agreed have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country's economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The small economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not in sufficient movement to create an economic dynamic that could produce a acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore we will conclude the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine calling
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Company Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, declared that it is necessary to cause the State to become more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we have seen that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for re-determining the economic calling and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There is a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government's efforts to better trains.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current government has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest due to 8 kg of marijuana
A inhabitant of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days for the possession of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The Prosecutor of the Republic announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the property of Marihuana for trade.
According to the Act of AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military on 7 June 2010 in the monitoring of the road Cipriano Valdez against the guard No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer drove in a white truck where he stored a black bag in a box in the car and on the trailer seat, where the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the consigned product was transferred to the judge of the district and the punishment remains in the execution office.
Debts for construction
The social buildings provided for in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are at risk of not being completed because of the lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that even though the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the funds that are available for the three programmes over 11 million pesos.
He said that the overall investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. To date, only Federazión and the municipality would have taken account of funds for construction work, and therefore a delay in the closure of construction was expected.
"Twelve million have to pay for them, and even though the year is over, they have not given us phennig, and that, even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already started the construction work, and they have already been far advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled his obligations, so at the beginning of its reign, the municipality had to take a loan of 7 million, which corresponds to the amount that the central government had to pay.
"This had already happened to us during the last legislature period, because the state had not sufficient economic resources. The programmes went on and this year we had to get the funds that the State had not spent to participate in these programmes," he executed.
Although the government authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Ministry of Administration and Finances, as requested, was to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"Only 12 million have to contribute, and even though the year is over, they haven't given us a phennig."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) referred to the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate and the House of Members against the presidial release and rejected the shift of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes necessary for the law contested.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his competences when he issued the law decree with details on switching to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute raised by the Senate because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes to allow the court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the complaint prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to explain the legal decree for constitutional infringement, since the regulations relating to radio and television are responsible for the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), and therefore the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal reserves.
The benefits of the project were Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members had sufficient constitutional difficulties against the decree of law, and after accepting the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the law decree and launched all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Members without intervening in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister said not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government cannot regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I do not believe that if you do so, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body." It also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is responsible for national matters.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have been made throughout the world in recent years, and it improves the use of the radioelectric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponing of the change, she felt that it was a delay in the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in public interest which has not only technical aspects, "for it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These issues, she stressed, "required the action of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the State, they included a group of characteristics that put the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She called to remember that many countries around the world had already carried out digital conversion, even though they had highly specialized institutions.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the competences of the Congress with the issue of the contested law decree, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the vote lists in Michoacán is considered individually
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of single counting of the voting list is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programmea de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place of the governorial elections is almost 27 per cent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this respect, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that last 9 November, the election body had adopted a number of rules for harmonising local rules with the reforms of the federal states in election matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his voting law nor his law on election justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the State indicator within the time limits set for it to have objected to the argument or objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislative and assessed the voice of the State Representative on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since it does not have the right to "decision or a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained at an interview on the possibility of a single counting of votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by Consejo General del IEM, the possibility was now that the local election authority could count the voting lists partially or completely.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not agree; the Protocol on the counting of votes and the calculation of votes is not actually present or is not in possession of the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are obvious errors or changes in the protocols.
In addition, the total counting of the fully filled electoral certificates may be made if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the one on the second place which is equal or less than a percentage, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or the coalition chairman who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The number of votes may also be made in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is found that the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate at the second place is equal or less than a percentage, provided there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become the second. In this case, the choice packages suspended by a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is nearly 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be spread across the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés set down this Sunday evening at Saltillo, its place of birth. On Monday the dead sight and a dead mess took place.
According to family members, the last will of Colonel was that his ashes would be spread across the Zapalinamé mountains.
After an honour, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, with the others killed in the accident, in a plane of the Mexican Air Forces. The chiefs attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock at midnight, the chief lieutenant's ashes landed at the mourning hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends came.
At 17.30 p.m., his remains were investigated at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo. This body view was launched by his former students from the technical apiture and his American football team, Felipe Bacio during his preparation for the abiture.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and to spread his ashes over the Zapalinamé mountains, which he had always said that to his family and friends," announced Sandra Bacio Cortés, a sister of the pilot.
From her perspective, the Lieutenant had fulfilled all his dreams, and she believes that he was in the abundance of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he always admitted to his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the place of Saltillo very young to enter the school of Zapopán Air Force, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it would even dim him on a truck. Yet he always sought to fulfil his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he was driven to the graduation of his family, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One last farewell.
The Chief Lieutenant of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honor under the leadership of governor Jorge Torres López. His honor gave him the people and the government, the Mexican Army of the Sixth Military Area, the Mexican Air Force, School Manager and Students of the Technology Education Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985, and he saw as excellent in the course and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter flyed by him, in which the State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons were sitting from the same authority were crashing.
At 18.05 p.m., the insulted remnants of Bacio Cortés, the citizens of Saltillo, met to be transferred to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. There his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were already expected.
The abandoned bodies were found on a land on the Cadereyta NL
Some hours before the discovery, military members presented the media with eleven people arrested in the same community in connection with organised crimes.
Three men were found by shots in different parts of the body and a grace shot in an abandoned Finca in Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the miles point 1.5 from Cadereyta to Santiago on the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several temporary persons saw that the door of the landhouse surrounded by a beige-brown wall was resurrected.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three persons in the interior about three meters, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; another was dressed with a white top.
Nearly one meter away, the body of another person with red T-shirt and blue pants was located.
All three were on the stomach.
According to local information, the three persons must have been murdered in another place, since no cartridges were found.
On the wall of the house are recipes that write one organized criminal band to another, and several deposits were found in wall and door.
11 persons arrested in Cadere area
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretariat for State Defence) presented 11 persons, including a minor person who was part of a crime process that was mainly active in the place of Cadereyta, and who were associated with kidnapping, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret burials.
After public information, eight persons were first arrested in the settlement of Los Alveros on November 11, and a prisoner was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. The arrested confirmed to be members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".

They are charged with secret assemblies in the places of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday Education of the New Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present it to the new government, which has led the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of economic breakdown, to offer the head.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present it to the new government, which has led the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of economic breakdown, to offer the head.
A notice from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm government formation on Wednesday.
It is assumed that he will present a multitude of Technocrates-based cabinet, although it is still not clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government formation.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm government formation, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well set," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an inconsistent level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, has to approve a hard saving package that the europoliticians have requested to regain the trust in Italy.
The pressure on the acceleration of Monti was still increased by the diverging market situation, as a result of which the Italian government bonds were charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years, and this corresponds to the state where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Conf Industriea, informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government in all powers."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The success chances of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL Party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to retire on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because so far many of their members have spoken against a majority of Technocrates, which form Monti.
Parliament's support
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to its efforts or the delays of reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exercises with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, too pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurs associations, as well as with youth and women organisations.
The meeting round is supposed to be completed on Tuesday.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who launched an extremely rapid change in government in response to the crisis.
After short breathing at the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would withdraw, because of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs for the Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
A salvation of Italy with a government debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering the elections.
Monti said that he would like to take politicians into his cabinet, but the large parties are insisting that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in the light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more play situations than the Ticos
From 22 players from Spain, ten more than 50 international games are on the bubble.
From Costa Rica's pages, only one of the 22 invited has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica, when the 22 for the friendship game that takes place today at the National Stadium of San José is compared with each other.
While the world and Europe champion, the number one on the monthly ranking of the FIFA, can look back to a considerable number of selection games of Class A, the three-colored team has only the defence player Michael Umana as the only with more than 50 international games.
He reached this number on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Champions) as well as high-level Europe Cups like the Champions League.
In addition, experiences with the Spanish Furie come in complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships.
The Tico footballers, however, have a few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA track list below.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached a equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Degradation 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from the UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian crew who had reached the magic number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle towers of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also close to Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61, and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side storm Junior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five to over 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36, and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games show in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From sides of the national team, at less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even close to the 20s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson haven't had their debut yet.
The historical gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett took Costa Rica to his tour to celebrate his 20-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that fulfills"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts on the next Sunday at the national stage.
More than 20 years were expected, but the band assured that when they play in Costa Rica, a dream would come true for them.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its 20-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will appear at the National Stadium at 19.30 a.m. together with the Band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an extract from the conversation whose complete copy can be found in the online release of La Nación.
When Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica, you know what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that will also come true for us.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and until now it has been great.
I've only been for a holiday in Costa Rica once. It's a so beautiful country that we'll probably stay there a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you that because the fans of the band are completely dedicated, they experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We spent almost 21 years until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting for so long and we're sorry to have needed as long as we have come here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that exert some pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in São Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unprecedented.
My friends have always traveled to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the outstanding areas are for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we have learned about it.
With a view to the tour, you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we don't set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile stocking.
You never repeat your stock.
Why?
I think that is partly so because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we will play will not be easy.
If we take up two or three songs that we haven't played anymore, we can better keep our concentration upright and surprise us because they call us the reasons to remember why we liked these songs. Otherwise they might forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year story.
If you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that no one of us has imagined to play in a great rock band, and that also for over 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and we find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like and are excited to produce music.
We're lucky to travel to the places of the world that we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have participated actively in the birth hour of the grunge?
It has always been a honor to be part of this group of large bands.
We're good friends with the people of Sound Gardens, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement appears from a group of friends.
A band emerges from a city from time to time, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound yards on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and honor us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands remain.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate the happiness of being alive and also care for each other.
We are all close friend, why musical ways have opened, giving each individual the freedom to experiment.
One is familiar with the other and his music.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We're sure not to be too often on tournae, because it's too easy to fall this game with huge people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come because of music, this reminds you that you have to take care of the music and what they have created in life, without being a famous rock star. This has never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have written very good songs and at first it was great.
For three years, we were a band that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed about having needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the band with us. When I hear a song or pictures, I think about what an incredible man Andy was and how he led me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band therefore chose to open?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and this band liked us best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that is in him.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
Of so many+
Among the first ones I agree to include Geeser Butler, John Diswistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all do not feel very linked to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all others who came up at the same time, I find it great today, because it is worth listening to these music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work slightly easily. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard how Ed played them. It's very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family or a friend - that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, informed his house doctor.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is retained for 25 years of violation of human rights during his reign period (90-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operational and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress member and his personal doctor, said to the TV that Fujimori would be investigated for three days at the Peruan hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be admitted for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish this because he thought he was innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood blood problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori is located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía prison since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death swedron of the Peruan army, which was in secret during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official appointment, given by the Uruguese President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between both countries and discuss the political issues of the region
The next Wednesday, Mujica meets with his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón. This, according to the Uruguese President, will be the climax of his planned date with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the colleague of the Uruguayian living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website announced.
According to local media, Mujica seeks support for Calderón as regards the incident with France, when the French Head of Government Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 Summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his debate, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still appear as a tax paradise from the international community, which were rejected by Uruguay and led to a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group consisting of the most powerful thresholds and industrial countries in the world. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to prevent double destruction with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the concertion of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be deleted from the 'graw list' of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries which have not introduced all international standards for tax cooperation.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to the growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snorrly installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years, Super Mario has struggled for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil Bowser, but never yet in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the stores of all the world this month has been cut from the beginning to the properties of the tragic console Nintende 3DS, with which without a special glass can be played three dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning" because success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelta: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments were already existing titles.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that even though it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D country" is a "available" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less gifted users.
Afterwards, experts on the various levels of play, which becomes more and more difficult, can turn a "second round".
In real time, users can also choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome the obstacles, without becoming victims of the "optical effects", however, it is always necessary to play three dimensions.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a tragic console, which has no longer been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twinkers the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last expenditure: The snorrly installer must overcome spectacular platforms with dangers in order to liberate the princess Peach.
However, the player finds news about movements, the environment, clothes and enemies - and a "playable" luigi.
Colom bores for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would be delivered by former governor Alfonso Portillo in order to be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy of $70 million money laundering.
Thus, the case on the United States' application for portillo delivery ends so that it can be brought before the court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that during his government he did not intervene in court decisions and took place all the delivery requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action of Coloms is a government act which is carried out when all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to condemn the former President of State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Guatemala Constitutional Court, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is cleared in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Defence Ministry during his reign period. This negotiation preceded the delivery, but the Minister inflicted contradiction and revived the case.
Trinyove has helped 6000 young people who are threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was called for to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinyove Social Assistance Organization have resulted in important results: In this quarter of the century, 6000 young people were supported by socially threatened people to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the more than 100 jobs created for this social group will come.
During the anniversary, an event in the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats, over 300 people attended, was balanced yesterday.
Trinyove was launched in 1986 in the city district of Trinitat Vella with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
On the yesterday celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible bodies and institutions who have worked with the association in these 25 years participated.
The participation of political representatives from different directions to election times proved the inpartiality of the work done by Trinyove.
In addition to the President of the Generality (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his former Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former Mayor and currently left-green city council Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the present Catalonian Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinyove was introduced in very difficult times and that today’s times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President of the Generality, Trinyove is an example that is a good example of combating difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
Occupied house in which giant parties were organised was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 at Balmes Street have found an end.
At last afternoon, twelve people voluntarily left the building that they held illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
The door lock was exchanged to avoid a similar situation.
"From now the accession will be controlled," confirmed the house manager.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of the building were inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water supply. They also had painted the walls and left all types of waste, especially boxes with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge festivals were celebrated, which took up to two days and drew the tenants to despair.
Besides the building, there is a disothek, Balmes 51, which also had damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, declared Europe Press that her business had declined by 80% since the beginning of the house occupation.
The owners of the Discothek pointed out that the household owners made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
In addition, the owner of the recreational area was shown by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while, according to her statement of noise, not by the visitors of the Disco, but by the housekeepers, and especially by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the argued neighbors, became increasingly longer and longer in recent weeks.
Discothek's responsibility explained that the disadvantage had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Citizen Police) also confirmed that she has received more complaints from neighbors in recent weeks.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) at the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week to clear the building immediately and to handle the problems of civic coexistence and the descendation of the city district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but that in the last few months the housekeepers had been in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, it had even come to diets.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to criminality and to intervene against the Asian acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the city district of Nou Barris was cleaned by the Catalonian police.
At 15:30 the police approached the street Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, except for the disputes on the honouraries.
The city tender on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the peak of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) disappeared, this administration published its shameful writing on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in figures to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again to the uppermost of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few who are not spread in north-south direction, but to the top (bergs) and down (mer).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
As a model, the Central Park was no longer served, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, it was for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or somebody intends to put gates on the ground.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The tender is not only from an organizational perspective, but also in view of a reflection on the city, the theme of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recursive topic to which two members of this oldly inmated box, which meets in elevator, can take place.
And exactly this fact offers the substance for one of the rare consensus between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have acquired the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" to talk after attacking the coast about the "Front on the mountains" in so far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples.
"You should assume that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it's accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical case": it must not be imagined as access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to which it needs to be handled."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal to be a " intellectual challenge" which poses "a number of dangers".
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" following the experiences from the 1980s that had their "swane songs" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own restriction to what can be built.
"Limiting something always means to set the next step," that is, to cross it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [referencing to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who keeps closer to the question, means simplifying the side of Collserola, who goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not in the direction of Barcelona" for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola that should not "suspend deaf ears," although he was grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
He also notes that the nearness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter, which enables architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubts about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams (exactly the right, he says) that "We architects should be just a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question is complex in the headline of this article, since the tendering conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 cross-section competitions," he says, "on the axis mountain-mere. But there are no long-section perspectives that view the area in its entirety."
This at least in his case led to his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gate would conflict with that of the architect of the gate.
He believes that the city should ensure that the stripes are equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the empowered of the Casino Red liberated the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process that is led against him because of suspected extortion.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the advocate of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the second court of the district, which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the Attentat at the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is seen, which suspectly forces him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the competition house.
After the warrant, the prosecution opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, arrested on September 2, for 30 days.
After four hours with the Ministry of Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 at the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
There he remained 49 days after a second arrest order after the official of the Ministry of Público had rejected crimes for bribes and organised crimes.
On October 19th, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he probably had bribed the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the middle security tract, as murder threats posed against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an assassin of the San Nicolás de los Garza city prison.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, issued an arrest regulation to him, noting that, after almost two months of investigation, there were sufficient evidence to blame Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Competitive House in order to open this in return.
This Monday, the author of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, to give the mayor's brother the punishment, so he will be put free in the next few hours.
During the judicial hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had resolved the damage and which of the owner of the competition house had forgiven, but the lawyer kept the name back.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is spoken freely. Even the following cannot be objected to the process, nor is any replacement required.
After hearing the Advocate of the Competition at 15.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately put on the free foot.
The judicial secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolás de los Garza's urban prison to tell Jonás that he had been released and that his case was placed to the documents.
He also informed him of the judicial arrangement for immediate release.
The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome has announced details about the plane accident at which government secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation about the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons were killed, pointed out that the helicopter with its entire unprecedented structure was punished directly against the ground without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport, stated that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for flights.
"The fact that the propellers had contact with trees at 25 meters height, whereas the helicopter lost the rub, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of staff.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the field where the machine had come down.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found in other places, the lookup concerns the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area shows a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to obtain the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and aid services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of Estado Mayor Presidential had flooded at a flight speed and the plane had fallen on a soft deck.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of the incidence it was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility speed:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient sight during the flight and on the ground.
Weighting conditions:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds were drawn up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Pushing point:
The co-ordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. It may have not been a loss of control over the plane or a deviation from the flight route before the collapse.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to this date indicates that the helicopter was strolled straight and sidely.
The pattern of the scattered airplane resistance suggests that the helicopter was strolled on the ground with its unprecedented structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer at the accident site do not stop on fire or on explosion.
The final results of the investigation indicate several soil contacts.
In the local investigations, airplane parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The area is absurd and shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence where the helicopter probably has broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minusive search in an area that went beyond the blocked area at the accident site, no divided parts of the aircraft could be found, which strengthens the assumption that the unprecedented aircraft structure was pumped against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for fat liability
It leads a research project to find the gene for fatness in children and adolescents supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is a research project for discovering the gene for fat liability in children and adolescents under the title "Genetic of fat liability in childhood and youth" to find genetic brands associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Directive for Medical Research, Priority Biochemistry) at the Clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that a interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students from the post-graduated study course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interesting parties can come to the IMSS sports places in the Mexico Valley, where every Saturday tests are carried out with children and adolescents.
He emphasized that the investigation started at the scene of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of México) and has been continued on the Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the target is reached from 500 to 600 investigators, the study is continued at the sports site of Inependencia (south of the capital district) and completed by Morelos ( north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn the factors and the role of genetics in the development of fatness and identifying risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the global day of diabetes, he declared that three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 years of age should fill in food-related questionnaires with consent and under the supervision of their parents.
They are also asked about their physical activity and their family history to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or renal impairment.
He further reported that on the above Saturdays the investigators (weight, size, size, size), their blood pressure controlled, and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (experience of genes related to fatness in childhood) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the grounds of the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight increase of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the proportion of fat boys has increased by 77 per cent and the girls with fatness by 47 per cent. Overweight has also increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He argued that the search for genetic brands was founded because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from the other peoples.
He argued that an (e) Mexican (in) averages 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African derivatives, reflecting the genes related to diabetes and overweight.
Generally, he explained that the genetics of fatness are incapable of burning out the surplus of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher stated that the direct benefit for the investigators was in a comprehensive study of the children in which it would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or fat liability.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and in the interior arm (acanthose), indicating the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all measuring results and suggest them changes in the lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors responsible for overweight, fatness and other chronic diseases: the lack of movement in everyday life, that is to say lack of movement, spending most of the time of the day before the TV and using means of transport rather than walking short ways to walk.
The high calorie recording, that is, increased consumption of glucose and hydrocarbons (Tamales, Brot, Pizza, Hamburger, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt of UNAM prevents holes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM developed polymerized asphalts to make the mix more resistant to the conditions of heating and temperature variations
If the signs resulting from the road surgery, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 holes when the rainfall time in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (the city area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the University of UNAM, warned and assured that if the interpretation and maintenance of the asphalt stock were adequate, the number of holes would be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Slagholes from technical perspective", which he held on the basis of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrra Najera believed that this kind of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road stock and thus avoid the appearance of holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon link of which one part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called maltene. Together, they give the road stock its characteristic countlastic behavior.
Asphalt's tealastic behaviour means that it acts at high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid, at 120°C it is very county and almost fixed at 50°C, while it becomes broken at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not equal, but changes on one day in dependency on the conditions and temperature variations," the chemical engineer conducted.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a large majority of a flexible road cover, which consisted of six material layers, including the last three asphalts.
Between the upper layers, there is a slide layer of asphalt, which is bathed from small, asphalt and then consists of solid stones.
Each single stone of this sleeve was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on and forces are produced, this layer allows a good distribution of power in the streets.
"If it was modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," said the chemical engineer.
"About the slice layer," he concluded, "the last layer is designed, which is so-called cargo layer consisting of small stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in Asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle mats, they need a greater mechanical power than the sliding layer and it has to produce refinement.
It also requires a proper thickness and the material from which it consists to be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and temperature variations, are further, important factors to be taken into consideration, above all the things the water," he said, "for it significantly affects the behavior of the sliding layer.
When the terrain is moist, water penetrates into the layer and comes out difficultly again. This causes a rise of all the layers of the road coating and consequently the occurrence of holes.
When a slaughter hole arises," he said, "it will first be carried off the cover layer while the sliding layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programmes at the first signs."
The member of the Lastema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of holes. Therefore, the thickness of any layer of the road stock must always be relative to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that to avoid frequent holes this scheme is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research was still waiting, e.g. about asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, and with which the holes were easily repaired and without applying high temperatures.
What was missing by the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez had to satisfy Serna with standing on the winner podium, a silver crown and the band that she shows as new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the ceder, the department has already joined the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in hands. Among the proclamated misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many today ask is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite woman who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing, she was elected to the queen of the police and to Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that also had received the beauty kings of Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the jury's decision to appoint it to the first Miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has affected you most and why?" which was put by Martín Murillo Gomez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in the literature, I think it is a way to civilize itself, finally I think that the book that was the strongest for my childhood, 'The little Prince' is a very deeply walking book.
At present I read `Schuld und Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm just reading a book from Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that'Leitenschaften'hearts.
A reply that stood on little companion love, first of all because of the term 'civilising' and second, because she had not explained specifically how each of her books had influenced it.
But after the ceremony was completed, Melina declared to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred, all the adventures that had received in front of all prices (Gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand-covered costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealous what the Queen stressed, which therefore could not shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at their first show in the bathing suit at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two elevators at the crown celebration.
Though she was sure of both, she lacked the power and vibration of Magdalena and Atlantico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" programme at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned to miss "does show that the candidate who wins most prices during competition will not even become queen."
In addition, Valle went away from the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury regarding its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of national beauty competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained that they were looking for a woman who was engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You need to look beyond the body and focus on social feelings, that she had worked on the competition in projects before taking part," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis that was observed in the abdominal area. But this is inconsistent, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good diet habits and responsible physical work.
The practitioner of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body that was better, "but her problem with the fibrose at the abdomen, which was honestly hard to notice for me, pressed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgery that she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay it."
Because of this price, which is for the first time forgiven by the National Beauty Competition, a horrible prediction was created after the appearance in the bathing suit. Raymundo Melina was drought to give a comfort price to not let her come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is coming to her reign year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent at the appointment of the national beauty competition in Colombia at one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the Queens, who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, will enter the crown in history.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last 4 November, a Lophoskopist of the Detection Unit of State Advocates (CTI) from Cali was the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armies of Colombia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had served ready, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he seated over and after completion of the necessary courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to rips, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of action against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
On Friday night, he fled in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was supposed to identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla of the world could be his. Therefore he should take the ten-finger print paper of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because it was similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was dressed like a farmer of the area, weared no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the Chief of the FARC.
Trailing
For a daccyloscoop from Sijín in Cali, the rating given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the action against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The daccyloscopy is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopics not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false certificates or they do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to rip a piece of wall out of a house at a steal, because the thief had stood up with his hand exactly on this place when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are not suitable for removing fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thefts," he remembered.
With the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be discharged or loaded.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by sleeve bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he will be linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A daccyloscopyer of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a tape is used to take them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or the personnel office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification documents," explained the expert of the CTI.
He said it wasn't all the way it was represented in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold that shines is not all that you touch is a fingerprint.
Yet, it can be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "employment" demands the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed together in tents on the Zuccotti place.
A large majority came to the clearing order and changed its location to a nearby park.
The members of Ocupy Wall Street called on the authorities of New York on this Tuesday when they tried to enter the Manhatten place again with a court order after they had been removed from the place in the morning grey and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators forced themselves together before the Zuccotti place, on which they had a court order that allowed the "employed" to enter the new tent at this place. At the same time, another part of the movement remained on the hiring order and occupied a park further north of the city where there was nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray argued that the answer of the "employers" to the removal of her tent camp, which had been directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came before the court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the violent rumulation of the place and approved the demonstrations the tent.
In addition, the "employed" occupied a new park located at the crossing of the centrally located Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entrance of the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but after that, the police came in and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't give precise numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he also saw several journalists with handcuffs below.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had been found in this place, where a organization of religious leaders had also arrived as signs of their support for the members of movement and to interfere with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti spot (a private property area) remains closed in expectation of a judge hearing which is still held for this Tuesday and where the legitimacy of the rooms found in the morning grey is to be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators who were driven from the place carried photographs of this judicial order with themselves and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who watched the place, which resulted in "a few small collisions", as Bray reported, who had shown that some police had hit demonstrators.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of the Occupy Wall Street from the seat and the application of "sets adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the return of demonstrators to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg makes clear to the press that the reopening of the place for public transport and the demonstrations has been re-opened because of this judicial arrangement. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set themselves up again with tents and sleep sacks in this place.
The mayor personally defended the space of the Zuccotti place, where almost 200 people were arrested, and it was decided because the demonstrators "refused the right".
Bloomberg declared that he had given the order to remove the place because it had "converted into a place where people did not demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses would have received threats" and the inhabitants feared "of their quality of life".
"The rooming in the morning grey was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement that accused the mayor to "not respect the freedom of press".
The responsibles of "Occupy Wall Street" informed them that they were thinking of organising "great actions" for Thursday, together with communal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests took since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian famouss, it will appear on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbits at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of Canadian television.
Today, the private TV channel CTV announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will occur on December 1st in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will raise a very special virgin Mary's life.
Today, CTV spread pictures of the TV program in which Anderson - also for the distribution on the Internet of a self-wrong porn, in which she appears as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shoe that Jesus is supposed to represent - as the "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee.
In the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian origin, recently worked as a moderner at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen as Jesus' child.
The CTV Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singers Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and which is not far away from this controversy.
On one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American lady Kim Kardashian "Hur".
Japan is reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, which was still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which was in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced was World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage of the matter to $300,000, a struggle that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters, the gross domestic product data from July to September were used to finalise this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota calculated to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained partly by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared with the decrease by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decrease after six months of unstoppable increase.
Nevertheless, the real conversion of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which is currently 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, affected by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and recreational employment.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo relyed on the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - escaped into one of the "refuge currencies" of investors who, before the debt crisis of the euro area and the forecasts for U.S.A., are a privilege that is a grave stone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a tougher currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September to the notation of the Yen.
While the markets continue to beat the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains alert.
"You must take care of the continuing risks, such as the worsening of some foreign economies, the effects of flooding in Thailand and the rapid revaluation of the Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that in September, most Member States had shown clear signs of delaying economic development.
The indicator that predicts the turning points of the world economy showed that in the largest economic potential, the brakes had been pulled.
Because he dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average value, which is 100 after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos says that saving measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread insecurity, Greece continues to mislead into the labyrinth that results from the large European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly demonstrated by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Nueva Democracia Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and would not at all withdraw his demand for new elections at the planned date, on 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its climax with the confidence of the new government tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes for employment promotion, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax restraint are the first initiatives.
Yet Samara's communication does not remove doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader went too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism, which must unlock the 8000 million that are urgently needed for Athens, and made it clear that he would not approve a commitment declaration on the fulfilment of savings measures.
However, the European Commission, who is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that it would not be necessary to refrain from its demand: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would "not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of the Troika would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knee still has for a while.
Queen Sophia: "This are instruments for progress and hope"
The queen emphasized the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position worldwide in the role of small funding".
The Queen Sophia of Spain reminded yesterday that Spain has developed in the last two decades the second donor for this means of international cooperation. Its "Wesen" relies on the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of confidence in humans".
The Queen was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" in order to achieve the millennium goals drawn by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with income from less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "armout limit".
Spain continues to work on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world, and it is responsible for this task," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit that lasts until Thursday will "create new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" are guaranteed as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "have faced many challenges."
The Summit on Small Credits is not only a forum for debates but also a platform for "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen declared that it was aimed for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would exceed the poverty limit.
The conception of small credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world to the path "initiated by Muhammad Yunus years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described it as a "adorable idealist who has described herself to fight poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the lending strategy on site.
One year later, this experience followed the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have been able to observe a continual development," the Queen whose commitment to this project put in her opinion yesterday as "family head" in Valladolid and as "preacher of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it is a mistake to bind development aid to times of economic trees, as it is a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that the minor credit is a "hard and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states now have to work "more than ever" in accordance with solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be victims.
For Spain, small credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "standing always in front of closed doors" "hopping" and opening up the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city, which "their gates, which are established by the Spirit of Solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU presidents due to general voting
The first day of the Christian Democrats Congress (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, left for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not planned in the programme, but it has been implemented in the autumn, especially in order to give enough to those activists who consider government policy with regard to the Greeks today and perhaps Italy's tomorrow to be too lax.
The Presidential request from the European Commission was almost unanimously adopted by the Bureau.
Under 1001 delegates had voted only nine against, ten had abandoned their voice.
The several minutes of standing Ovation, which was initially covered by Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schüble, was no doubt of the three European Ministers of Finance.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the requests - is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace but also "no million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a strengthening of the control of the European Union of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, as well as by the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote to give Europe a face.
However, this is, in any case, one of the proposals adopted by the Convention, which clearly stated Wolfgang Schüble Pate.
Surely it is little likely that the 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Great Britain is rejecting the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates, in an overwhelming majority, have rejected the proposal for weighting each country in the Governing Board according to the weighting of the individual economics, which obviously involves a reinforcement of the position of Germany.
Thus, the Chancellor, who was planning to reassure the climate within her party, has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her convention at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in trouble which would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request for the importance of the "German-French friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds me that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does the fraud represent in illness reports?
Following family support, the UMP and the government are now taking on the disease reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family aid box and to present a speech on the topic of fighting social fraud and economic dependency from the State - which has always come back since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the struggle to undergo the economy in a hard test, but, on the other hand, is not less prejudice to the axis of the right Presidency campaign, the majority wants to focus on job disease reports.
Firstly, with budgetary economic objectives: the government demonstrates the introduction of a fourth day of carence before taking into account a disease notification to workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the four-day wage without the permit of the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to combat anger, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", would, however, help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the more symbolic character of another measure was used: to grant the officials an unpaid carence day in the case of disease (to date, in contrast to the three carence days in the private sector, there is no deadline for carence).
While these issues are discussed, the majority also emphasizes fraud to the new, aiming at the abuse associated with work abuse.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and they are also refunded when this is required," warned Xavier Berand on Sunday, on 13 November, before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease reports seems a little unproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives that have worn most frequently since 2002.
The French are no more frequently ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first go to the country-wide numbers.
According to CNAM, over 237 million euros were paid daily in 2006.
In 2008, the meetings of the Institute for Economic Research and Documentation of Health represented 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% as regards maternity leave as well as work accidents and 54% as regards disease leaves, which amounted to €6.2 billion.
Thus, 2.5% of health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, only 14.5 days of sickness were allowed to the French compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
A medium value that distinguishes certain differences: another, published by Monster.com, website for career planning, in 2007, showed that 75% of the 40,000 inquired, reported French workers, had not taken a single day of sickness.
Another study this time covered by health insurance reveals that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with their European neighbours, therefore, the French workers tend not to work incapacity anywhere else.
A long-term study conducted by two researchers from the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absence rate (crank or otherwise founded) was oscillated in France between 10% and 11% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% in the Netherlands and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in illness reports represents a disappearing small proportion of black work.
As regards fraud, there is only a weak exam.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM (public university for the training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285 000 realized short-term disease reports, which were in 37.050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the systematically controlled disease reports of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which were 132.000.
Overall, this makes 169 000 "unjustified" cases of several million workers who have claimed a disease report.
A number that represents only a weak exam, for example, to those of black work.
According to the UMP department of Dominique Tian, the author of a case report on this issue in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax gains per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus considerably more than the defraudation in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced to Parliament that the government of the Union had not given a hundred days to do this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to reinforce the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," explained the Head of Government in his first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence voting on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area was at stake, as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the state deficit of the country'um 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and in 2009 at 15.7%.
Rights reject the new Sparma
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his consent to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be willing to accept additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his Party of Members.
He had declared himself ready with the rules for reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as to combat waste, but any policy that would undermine economic growth was opposing.
Olli Rehn, responsible for economic and monetary tasks, EU Commissioner, who had prevented IMF and the EU from giving the necessary loans over EUR 8 billion without written guarantee to all parties on their support for the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign under pressure by Auβen.
Euthanation and accompanying free death must be legalised, so an expert body
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as shown in a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The body stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors were working together in the field of painful treatment to provide the best painful means, and this also exceeds cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually invited to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government change the criminal law suchly in order to allow accompanying suicide and Euthanation where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a record, experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earthball.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to crop the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painstillers, reports the experts ordered by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of them die at the hospital.
From all over the country, the rate of 86% of deaths encountered in the hospital in Quebec is the highest.
With regard to Euthania and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions which are contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already raised, to make no changes to the criminal law on Euthania and accompanying suicide.
However, according to experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach to Euthanation and accompanied suicide has legalized or discriminated, there is no evidence that such discrimination would draw Miβ practices in their application, i.e. the implementation of Euthanation or accompanied suicide by uncompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are considerably more cases of such violations in the countries where Euthanation and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, the competitor of the report, confirmed yesterday at a tele conference.
"Euthanation is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Auch accompanying suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian Promotes Euthanation
Consider that, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already taken place in favour of Euthanation, since they believe that they allow people to relieve their sufferings at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalisation of the Euthanation does not result in the message that the life of older or disabled people has less value.
With regard to those who have already practiced a accompanied suicide, the respondents believe 41% that they should not be persecuted in criminal law.
As regards maintaining or setting up the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they point out in their recommendation list that the criminal law should indicate that the discontinuation of the funds for which a legal rejection has been made should not be considered criminal.
The expert body also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a discontinuation of the funds at the end of life and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The body stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated in the field of painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, and this is beyond cancer.
Lastly, as regards the medicines already used in the Canadian institutions for healthcare, the body calls for pain relieving or life-releasing measures to consider them at least, as they were as little as the Euthanation used to reduce physical pain and to retract them to the same procedures.
Reservation of other experts
Some experts in the field of health have already presented reservations regarding the conclusions of the Expert Report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the attitude of the reporting experts, among other things, "extreme", since they do not set any limits to the Euthanation Practice in the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the patches for a situation where everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years asks another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility above all other values involved in the social community of the society.
But, he says, there would be "guides and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "pro-euthanation-manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports concerning the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthania and accompanying suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to the power resignation
Damascus pragmatics a "complott"
Syria is more isolated
The Partizanes Bazar al-Assads demonstrated before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry yesterday.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Bashar al-Assads, which, thanks to the support of Russia and a "complot" aimed against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion through the Arab Liga, the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken position in favour of a departure from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. Last yesterday, the official Arab Prime Minister, who had invited President Bashar al-Assad to do so, was from Jordan to Syria, in which about 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country, he would depart from it, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Head of Diplomats Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that the Turkish intermediary attempts that have been addressed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have not been crowned by success.
"The ones in the Middle East, who are not in peace with their people and cannot satisfy this, must go," he said in announcement to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a constantly roaring attitude.
On the other hand, the United States welcomed the "supercut of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime" as a result of the Arab Liga and the European Union's decisions.
"International Community, the United States, the EU, Arab Liga and countries like Turkey have hit a increasingly tightening tone in view of the repressions in Syria," says Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH announced.
Two more civilians, according to this NGO, had killed Jobar in the city of Hom.
At a press conference, the Syrian Auβen Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim was still of the opinion that the country was "governing to the end of the crisis".
In addition, he stressed the decision of the Arab Liga to suspend Damascus from his tasks, which represents his assessment after a "hazardous step".
Syria "were not surrender," he added, "the complots that were slaughtered against Syria would fail."
Following Syria's suspending decision, the Arab Liga is currently investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers into the country.
The French Auβen Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also expressed himself in favour of the dispatch of UN observers in order to stand side-by-side civilians against the repressions of the regime, that he was locked up in his "Paranoia".
An auβerplanetaire re-communication of the Liga is planned for tomorrow in discount to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November for a rise in crisis, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the inhabited cities and the exemption of prisoned demonstrants.
The Russian Auβen Minister Sergej Lawrow considered the decision of the Arab Liga to be "incorrect" yesterday to guard against any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to offer sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian Head of Government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and to implement a programme that requires "sacrifice" to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today's meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to call a cabinet into Parliament, which consists relatively strictly of external technocrates.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the many smaller, participating parliamentary groups after meeting with the President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had waited for Mario Monti to put a confidence voting to Parliament until Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will be summarised in the presentation presented by M. Monti of a list of strokes, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that the yesterday's nervousness of the stock markets and obligation markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed the fact that it is "safe that the markets will prove themselves clear and understandable".
The President's order was greeted at the beginning of the markets, but the disturbance had increased again, especially after an unexpected decrease in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The President-in-Office of the Prime Minister was to set up a staff consisting of mainly technocrates, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence certificate until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed to working in all urgency in the sense of the aim of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman of Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that our diagnosis of the Italian economy, even taking into account the new government, does not change.
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the saving plans taken in these last months, has in particular requested new challenges.
Emma Marcegaglia "Chapter of the Chiefs" of Italy, who will meet on Monti on Tuesday, is also on the need for economic encouraging" that a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficitary identifiers."
M. Monti, known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "epoche change" of Italy after 17 years "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "requirement of trustworthiness" and a "other Italy", says the leaders.
The biggest unknown is the long-standing life of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, since Italy has now arrived for 200 billion euro bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a bomb capsule used with a nuclear weapon, a nuclear NGO specialized in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report published by the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents issued by this UN Agency for the detection of this scientist.
Last week the AIEA had announced its "reasonable concern" due to a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the in-depth study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, seemed to have worked in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades and was involved in the synthetic diamonds produced by the production of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is supposed to have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev, which produces "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian message in the Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA's strong indications that the Iranian development of a nuclear bomb system was supported by the work of a foreign expert, who was not only the first in this technology, but also, as a member of the Agency informed, has worked his entire professional career on this technology directly at the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Islam crimes and delicates have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have decreased slightly or have only increased slightly during the same period.
According to these data, the total number of crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas 13% of violence against Catholics, a 4% decline against Jews, and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes had been observed.
The total number of "hass-founded crimes" has increased in very weak Maβe to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of crimes motivated by the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights Organization first stressed the increase in anti-Islam violence," the organization added in a Communication.
"Human Rights First had long time over stressing that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be regarded as a serious legal rule against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsible of the organization.
"The U.S. Government can and should do more to combat these crimes," he supplemented that this could be carried out by improving the political attitude toward the "hass crime".
The "hass crime" is represented in American federal law as an inheritance from the epoch of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion or descendant, and now also involve crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter walks the platform and is more and more like Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in order to allow its users to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another "Name" enable better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet user whose messages you follow and track your messages.
This makes it possible to determine whether they are allowed to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new contributions, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested with a small percentage of users before its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August", Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner announced before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, with something esotherically encouraging words (RT for the referencing repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre and autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiatives, s'ouvre ainsi a and public plus large avec and maniement plus comparable a celui desréseaux grand Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via the Internet using certain "Tweets".
"This is useless, urgent and equals too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Function" Activity will help me to track certain elements of my flux-twitters better," declared @dannykron stream.
Austria
Inclusion of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficiencies and also avoid any degradation of rating agencies in Austria's top Bonity (AAA).
It was the social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian government debt is 74.6%, thus far above the criterion of 60%, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment ability was not reduced to a hit from AAA+ to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros additional interests each year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Cancel and Christian Democratic Auβen Minister.
Austria also requires the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would at that time have required the receipt of the reduction of public deficit by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance into the Constitution or by adopting a similar law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had incorporated such a "regulation" into the Constitution.
By 2017, the Structural Budget Deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of GDP (BIP) each year, and from 2017 the Structural Budget Deficit of the Federal State should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, while regional states should have balanced households as well as the municipalities.
The aim is to eliminate budget debt under the 60% criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the Horizon of 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
On Tuesday, the Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned that the Japanese government would intervene again on the monetary markets if the Yen should continue to rise.
"If we find excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene as we have done the last time," explained M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was near the historical levels forced by the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On this day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which is about to control a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
However, the yen has grown regularly over it, baptized by purchases from investors who view the Yen as the "refuge value" in these uncertain times of world economy decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro was cast under the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that the last intervention had triggered.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded about 120 Yen, the euro more than 160 Yen.
This Stroh Fire of the Japanese Devis damages the exports of the Archipelago, as it devours the costs of the "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as these exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami that destroyed the region of Tohoku (Nord-East) on 11 March for its reconstruction," M. Noda, who fears that this explosion of the Yen can kill the weak rise already in the room.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter of -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time in this year, has recycled the rise in exports and the consumption of the "plombed" households in the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the explosion of the Yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
On the other hand, the Minister for Finance Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all the memorial measures to defend the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Vice-President of the Institute, has informed the BoJ that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures" to make it clear that no additional currency locking was expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its national bond purchases by 5.000 billion Yen (EUR 47 billion) in order to abolish the 55.000 billion Yen (EUR 519 billion) coverage amounts that it had used for various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet speed up to height, stock exchanges make backs
The incentive risk of the debt crisis continues to undermine the European identification numbers.
Despite the emergence of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weak countries continue to rise.
The stock exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro area, also run off this Tuesday, on 15 November, a little more in negative filled.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 1.4% at 10:00 and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions relating to the yields of national bonds in the euro area in difficulties, the global share markets continue to give out part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only conscious of the incentive risk," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG markets, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The stock exchanges in Tokyo, which suffered from the re-frighting of market participants with regard to Europe's capacity that the debt crisis continued to last, had closed with a lot of 0.7%.
""Japan has, as the rest of the world, focused its eyes on Europe, and trade moves to a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence of the stability of the situation," estimates Mitschushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This revival of concern about the future of the euro area damages the unit currency that continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 p.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it gave up by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange makers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the assembly on Monday, had made an application that in particular provides for the possibility of leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The borrowing interests of Italy and Spain continue to be at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian obligations reached 6.85% to 10 years, which grew up to 6.2% of Spanish titles.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian government head Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by lamb by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, as the elections of Parliament will take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest rates ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds have reached a new historical height once again.
In expectation of growth rates in the euro area
Statistically, France booked an economic growth of 0.4% by household consumption in the third quarter, was a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the baisses of the numbers of the second quarter, with a minority of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that is most disturbed by economic experts.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first bill of the whole euro area is expected at 11 a.m. and the EU Commission warns against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogs
If there is a topic that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affect the purchase power and competitiveness of companies in direct Maβe.
It is reasonable to take an electoral meeting to start, consider this topic and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only produce fruit if it transmitts the overall economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, demographic evolution is leading to a doubled demand for electricity by 2050, a huge proportion of the world’s population should not be dismissed from a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the shortcoming of fossil resources in order to continue producing electricity without the necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate, to be forgotten to combat climatic irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to abstain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which undermines its decision on the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which is just intended to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name only some countries, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
On the other hand, the United States decided to split their park with another unit by restarting the work of the Three Mile Island that was put down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model, oriented to renewable energy sources, is sometimes represented as a model, however, the reality is contrary to the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a dilution of the electricity price, an increase in energy dependency in particular on Russia, a increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The total of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European table leader on wind energy, from which it accounts for 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternatingly used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account compared to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability of industry on national grounds, French companies benefit from the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of buying power to illusion.
Inquiries showed that this is a price that the large majority of the French are willing to pay as little as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Consider that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induction jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a variety of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them create numerous jobs.
If France took the decision to get out of nuclear power, a large part of these SMEs would be victim to it, and the annual EUR 6 billion of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would be increasingly shrinking.
If the fall of its producer is preprogrammed, what electrician would be an EPR designed to work for 60 years?
To solve the energetic equation, you have to admit that there is as little a miracle for the production of electricity as well as a devil work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by the Areva company for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy demonstrate the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the maximum level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France we have a security authority that has carried out compromiseless and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction of Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have made themselves a name because of their professionality, are currently occupied by the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disorders.
Only one, which is located in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so he left without consequences for human and environmental.
In Chernobyl the drama was encouraged by reactor construction and infinite human failure.
At Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters that never existed, which caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it had done after the two previouss.
As the fruit of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and constructors of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which allows it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable to build a nuclear power plant among the electric engineers, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading free railways to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is vital and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogs and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that is equally economic, social and financially determined in our country.
Is immigration load or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from a variety of angles - overloading of police, court and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself described.
Recently, the disturbance against foreign students by the authorities had affected the weekly views, the Minister of Interior had announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France had no need for talents, Maurer or Kellner from abroad.
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
In this regard, there is a widespread consensus between the right and the left.
From the right side, the sound of Jacques Chirac, which in 1976 explained that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigration workers, would not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, "can not take up France's entire poverty in the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of major mobility
The fear of the invasion of the national soil was divided both from the right and from the left in 2005.
Both camps saw immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in the degree of large mobility that is to be admitted to immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited to banalities in his programme which point out that partnership development allows us to resolve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on the choices, but it is economically expensive.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present us in a recently published work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive influence of immigration flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the emigration countries.
Restricting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to substitute local workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are truly much more complementary than local wage workers, since they are exercising major jobs in sectors which are unexhausted technically.
The poorly qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers are less traveling, more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not compatible with the work offer.
Positive wage effect
Similarly, as a surgeon would have difficulties in working in a country in which there is a lack of anaesthetics, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and national labour market situation between indigenous and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigration flow leads to an inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation and economic growth of immigrants brought by the immigrants is compassionate (higher share of indigenous immigrants among American Nobel Prizeholders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute netly to social systems, approximately 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that, at the age of 30, an immigration person to Germany spends an average net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to introduce the missing cutpoints "with the teeth" at his mandate.
These declared teeth, which should distract the immigrants, however, achieved precisely the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remaining to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had taken place throughout the 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some would have believed that it was abundant to exercise the right of vote, in the best possible way to see democracy overcome their enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "to the little one" that it was a feature of mental attitude.
The general election law, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be as well as a "substitute instrument" as it was expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social spirit, a legal procedure.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is a economic crisis, but it is as much and at first political and democracy crisis.
In this regard, the change in mind of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would have had a double insight: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also the ones of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered excessive.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight have moved today and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized in depending on the needs and in the wrong order.
A release for the European sole ruler or a jump with connected eyes into the emptyness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hacked beil, but a collective task, with full law, cleared and constant, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - they do not know where to end the list - since there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is obscuring to the dictate of markets and rating agencies who suffer from its absence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe all that is humiliated at international level.
There is anxiety about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty and thus each of the nations associated with it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
For it is the whole thing that Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and create a future through investment.
The expansion from the crisis has decisions at European level, which cannot be dealt with without total democratic legality, without destructively bringing us to ruin.
After this proposal has been struggled with Jacques Delors and the socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic management.
I agree.
But without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they suggest to the citizens - this would be a new foolishness and another sack gas.
We have to take a new stage of European construction.
In order to make the Republic emerge in France, the fact needed to "create the Republicans".
The revolution of the interests alone could not do enough here.
This teaching continues to be valid.
We must form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general goods
The world fair for chip cards opens their gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most carrying segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or compensation of purchases by simply keeping the map on a reader.
More than the 320 million sold one year before, this year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins on ground with regard to the contactless payment after it has been dependent for a long time in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
Consumer markets, however, make steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have undertaken to provide their customers systematically with bank cards which are equipped with contactless chip in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Test banks Payment by Mobile Phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices has been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) necessary for these transactions.
"They've been in delay."
"But they should get a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell between 80 and 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced the launch of a test run in Caen yesterday, which will expire from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule allowing the contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Genérale had also said yesterday to prepare the marketing of an offer that allows their customers to pay free of contact via a mobile phone.
Terrorist front understands, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the relationship between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Sect of Boko Haram.
The long suspected relationships between the Al-Qaida Terrorist Group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβen Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that algier has now gained certainty about it.
"The way with which both organisations and the relationships of secret services are acting on a clear collaboration," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two French in Niger took place in January.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey, were supposed to have been killed in the following days at the same time as several of their kidnappers in the event of an operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian detectives want to have found several telephone chips that belonged to the terrorists in the drums at the site of use.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of conducted telephone calls leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the detectives are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, who has stayed a veige of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the Sect.
"This is a progress, but you must certainly wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
But it's possible.
"It has been known for years that the Sect relates to financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that it becomes increasingly active," relieves Nigerian researchers Kunle Amuwo.
In these last months, these "supporting services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as well as the speeches and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now point out the use of ever more complex explosives that carry the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to begin with Washington, has since then exercised pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping for a long time as a Community of Illuminates, which must not be given special attention.
Fast Success
The Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school, and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "Western education is a shame" - follows the creation of a Islamic emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this mediumless region, the merger experiences rapid success.
She is politics and claims strict compliance with the Sharia, while the shared activists engage themselves in the fight against the wicked central government.
At first, the activists have churches, bars and authorities in vision.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is differentiated as usual.
The army is surrounded by the city, they count 800 deaths.
The Mohammed Yusuf captive is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its high-burgs in the north.
Last Christmas she confessed to an assault in Jos, who demanded 80 lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is awarded the debt of a suicide arrest that occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the United Nations' local seat has a priority international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been anxious since then to all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé had a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria warned against Boko Harem and showed himself ready to communicate all the indications.
The world of the Republican Presidency candidates
Meeting Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and inconsistency with regard to China, Iraq and Israel.
Can a crisis weak America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican Presidency candidates like this, the voters could get almost that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their contestants have repeatedly made their thundering statements as well as their statements on Auβen policy, traditional republic focus.
Through China, Iran and the Israeli aid - often in no way understood - strikes.
With regard to the designation of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level in the course, Mid Romney threatened Chinese to quote the WTO and to view them as the leading theme of "reward manipulation" in a America, which has been excited by the migration of all industrial branches to Asia.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know what?
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auβen politics, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions.
He had called for a convenient but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obamas' current attitude).
But Huntsman will not be answered because he stagnates in the deepness of the opinion surveys.
Reagan's Similar Image
Romney had also commended military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme should fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm impressing Iran," he had condemned.
"When Obama is reelected, they get the bomb."
He also promised that Israel would have increased military assistance and accused Obama to remain guilty of commitments to this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second highest placed candidate, has a disgraceful documentary recognition.
Recently he called on the Chinese military threat to contra, since Beijing's attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and it seemed to be audienced that China has already been possessing military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is prepared to serve the U.S. army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The reception of torture attacks against mutmaβ terrorists by Obama 2009 was also advocated by Cain, Perry and Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβen policy weight.
The current presidential contradictors, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all this, won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give water in his wine, which was the subject of anti-terror.
They rightly persevere on the failure of his naive conversation with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "young" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
This opposition, however, is not quite so obsolete.
The population rather estimates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has disabled.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to acceptance.
And Obama is more surprised by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to raise his leadership to new life.
North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the sea ground of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly to Russia, has been launched.
It is intended to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to perform this event with glory and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four Heads of State and Government, lived last Tuesday on the East Sea Coast under orchestra sharing and at fine taste buffet the introduction of the new North Stream gas pipeline, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically turned the taxation of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline aims to deliver 27,5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases per year through a first pipeline of 1.224 km, which connects the region of Sankt Petersburg to the Mecklenburg prepommers, to West Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line climb on your own route.
For gasprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge construction works like a victory.
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North-Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any traffic through third countries (Polen or Ukraine) on the road.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little power: for them it will now be more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to conclude access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the most involved in the debate, was not rejected to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the Okcupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
West Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this, at the expense of European energy recovery, since the project has hit a break between West and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, with strong gas consumption and its gas sources.
"This gas transmission is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new species that connects us organically," confirmed François Fillon in the introduction of the gas transmission by pointing out in what degrees the large gas contracts are also important from political and economic aspects.
All of this explains the wide smiles of the Gazprom-Manager, represented in Lubmin, as regards the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete anchorage to protect it from anchors of ships.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m depth.
During their construction, mining fields had to be removed from World War II.
"One hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed carefully," said Jens Müller, spokesman of the Nord Stream Society.
In addition, enhanced measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long snake of metal, hard like 242 eggflakes towers that have been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither through valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned outside Sweden's coast, but the project responsibles have taken advantage of it, since Sweden had little in mind of seeing a Russian state society permanently on their coasts.
"In the case of a havarie we close the gas throughlet in less than a minute," explained Jens Müller.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission is evaporated into the air.
However, this case is considered to be a little likely by the constructors, since the sweats were estimated to be stable by a leak per 100,000 years.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline shall be ensured by a subwater robot controlled by a sea ship for external observation purposes as well as by a device circulating within the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, miβ a meter diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and moves through the gas pressure.
After three full days of continuation through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to be subjected only to the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the accession, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are divided (e.g. 15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group GDF Suez (e.g. 9%).
These five companies have established a company community called North Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas transmission.
It has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented the entire capacity of its gas transport, on the renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how big the real transported amount of gas is", explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was guaranteed to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are sure to recover their explanations, since gasprom alone has the risk of liability.
A sandy coastal line with jaws is located at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4,5 meters high valves form the gas excursion forts.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters Russian gases per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a notebook.
From an Italian company about 15 years ago, Moleskine now wants to bring new styles back to the writing.
It has a flair of adventures, on candle license with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognized again, with its black, rectangular tape, its rubber band, the ovarian sides, as aged over time.
However, the Molecine notebook, as it is known today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided to place a distinct design note book on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's expert advisor, is commissioned to introduce the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin (Mulwurfshaut), which is called a cotton bag, for example used for polster benches.
This type of notebook was very demanded among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has restored an old and almost forgotten item that was considered to be icons of avantgardist artists up to the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand responsible at Modo Modo.
The success will take place.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rise by 26% and are established by a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a fantasy picture of the buyers, as the notebook is enthusiastic to businessmen as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which was counting 12 employees at its starts, has now employed over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands its identity.
"We have followed the time spirit and its new writing need, which exists despite the uptake of the emails," said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural characteristic is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, at the film festival in Locarno, the company also placed a band of leopard patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural time spirit and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computer shells... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that brings jealousy on the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, which has been purchased today's Syntegra Capital, and thus launched a new chapter in the history of Moleskine company.
Why remains the unemployment rate of disabled workers at this high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% versus 9% of total population unemployment.
Distressing?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, who will set up the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within 15 years is considerable."
"The unemployment rate was then not double, but three times as high."
"Nottheless, there's still a huge deal to do."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed there are still numerous obstacles before they get a job.
More frequently, the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% average).
They have a low qualification level: 80% of them have no abiture and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education graduation.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in the disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to reinforce jobs and that form the "core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much to the physical brakes.
Stay the unpronounced, the spirit attitudes that, though surely but slowly develop.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS entrepreneurs for La Cité magazine stated that the managers in question have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled people", which "overrepresented" is "of persons in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual minors".
Consequently, private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have a wide way to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled workers, which was set up in a 1987 law.
These last figures, from 2008, refer to a quote of 2.6%.
"We are now at about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation responsible for entering contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "payment fees" of business places has decreased as well as the sum of amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large group of companies."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of the establishments between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees, on the other hand 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Even before they offered the "Blue Servants (20:45 o'clock) the heads, Eden Hazard and George's Leek had not hid their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far to claim that there was a secret consensus between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bands.
On the side of the audience stage of the city of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to conclude peace.
Five months after the temperate gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had not harvested anything but praise regarding his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is a Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assured the bored liller on his side.
As regards the contrast between his presentation in club and national elf"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Little I'm over the whole year what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, introduced on Friday evening against Romania as regards the match against France, to finally "glow".
However, without leaving the note of "pleasing".
The French national team has been kicking up since the age of 7 years, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This is undoubtedly contributing to strengthening the "unique" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he advocates.
"We just walked through the way."
"Let them play means great luck!"
Leek's reading with kindness "Stolz" on his side.
"The pride of carrying out a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in its property as "Nachbarn" - that France has again become a team at a very high level," and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done damn good work," he said enthusiastic.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the technician will well see the plane share with the blues (the French national elf) ... toward Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out great," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice this in the coming games." Included in the game against France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento with great optimism looks forward to replay against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the time of the Hinspiel, both crews had missed the reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy crew and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no smallest approach to doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this actually means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the adherence (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party over more than an hour clearly, but the crew was unable to press the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved any foreign business."
At home, however, in their brightly brilliant towns of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they should be in front of a public, which should be equally hot at the game, even if the party was naturally announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very narrow match, but are absolutely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance of joining the European Championship in 2012," however, the follower of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
On Friday, in Bosnia, the Portuguese forces to reach and win a gate.
Unconsistently, the Bosnians who also need a gate can already have enough.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk, since we have not achieved any foreign grand," Bento regrets.
"We will join a team that has high technical quality and has players with many individual qualitys," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already prejudiced to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the outset to give them no time to think."
A good idea, under the condition that it is being implemented this time.
