Barack Obama receives the peace nobel prize as the fourth president of the United States
U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the peace nobel prize here as the fourth president of the United States in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify the world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The Chief of the White House will arrive in the Northern Metropole with his wife Michelle tomorrow and will be busy all the time.
At first, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who chose him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The presidential couple then invested a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama accepts the prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when taking the price.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he accepts the price as a President who is currently leading war in two countries.
He has strengthened the efforts of war a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to emphasize any of his critics.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to spend for well-acting purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitative work.
The event program then provides a banket with the President and his wife, where, except the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very restrainting from the beginning to the price.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he did not deserve the price completely.
He also repeated several times that it is not only the price for him, but for all who seek the same values as he.
Immediately after the notification, he stated that this is "request for action" for him.
Natural Protectors are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the Chairman of the Civil Association "Natural Protection Community Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases, he made appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals, he called for money from investors to benefit, said Leitmeritz Police Speaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Communityist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sort basket containers in Brünn do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drink packaging, in the south-maritime villages you will find the sort-containers again in step and step.
What about Brünn?
There you need to book a few minutes to find the appropriate waste tones.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brünn would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council's masters are not adequately dealing with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because as a citizen we are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics, but especially by the waste tons for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the center to dispose of, for example, the PET bottles in a collection cart?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found until now is the marble place toward the struck gans.
Mr Underka should not be angry with his colleagues, but I feel too little of that.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not honey-slicking in other parts.
That's why all my friends don't sort the waste at all.
From fault.
It is too far from the garbage tons.
I don't wonder.
I offered some glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova Street, I have not seen any color milltons in view.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the road.
But the waste ran almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brünner socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us shame throughout the Republic instead of buying a few garbage tones more and offering the sorting of further raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after a while looking for the Internet.
According to the data of the Society EKO-COM, Brünn is really the worst in the southern marrow district.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness money
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, the budget no longer provides money for pensions, sickness funds and construction savings.
But neither for government debt interests nor for international judicial disputes.
This causes more problems that will be in the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists have continued the increase in salary for some groups, they expect that the government also pays the money for the sensitive expenditure, pensions or sickness money. "This is just a postpone of problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans pay more and more interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose where to take from, the state box is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the State holding, the tax should be increased.
For all those who the left party now gave more money: the fire force, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
To get the pensions or the sickness money from whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the State is still more guilty - in the next year it will not only be 163 billion, but much more in the state case.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will rise as faster as well as the costs and interests.
The State will need the money for compensation, and then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity money, as the government made in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the monetary decay in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing in the next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections gained in competition that can no longer be re-projected and possibly reconstituted.
Most of all, what is not free.
This means the delay or setting up of thirty large buildings, which is also threatened by the European monetary system, warns the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has suggested that it solve the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders where the State is owner of the Majority, and then the money is issued to the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividends is never safe and it is not in any way an infinite source.
In the previous year, the budget was 18 billion from CEZ.
Each year, the dividends pay environmental damage liquidations, the pension account filled up, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 percent GDP according to EU rules.
But this does not end the corneval of the transformations yet.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and crimes or for expenses for judicial disputes, even for construction.
Whether the State will manage without this money, it's not safe.
That's just gambling.
If we lose an international judicial dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The Minister will then have to save the money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the two-million project "state cash", which is intended to enable on-line monitoring for what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would be made, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing one key.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will be switching Android within a few seconds.
Exactly this option is to introduce the American company VMware, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to perform two user profiles simultaneously on the mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, declared Srinivas Krishnamurti by VMware at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM storage, on which parallelly the mentioned systems were running Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new mobile telephone technology is in full.
The company VMware is now working together with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualising and the customers are supposed to get the devices within 2012.
Schtagenang on the mountains the hotel owners are torturing
Scneeless pistes not only worry about the giant mountain inhabitants.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering the ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter holidays including Christmas and Silvester.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, find the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our views of this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on Matsch", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate to order.
Who prefers to save and where the quality of the stay is only second place, he can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmölle hotel owners now offer mainly only weekly stays for the Silvester Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they too have to give up, and enter into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter holidays always offer the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week that is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some more cheap Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel office Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Saturday in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in giant mountains.
People are waiting for snowfall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pairs were cut within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says shiefert.
Reversed and a little better than last year it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On the Saturday and Christmas we only have a few rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also be well running, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking in Janske Lazne for 80 percent for the Silvester stay.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleased to be surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now in February, but at the moment the snow comes, the interest in stays in the giant mountains will certainly increase, led by the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The giant mountains of hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow shrink.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But afterwards, a warming came back, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is Mother of Smartness
It's almost funny with what students strive to do with Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the most stumbling.
Finally, when he sweated out his long-dependent Afghanistan doctrine, it appeared that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scene three years ago.
Not only that the text itself uses the kind of speech "like in Iraq" several times, he has even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward" without cheating.
Even three years ago, he has criticized Bush ideas - fresh troop quotas in the Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "unresponsible and in its consequences karastrophical decision".
However, following months, the Bush Strategy, which was based on military recommendations, showed that the only possible and so far very successful was that the news about Iraq has no longer been spoken.
The reputation of Bush was not improved by this, because objectively he left his follower a much more grateful starting situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to increase the army quota, the military again asked him, especially the chief officer of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite subordination habits heavily criticized the adorning shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation to better.
The President hesitated three months, but no better idea, and so he deceived the general vividly about 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the promise for another 5,000, even though it initially calculated at least 10,000.
Highest problematic at the whole Obama strategy is his project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctor leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half the increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the brotherly war of the past years, the Iraq Society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by contra-indication - no one can rely on and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally properly founded, remain only shiny buildings behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistency of the conditions which further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The construction of a "actable state", which is the minimalistic objective of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizont of Obama Strategy struggled by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and now it is at the edge of the explosion.
This is the belief that the small soldiers who have broken out in the war cry about the "from home" can create a miracle here only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the troops deduction is pure liability, because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is a reluctance.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hinduchus mountain frontland.
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the reinforced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will have a very difficult question of whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period when America is going to Obama for a victory decline from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turning of the Afghan situation.
The only Trost Plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election remains, so it remains enough time to take a different strategy, it would be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in bar
The leading leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in bar this year.
This has been announced by the company who responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive stocks instead of money, but only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the case if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is thus at the top of the efforts to connect the premium bonuses of the Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the JPM organ, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he supplemented.
Goldman Sachs made herself the target of criticism, after she had left nearly $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year for premium bonuses.
The total amount of premium bonuses in the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars according to the Reuters Agency, despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political topic at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps also prepare France.
This year, women have won the nobel prices in all directions, except in physics.
Today, five recordwomen in Stockholm have taken over the nobel prizes this year in the specialized categories and for literature from the King of Sweden Carl XVI.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer was amongst them, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their landsman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone area.
The price for chemistry was given to the Israelites Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for explanation of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin confessed the Nobel Prize for Economy that Americans Elinor Ostrom and her landlord Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only specialized category in which no woman received a nobel price this year was physics.
Today, this price has been carried by scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass fibre area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD Chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prizeholders has received the diploma, the nobel medal and certification on the acquisition of the money price.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several priceholders in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversials of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the top of the country that is leading two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in keeping with his policy, he supplemented that in certain situations wars are necessary for the fighting of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the withdrawal. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, early on on Friday, who reflects on his remaining in the government because he has not agreed with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Members' Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the etat deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President's speaker, Radim Ogvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday.
According to the budget regulation,which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the proposals from the Left Party for a monetary conversion and increased the money for the public wages, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has prevented the social democracy proposals that it covers the increase of budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one side and the Government, Klaus and Legal Party, on the other hand, there was therefore a sharper internal-political dispute, which is why the question sign of the further work of the fishermen official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critists argue that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings measures that have been implemented by the fishermen government in the autumn and that, in its understanding, the government debt should be terminated.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the government budget, but does not have to, today, at the morning of discussion with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the "real problem", which represents "unholdable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only lead to a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, argued that the budget is cruel, and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer referred to similar words as "stark expressions".
The CSSD chef, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek words that the etat deficit is cruel that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and it exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unset" of the world shows a lot of the country, of whose fight and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actress.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The immature fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history of the American Oscar Shaw Player, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the 18-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I'll have to meet you.
The 70-year-old actress who had received the price for his role in the Eastwood Dreama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box area, already represented the leader of the movement of the abolition of slavery, from which to the end became a slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely one who is still alive and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the peace nobel prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "defected", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak
The film describes a true incident where Nelson Mandela assembled his powers with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree to the country. The new president Mandela knows that his people remain racial and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree with his people through sports, so he decides to join the Rugby players who are part of the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises up to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role like this to approach it as closely as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actress said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at evening and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela his hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, she's being transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actress said that he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the harsh Rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed to the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the director of Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well performed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret dissolved over Norway: The Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry only accepted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic rocket was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket called the type "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian Generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also, his repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not been started or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as a "raket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight, technical damages on the missile have occurred.
Probably the engine exploded at the third rocket level.
This time "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the shot from the U-Boot.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light that was caused by an unspecified flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not since the first moment doubted that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has rejected this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fall out and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without mistakes, the management of the Defence Ministry considers only six out of thirteen to be successful.
The nearly fifty-percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even ten hypershell atom bomb heads with a maximum weight of 1.15 tonnes.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov is presenting himself in a professional ice hockey game at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympian and Stanley Cup owner will help his team CSKA Moscow in the distress, and will probably come to Petersburg at Friday's KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at 40 years, in 1998, is at the time President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was hurt, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect a game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of these who can exalt the morals of other fellow players, co-players led up Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stormer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with one and fifty years and was able to benefit 15 meetings and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the suit of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Gold Medals, seven World Championships, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Eishockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai embraced the trade unions. All overtimes will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade unions on the removal of all overtimes.
Due to frequently appointed overtimes, the trade unions announced the strike preparedness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two labor layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work on Saturday.
The staff will also receive them in the afternoon for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtimes.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave for it on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek led up.
In addition, all the employees of the Saturday lab are paid the cash and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtimes of the most urgent and burning point were the demands and complaints of trade unions who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all overtimes for the month of December.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work practically every day after the eight hours layer.
With the signing of the agreement, strike preparedness will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the managing of the automobile factory and the trade unions are to be held on Friday afternoon.
The trade unions leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to abandon strike willingness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory was exposed to when about 400 employees struck spontaneously because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and claimed shacans.
On the other hand, the management held that the employees had to make overtimes to comply with the automobile supply requirements.
The trade unions also demanded that the employees who interrupted production on the previous Wednesday should not be sancted in their Monday-suite call.
In the area of overtime, trade unions require to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they demand to pay the fee of $5,000 this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai is now occupied with 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
Until this September, about 80 000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in HIV virus stolen
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new connections that are intended to interfere with the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact weighs against the disadvantage that the connection to usual virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicinal products.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients can, however, prolong life and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your taking is accompanied by a variety of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus proliferation has also resulted in developments such as resistance viruses that are no longer effective against medicinal products.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemic Technology University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
You have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborane affect the protein responsible for the increase of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block the virus reproduction in different ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists achieve new 'enhanced' connections that have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile cages consisting of bore, hydrocarbon and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case Kobalt.
Domestic and permanent virus
HIV proteinase is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, no mature virus particles of infection would occur.
If we disable the HIV proteinase, we also disable the multiplying of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemical and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Science Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe the whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV proteinase was tested in the reagency glass, including their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but does not lose its effect on resistance variants that are often inactive to the medicinal products used.
The unique mechanism of efficacy as well as its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarborans an interesting link for further development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for budget. ODS went to fishermen who rejected
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for the next year as "gracious" and the government of Prime Ministers of Jan Fischer should consider his further existence.
The Opinion of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "stark statements".
It is supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit or whether it is his remaining in the office with the Links of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficit is diametrally different, which Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, with links party amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Parliament has increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from covering the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has satisfied the government's wish, because also the changed budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and meaninglessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of ignorance, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government still judges the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota had seriously threatened his withdrawal for the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he considers his remaining remaining in the office.
That is why his disappointment is about the supply of the budget.
In what extent fishermen are in favour of the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominates of the social democracy (CSSD), which had implemented the budget changes, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or service laws.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not mistake
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, there are people who confesse to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit height of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in Parliament."
Then he said he could not expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about this, and if this is going to be up to date, I will deal with it, said the Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Citizen Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer fled to Brussels at the meeting of the European Council in the afternoon.
The ODS returned on the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the Members of the Citizen Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not seem to be an orphan children, we are not little children, so he then reacted to the question whether the ODS were not reversed in the political negotiation on the budget through the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
As I rejected the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be especially about the Bolschewization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new driving plan of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will be driven for approximately the same driving price.
The Czech railway ends or limits some less exhausted fast and local trains from 13 December, but other connections are strengthened.
The whole range of transport is reduced by two per cent from the date of validity of the new driving plan compared with today.
Most tariffs including base and customer drives are not changed.
For example, several connections to the capital receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway sets up trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The fast train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains will also be driven on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction in railway plans in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the environment can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week, some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis are reduced.
The largest changes include the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to climb.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko pre-course system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - main station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk/Jesenic will drive in time of two hours.
With the Pendolino the passengers have no longer been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: Growth by 200 million
The railways are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway total receives for the compensation of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion crowns,even as this year. The local trains provide the districts, they totally pay eight billion crowns for it in the next year, while the State shoots three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has re-enclosed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway commends the system, perhaps it has not taken the price increase at the large majority of tickets.
Changes are only made in case of single-day network driving licences CD Net and in favour of eLiska Internet carriers.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven pieces, until now he was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitante arrests more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary schools and their teachers.
This has been mentioned by the Agency AFP, which initially informed only over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
In the province of Agusan del Sur, it came to kidnapping.
Approximately 19 millitants claimed to use the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiating leaders are now endeavoring to issue the rest of the hostage.
According to the AFP agency, the Millitants are part of the NPA, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for violence, which demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre, where 57 people were killed, imposed on the right of stand.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which were associated with the election to the governance office, 30 journalists were.
Due to the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippinian province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
However, they restarted peace negotiations with the Phillipinese Government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes into the American cinema "Invictus: the Unset", which includes a part of the history of life of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-familiar fighter against the Apartheid has been received by Morgan Freeman, which was said to have been audienced by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
The film's film starts, too, brings critics' reactions to the public.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993, together with de Klerk the peace nobel prize.
He was elected as President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the film because it comes into the movies in a time where, on the one hand, the preparations for the world championship are culminated in South Africa, while the media at the same time shock the world publicity with fearful news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants since the black rulers.
According to the news agency AP, responses to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood Stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his own words after the new film.
This role I've been doing for many years and I've been well prepared for it.
Many times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could receive his energy, as you say, he was in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this movie.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every man, he supplemented.
In the Wi-Fi of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book leaflet of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united portrays the South African defendant of human rights during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two race-and-racial groups each other and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, in his role in the South African National Rugby address, which then won South Africa.
For the entry of the breed in the dress, almost as a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested fourteen years ago large ovations, mainly from the white audience, and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may perform the assembly of the people to a single people again, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "Black" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa is improved, that will only appear.
But the White South Africans are skeptical, such as in a recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Great Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out at the transformer of the Ceps company in the circuit system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area in the morning.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the district fire force Usti nad Labem, Luke Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn the transformers out, but later it changed its view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special waste materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer corridor.
No one was injured, the Havarie did not jeopardise the safety operation of the management system according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at a number of 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will not be counted until after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new, according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, there has not been anything similar to the Ceps company, errors of this kind are rare, supplemented it.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the Speaker of the Society of CEZ for North Böhmen, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the trafostation did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It entertains, renovates and develops 39 switch systems with 67 transformers, transferring the electrical energy into distribution system and control line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura raises announcement for blasphemy against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancurua, today raises punishment for blasphemy against three socially democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Mower, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute non-view in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term agreements with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take the rosines out, while we have presented the offer only about the extent that it was voted with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So nothing remains for us but to defend us.
Due to this blasphemy of the Society Student Agency, Jancura said to the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek believes that the collection of the criminal advertising is the further continuation of the medial show by Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am prepared to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also urge further leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura that manipulates the public and uses false and false arguments in the matter of regional railway transport, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He said to the radio record that he interrupts the campaign after Christmas, and he wants to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura, after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech railway and no tendering for the order at a height of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behavior is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura said, he was already threatened by a member of the CSD.
The only threat was if we do not fail to lose the bus licenses as well.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radio journal today.
vaccination against pneumocococks free and voluntary
Infection against pneumocococks changes the usual from January.
It is supposed to be the first for the families free and voluntary.
But votes now report that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumocococks culminate.
The Medicines Institute already determines the maximum prices of the vaccines to pay health insurance.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
vaccination free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumocococks that were born on August 2, last year and later.
The condition that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Those who have started vaccination last year or earlier also have to pay further repeat vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child’s life.
Previous year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcots.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses is spending 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the State has spent about 500,000 per year for all the area vaccinations of children.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause median ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcinfections die in us after study in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumocococks has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
From January, this is to be paid by insurance and voluntarily.
For example, that the compulsory vaccination would be better mentioned by the Head of the Nahlas Civil Association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has already been working for the Pneumocococc vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have managed to implement that at least.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococks.
At this moment we do not consider that at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical child doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, you might think about the reduction in the number of vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary,” says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to let their infants vaccinate pneumococcs from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcans is also causing it to be paid as the first area vaccination by the health insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should spend the money for prevention in order to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova approves.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves anxiety of practical child doctors relating to the purchasing of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and then the doctors should receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance could "due the money out of health insurance".
Therefore the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance pays them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is an important sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist son participated in "museum diet"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was invited 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It says that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used a bagger to invade the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of designs like Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the news agency Associated Press, the artist held up at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feast.
The Agency reported, according to a police lawyer statement, Frazetta Junior, he was ordered by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all the means to bring all paintings into a camp."
The Agency informed that Frank Frazetta Senior contested to have granted any permission.
Labour defends etat and tax increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops that have been announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had given an opportunity to "sustain" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The tax Chancellor was also eligible for the purpose of targeting workers with low and medium income.
The main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% cup limit of public salary accounts for 2011.
Social insurance disorders
On the other hand, the trade unions protested that low wage recipients were punished for a recession which they did not cause and warned against the coming "problems".
The increase in social insurance - to approximately 3 billion British pounds per year - has irritated the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase limited to those who earn more than 20,000 £ per year will affect approximately 10 million workers.
SWORPUNCTS OF THE PROCEDURE REPORT
Increase in social insurance by more than 0.5 % from April 2011
This year's economic shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on banking bonuses
Rejected 1 percentage increase in body tax for small enterprises
Releases for electrical vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the tax office, someone with an annual income of 30,000 £ by 90 £ per year will be poorer and someone with 40,000 £40,000 a year will be 190 £ poorer, while a person with 10,000 £10,000 annual income will be richer by 110 £.
The Ministers said that their goal of deficit halving by 2013 meant "threat decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burdens of additional taxes would fall off to the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms argues that the rated tax increases and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit halvation and this is also essential over the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions on future economic growth – which affects the extent of the redebt and the speed of the deficit transfer – were questioned after the tax Chancellor was forced to review previous figures.
In his opinion, he said that the economy is likely to decrease by 4.75% this year - far more than the decline that was predicted in April - while the debt would be more than 3 billion £ than it was estimated before.
"The Missed Occasion"
The conservatives who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday in order to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is inconsistent.
They added that the Ministers have failed to present a credible plan to refund this and to press cyanically before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You said nothing of importance about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The significant announcements are only made after the choice, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour maintains that schools, hospitals and police are preserved from future shortages, in contrast to the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit capture coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argues that the plans are "builded on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the notifications, such as the above inflation adjustment in some invalid pensions in the next April, the tax Chancellor would suspend the claim of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide additional assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Heel Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any etat details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public expenditure will only be on the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Examination said that the numbers of the tax Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the fields of transport, university, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are only made after the choice, whoever wins it," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to the economic audit company Deloitte.
"This was only the hole pre-etat report. The markets recognize that."
FBI examines "Agencies of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported US citizens due to the suspicion of extremeist relations in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an assault to a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panda Province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigated whether these are the same men that were reported missing in Virginia the last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistani descendants, one is Egyptian origin and the other has an Yemenic background.
"If they are American citizens, of course we are very interested in the accusations they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was connected with the families of missing students.
"We work together with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay there if it are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no accusation against the arrested men has yet been made.
The Reuters news agency reported that it refused foreign minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States must "more cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan in destroying the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "Miss practices" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organisation Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed, leading to the largest road protests since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Thousands of people were sentenced to prisons and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closing of the Kahrizak Trafanstalt.
But since then there has been no more tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against election results.
"They struck me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and became, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, informed Amnesty.
The struck presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election were tortured in the prison in August and raped others.
The Iranian authorities denied the prosecutions of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner, who said that he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others over eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had founded a committee to examine the disturbances after the election and reaction of the government, but Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these institutions and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to convert a sign into a race piste in Bristol.
The ships of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the hang in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jumping chunk at the beginning of a 100 meters long hanging.
The student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the hang, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some right talents."
Prices were granted for the best pieces of art exported on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and we
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted for a minarette construction ban and the concerns about the supposed isolation of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularized societies of Europe.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love headcooks" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and tight-reasoning study of a question that the country shared and occupied over a half decades and whose effects are still being observed today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and more cozy spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in this area.
He has spent months in Mosheen, schools and institutes, now offering the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamic Freespaces".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students on the questions they most worry about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a council house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a zin-oriented banking system to get a hypothesis?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims that the daily life constitutes, in contrast to the political dramas that the media are dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Arab Muslim and academic scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be, on the one hand, a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good national in a modern secular society.
You don't have all arguments on their side.
Conservatives are distrusted with the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who asked Bowen are mostly unanimous with their salafi matches – the puristic Sunitian Islam that is connected with Saudi Arabia – which today shows a small but influential presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be consistent.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions how much French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elites, who so passionately guarded the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a more raw treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to compromise their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "sharpness of values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Trustlessest View of the World
The Arctic changes faster and dramaticer than any other environment region on earth.
The ice that they mark smelts with an alarming speed and takes life with itself that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fisheries interests have entered open water, with diplomates, lawyers and now authors in their cable water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icons of the north, the ice bear.
In the complex history and policy of the whale, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old coat to the lake, who struggled only with the rifle of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears, captured when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were brought to Zoos and Circuss.
A circus performance early the 20th century showed 75 ice bears at an idea.
Even today, zocal systems are typically still possessing a million set of the life of a wild-living old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore became very green by the algae that grows in the hollow hair of his peal.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often turns back to the threat of hunters for survival of the species.
Although Norway, America and Russia are prohibited, the construction of Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding inuits use powerful storm guns to bring their prey to the route.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packing insight of how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of changes adequately.
But that is not a lack of explanations.
The pioneer trips of Fredtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century were the first time to take the confusion of the packaging.
Undersea boats considerably in the Cold War the moving grass during the subway.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the wide-range distribution of measuring suns to icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson looks into the strange, small world of the influencing system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by salt water rinse, which is collated in the freezing process.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopyly small miracles in the ice, everyone is threatened of it when once the ice is gone, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... that could be We"
Marine infantists were among the 6,000 who lay down in Arlington cranes
The top-free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single crance on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other maritime infants who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribulation to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
In a few months, wherever we get back from, we could be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put crowns on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the grief cancer manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who are doing this trip each year, to stop in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a commonly useful organization, Wreaths Across America (Crowns across America), which also expanded the event to other countries.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at Pentagon, on graves of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 for the second time for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she had taken the trip to Arlington in her memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something to the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the expanded grass surfaces and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organisers say.
The mood was joyful, children played, and couples kept on their hand while wearing the fresh jaws to the grey tombstones.
Each round crance was dark green with a small red sleeve attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mainly veterans of wars were buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained nearly calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the darkness of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individual crying openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the iron air.
Some read the names made in stone, while others bow down to small black-white spot cards that had been placed in the wet mud whose grave stones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before her son's grave.
She is 8 hours away from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of marine infrastructure sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government arrested a contractor of the US Government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor who has not yet been identified works for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The Society is working on projects for customers, such as USID, the U.S. Audience for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. Interest Representation in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not yet been published, although a Cuban national or a foreign visitor can be arrested under Cuban law for almost everything under the accusation of "hazard".
All so-called Conterrevolutionary Activities, including mild protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy grave fiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community that is addressed by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested a permit to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase the tension between the Communist Government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama Government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday.
The new US policy stresses the fact that the United States will provide a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used today for sending text messages as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a day pay.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites, access is restricted.
On Cuba the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting for crimes such as drugs smuggling behind grids, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US Interest Representation in Havanna.
Berbena said she could not give any further information about arrest.
The arrest and arrest are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issue of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", a record of Raul Castro as the leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover the plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aiming to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US Soldaten, and said that they hope that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist candidates searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they had searched for an opposing, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had submitted comments on terrorist attacks that were agreed on the Internet video page YouTube.
After arriving in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan’s family belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saivolleh could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the impopular mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refugee place.
They were regarded as part of a covered operation.
Therefore they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged at all and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani penalty authorities.
The case of five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being consulted by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in the decision who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of most urgent urgency to accommodate human asset posts within Al Kaida.
The attendants of the organization act as practicers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American Mighty Recruits are subjected to a special test by A Kaida, said analytics.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda values, they are also considered to be extremely attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, rank highest analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they have allowed access, because the US secret services have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrations demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded from the retailers at the Bella Congress Centre of the city more cozy action in climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, but the police estimates were rather out of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small bombs near some government buildings in the city centre.
On one day when the climate negotiations supported by the UN little took place, thousands of activists wandered through the city on which in English "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travels to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of the heart-taking problems that the country has to face because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to forward the word and appeal to the world leaders to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not a easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no longer a way to go around it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought pocket knives.
According to the Danish Law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrations in black clothing burned several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, in the vicinity of several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered from TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems not to have reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international thoughts, he answered in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the place of events is great, I can't hear what happens out there."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the focus of the broad public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show hard-new racial air
The evidence of mathematics performance was welcome for the public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, the highest performance results, the evidence shows that the four- and eight-classes have made more rapid progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest numbers of the national evaluation of educational progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hard-needing performance gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of white four-class clothes from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), which increased only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African eight clothes remained basically the same, he fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample volume was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth clothes in 2003 when the first NAEP was covered in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score of the children of both groups has grown in this period, the difference with now has little decreased by 58 points.
Some of the district's educational advocates expressed their concern last week about the fact that the results of school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, most of white students who are already powerful children, have been promoted.
This indicates that we have raised the overall value by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult,” said Jeff Smith, member of the Board of Directors of D.C. Voice, a common-benefit group who enters for educational equality in Washington D. C..
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Basic School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of test points is that the middle schools of the city need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect them.
But what fears me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy that we have to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new lecture plan, the Wilson-Lese system, aimed at students in the upper secondary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not been mixed at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their classmates.
All-day mathematics, a educational plan that brings out from the children's garden to the sixth class of games and life-sensitive experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey, and this teaching plan is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I mean, we must continue to work to benefit the best measures to the students below the nominal level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the system's overall performance and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the weak schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examined urban test results.
The conventional cure consists in addressing its resources and management reforms to schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political consequences that work against this important item of agenda.
The weakness is of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance air is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the Charter Schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' trade unions last year over 185 days a year, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
High education for more people than the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg colleague with a loud pepper.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and flashes a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the tile stone folds and the smaragd green grass.
Graciela's parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was held in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eight-classmen of the group, who explore Gettysburg, where the school costs 38.690 dollars per year, were more the ones of a disgraceful visitor than the ones of a enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! Here I'll be soon!" Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was reported the low professor-to-study relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children have visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants, who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive college training, which are necessary to get into the middle layer.
In fact, one out of five of these "second generation" of Hispano Americans ends the college – which is a remarkable performance, since many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, says researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the workforces of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and a inherent motivation for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of knowledge with American schools.
But advisory programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially when these efforts continue for a long time.
If one looks at income weak children whose parents do not have experience and skills to help them search through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas' college tour was financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turn up a walk - and provides over 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income poor students are in the middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Education Department, the programme has helped more than 10 million students from which more than 60% have gone to college since 1999.
Iraqi oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oils point out that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares of two of the 10 hidden fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company that has issued a commandment has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields covered in June.
The thin seeded representatives of American oil multiply at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry were surprised by the analysts.
After six years of war, Iraq finally opened its gates and introduced Asian and European companies instead of U.S. companies, said Ruba Husari, publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, a online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still underlined by massive co-ordinated bombs on Tuesday and political instability through the decline of the US military probably have prevented American oil companies from, said analytists to engage more in Iraq, which has the third largest evidenced raw oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more risky because they do not have to discharge shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been sided with technical advice in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the Speaker of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to meet its companions and fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
Compared to the fee per ceiling oil which the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emission of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida evidently killed in Pakistan
In the case of an obvious US rocket attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, this week a top action planer of Al Kaida is supposed to have been killed, reports representatives of the US terrorist fighting on Friday.
This would, if it would be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles that met their vehicle near Miran Shah in the province of North Walesistan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistan civil secret service from Miran Shah on the phone.
Local residents who suspected to be part of the military ran to the place and quickly took all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorism combating showed uncertain evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planer of Al Kaida, who led the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan Pacistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy throughout the world, noted a leader who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the warm nature of US air attacks on Pakistani ground.
It also includes the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and transformed them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali had quickly risen in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be familiar with some Americans, said the second government representative, but this does not at all reduce the danger that he represented for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader, who has been killed since September, than in a similar attack on Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA has declined from a average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website that has been conducted by a publicly useful organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of the terror groups who have taken steps to reduce their attackability and at the same time kill brutally in suspected informants, the page reported.
Leading UN messenger in Kabul will resign
On Friday, the leading United Nations Messenger in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would resign from his office in March, resulting in the end of a stormy time of office that was suffered by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
The Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US solar data to Afghanistan.
The UN Messenger said that he supports the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghanes that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian assistants to help in the political change of Afghanistan.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not settle his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made toward his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the UN notification.
Forward Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a follower, said the oath.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-Staffan di Mistura, who has recently led the UN mission in Bagdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously led UN peace operations.
Eiders' position in Afghanistan was put on the test after his former alternate, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to hide evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "had undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a large degree of skepticism regarding international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative in order to coordinate the aid measures of American armies in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his follower to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries that donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his powers in Afghanistan and said that the absurd UN setup systems have undermined its possibilities to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that I have been able to set only one person since May, he said.
This is disastrous and must not go on that way.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon "relevant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions about his nuclear plans.
During a seven-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US soldiers in Northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he answered the question of a soldier about the probability of such development.
"One of the things that are on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, that is the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama Government considers a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's military and political elites, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Irish authorities.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons", because "your people will suffer more unheartedly" under sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion of the White House speaker, Robert Gibbs, the U.S. Government joined the European top politicians in the warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if it does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology is to be acquired for peaceful purposes only.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the discussions to restrict his nuclear program and would abstain from a major part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US Government has forced this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to win time for negotiations.
But since that time Iran seems to have abandoned negotiations on the provisional agreements - partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees whether they should engage in relation to the United States.
The fact that Iran left the international community in terms of some proposals which they had already agreed on at the beginning of October has, openly said, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chineses, together in a way that they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set the 31rd dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he continues to pursue other options, including those which the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressive sanctions".
In a opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation of the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "on groundless and unfounded claims" of some Security Council members concerning Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue conversations with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially with regard to borders, property rights and the breakdown of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the American troop force from 115 000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse the Kurdish concerns about the coming troop withdrawal. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, President of the Kurdish Regional Government of Masud Barzani, said: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A course change in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up around propaganda plakats that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer by the low birth rate and the older population, and encouraged young couples to have more than a child, their answer was immediately and final: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a personnel manager with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-infant policy in China, the two generations of notorically thick, obsolete single children, which are lovingly called "small emperor", raises a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time that this policy entered into force, the United Nations
Department for population issues firmly, while the number of populations aged 60 and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosively by 2050. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 years of age and older were almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghai, while the birth rate was below a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghaier City Population and Family Planning Comission, said that pairs in a growing age need to get babies in order to "help to reduce the ratio of older population shares and to reduce the lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "so old -- but not as rich as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's single-child policy is likely to be the controversy that has been introduced by the dominant Communist Party until today.
couples who violate this policy must expect enormous penalties - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed this policy to preventing the critical use of natural national resources, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policy.
In rural regions, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sexually selective abortions, resulting in an unusually high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives of the population have gradually weakened their attitude toward single-child politics.
In 2004 they approved more exceptions to the rule -- including urban inhabitants, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh strokes was reduced.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to allow two children whose partner is a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which started an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Plakats that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by directives that detailedly describe who is in question for a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city administration has sent out urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing Reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the external areas of Shanghai said that a rise in the requests for pairs that wish to have a second child after the campaign was launched, the urban districts did not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with an inhabitant of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still submitted per month.
Disappointed Shanghaier officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city, despite the campaign, will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghaier municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want children.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also legally allowed.
But they possess, as many Chinese, only a little sickness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the western world count the one-child policy falsely as a human rights question, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yeah, you're robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the personnel manager, said she wanted only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to see everyone cared for us.
We are not used to care for others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Sieian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblemished.
For parents from the medieval with double career, through which the birth rate declines, he said, it turns to be successful and you must be selfish.
The age group of 20-39-year-olds today grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment, and they do not want a life for themselves, he said.
Also a single child, he said, presents huge requirements to the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one who has achieved a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group designs a plan for emission reduction
The Climate Conference, supported by the UN - which has been awarded by wild poses and mutual accusations so far - has set a new focus on the publication of a document on Friday, which will be a ambiguous reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, and the industrial nations will have to train the largest burdens in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered to be an important progress in a negotiation that takes time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, which was formulated by a UN Working Group specifically designed for this purpose, is silent over the amount of money that wealthy countries should give to the poor countries so that they can overcome global heating in short and long term.
It also offers a set of options for key issues, including how industrial and large threshold countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit should be of the global temperature increase that political decision-makers would contribute.
The process will be given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, director of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to put the focus on what the leading UN Climate Representative, Yvo de Boer, described as "the great whole".
It shows the basic rise of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared with the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the discussions on Friday an incentive by its assurance to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to the prevention of deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal fireworks were brought, which had been determined by the discussions last week.
The U.S. Climate Special Agent Todd Stern has rejected the binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger threshold countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama Government is driving a harder line with China as representative of the Bush Government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreement without taking up larger threshold countries and measures, so star who also complained that the text would not go far enough, ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star delivered his opinion an hour after the Chinese Vice-Organist He Yafei declared that the leading American climate dealer lacked either of "the reason" or it was "most irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help China to master global heating.
The future economic direction of the great world powers in danger has opened breaklines both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the threshold countries.
The current struggle is likewise related to the rescue of individual economics and to the salvation of the planet, where China and the United States faced their corresponding obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have gone over to take more aggressive action to account the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic predominance, so Ulate, also acting as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to the impact of climate change stated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of the small islands with 43 members presented a 24-page contract draft on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the openness of the small island states "exerts political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now united and demand measures from the threshold countries, such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgentness when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the government leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, departed from their planes and rushed through the loops of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to terminate claims that are negotiated during the next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13.000 people enter and launch every day in the Congress Centre, guitar-playing activists organise night-to-day shows where they are funny about the countries that they think they betray and sell, and contract drafts are hand-by-handed instead of being forwarded by email -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just based on: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
United Kingdom first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pepper will penetrate the darkness to announce an award tour that represents a revolution in traffic in UK.
The first high-speed donor train in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras on his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, and place 93 km back in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then join Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin Pendel Service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will finally connect faster, reliable trains to an international rail network and will connect the large balling areas of the Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendant cities, working hours would be drasticly reduced and the switch of aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and gases on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
However, the many billions of British pounds, which are needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning struggles and fears of environmental damage could still slow the brakes in the British high-speed glues.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis, according to the Times, will submit the report on 30 December.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed grid.
The new railway line that London is intended to connect to the West Midlands will pass by a five-metre play area to urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed grid network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped line, where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split into or near Birmingham and a departure would lead west of Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another toward the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After finishing, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part line, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with something over an hour today.
The drafts offer the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest of Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters of long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would in turn mean that a final station in London would be needed to complete 20,000 travellers per hour.
In view of the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks this plan should be continued, but the long-term public advice and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
First, the trains had to switch from high-speed routes to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, so the travel period between London and Scotland would continue to be over three hours.
This is considered a crucial point to ensure a switch from a plane to a railway, a direction for rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the conservatives, has taken account of the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange, which he is building in his home in his electoral circle.
The prison speaker of the party, which was degraded by David Cameron because he complained about the need for underhouse members to live "of mager rations", has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to have an oak wood craft cultivation on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to take account of the additional interest income to the taxpayer, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The supervisors of the underhouse approved the applications at the time and they were not also questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night, Duncan said that the requests could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-store house in a village in his electoral area Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a expenditure control point of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan has also not been invited to take a view to increasing money collection during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee released it last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of more than 271,406 pounds (EUR 300,000) from his London House to his electoral circuit house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as a parliamentary member.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received some 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage rate by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, which shows that the total increase was used to finance the funding of 75,000 pounds (8,000 euros).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate decreased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The most recent documents published by the underhouse show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his position as the opposition leader of the underhouse in September, after a subcover reporter filmed him when he said after the expenditure scandal that Members of Parliament would live "of thiner rations".
"In essence, if you work for the state, it means that you have to live by magnifying rations and how S*****e is treated."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden, and I have made the right to a disappearing small part, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil-gross dealer, was first attacked in May because of his expenditure, as it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fees Office that this could be considered as an excessive demand.
As a protest in Duncan's grass, an activist has buried a hole in the form of a pounds sign after it has become known that he had requested 4,000 pounds over three years (4,500 euros).
When he was asked yesterday night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved both by the Fees Office and subsequently by Add to the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about excavation and slopes or a disregard of rules or similarities.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all of your believers to admire Brighton's beach huts Advents calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new content of life for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as topic.
The event started on December 1, and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 p.m. with free glue wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The currently selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where here the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and celebrate enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach cabin advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against climate heating, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least 30 thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to organisers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion that could enter into force from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to illustrating that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train had passed, as a group of 300 demonstrations, all dressed in black, shouted windows with patches and hammers, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-World Polices have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimate, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, have been arrested in the east of France in April, this extremely violent divisions that have already been celebrated at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstrators, has criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant attendants have been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about hundreds of you have been held in the streets on Saturday evening, despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seat position.
The more peaceful train has been taken from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers for one evening with candle light, taking part of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrators are bushs and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, and some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue rainbows, have made a first rise in the morning in Copenhagen, since you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue times" for the "climbing justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a recovery of the ecological debt for the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Phillipian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue this way and tell ourselves that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, water runs where you can walk, as never was the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
The European agency José Bové, the design of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climage Rights and Social Rights": "Now there are no differences between the fight against climate heating and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific Area, where many islands are located which are particularly dangerful as a result of heating, has given the start shot for demonstrations.
According to Australian organisers, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, mostly students who have marched in red and have eaten bandanas in which you have celebrated the sun energy.
In Hong-Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrations took place in order to demand an energetic approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abchazia chose its president, Georgia denounces that it is a "strick".
Abchazia chose its President on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as its own, Tbilissi denuncated the "strook".
Some 131.000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control over the south-Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area that Russia recognized.
The election rooms closed at 17 a.m. GMT.
The election involvement was approximately 58% a few hours before the closure of the elections, according to the Abchasian Electoral Commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President, Serguei Bagapch, are categorically rejecting the idea of reunification with Georgia which condemns the election.
These choices are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saachvili, regrets the fact that Abchazia is now under susceptible total occupation, his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze, has explained.
Besides Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the self-employment of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world sees it as part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, thousands of people died, Abchazia wants to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Quartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the choosers who went to choose in an electoral room in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch is seen on the side of the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are all in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, that is in the eastern part of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the execution of elections.
We, the Abchassian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abchazia's self-dependency.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament and has raised a glass of wodka.
The opposition on their part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian business men, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow in the previous year, as those in Abchazia leave Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims neither to support the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50 % plus one vote is necessary to win the choice.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second election round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Copenhagen incidents
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to take action, have arrested some 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand, according to the organisers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrations stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to intervene.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for one evening with candle light, taking part of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were all dressed in black and armed with back stones and inhibitors began to lay in discs, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-World Polices have immediately circumcised you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and made clear that it is mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent divisions that have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury by a patrol stone during the incidents, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," explained the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of order forces crawled in the air.
Most demonstrators traveling by rail or by their own vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue rain coat, formed themselves in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "Blue Seas" for "Climage Rightness".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the south," explained the activist Lidy Nacpil of the South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves anymore, we have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that seal, there are water runs that you can run through, which was never before the case."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opposers has approached environmental protection organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové explained to AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against heating and the fight for another world today."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish Model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific Area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to the heating of the earth, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of organisers, about 50,000 people have gone on the road.
In Manila, some hundreds of students, dressed with bandanas, have made advertising before the city management of the philippinian capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350" several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered together in Geneva.
The facts of geography and history, according to chatel, are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées.
In an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the national Minister for Education, Luc Chatel, explained that the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not required to be taught in the terminal (12 school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four week hours and the same program," confirmed Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "this shiny holiness must be overcome," because he says "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, in general, a concentration "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued, underlined: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who had been concerned about the lack of historical geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticize the state project to terminate obligatory education in history and geography in the terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
On the other hand, the Minister answered that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the Terminals S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (studerers and trade unions) had called to protest on the project for Tuesday, which they believe are victims of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister argued that it was conducted in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of a professional qualification test and at the end of the year of an approval audit, which examines their qualifications.
They also conduct practitioners during the year in M2 and then instruct the students as a teacher in the practitionership.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "sache that does not exist in the formation of people."
He once again confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Suprerieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit : this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to tackle on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Suprerieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP found, the peace nobel prizemaker Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences at which experts each turn 15 minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
You want to do something to reach the people and give them a feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, and one of the organisers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students have given to the fish at the pool of school.
"According to the experts, the twenty discussion participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explained.
"Climate heating can be spoken for hours, but the core goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, which only spoke freely with the use of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined in the hope that the listeners may find that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos turned by these conferences will be found online from 15 December on the page of the school.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will then take place every two months.
Payment delay : wrathful prisoner, actions planned
On Friday, the trade unions called on a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was suspended for budgetary reasons were transferred before January.
The second collaboration of penalty officers ("FO-Pénittiaire") called on the employees who do not have a service to demonstrate on Tuesday morning before the penal tribunal and to block them in order to pay attention to the "steal of what is present to them".
The 3rd trade unions of penalty officials ("CGT Penitentiaire") called on to "combine to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surpluses, and the Sunday and holiday surpluses in December are burned as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first trade unions of criminal officials, the Autonome Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilisation...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Criminal Office and the Ministry of Justice declared that the overtimes have increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining demands will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of criminal officials, guaranteed that payment will be made in the next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep and modernise our punishment system," the Minister of Justice informs us in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the penalty enforcement agency to take immediate measures so that such a situation, which has arisen by the lack of assessment of the overtimes that are coming, will not be repeated in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is thirsty, except for the headquarters who are enjoying high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "haushaltstranges" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade unions FO in Marseille argues and announces "all congregations and calls" to boycott to new instructions.
"The staff won't go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtimes," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more responsibilities are being put on us without more staff, the attempt to enrich the resources of the staff is more than unpleasant," says the CGT Association of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong to find the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama is the view that he distributes Christmas increasingly better gifts than he gets himself.
The U.S. president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, explained to Oprah Winfrey, the TV Talkmaster, that he will distribute better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special broadcast that was emitted on Sunday evening through the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave insight on how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the little four-bone accompanyer of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," Michelle Obama confirms and adds that the dog is given a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims on the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nailed the President.
"So please," he sweared to her and pointed out to the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV modernist who had supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle of ten walks and also a basketball that his father, which he rarely saw, had brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Only much later in my life, I realized that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her puppy house.
"I didn't even know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was moved into a artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles for significant "shames" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated in Los Angeles from Wednesday to Thursday in the Cedars Sinaï Hospital, after the American doctors had discovered "injury caused by the operation of a band disc incident", which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries would have required a new operation.
However, the producer company of the singer wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and notified that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "poor and complications".
However, only after 48 hours, a little more certain about the patient’s condition was added when he opened his eyes.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "out of certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris was "nonly dronage".
The rocker had been operated in the international Clinic of Parc Monceau for a band disc incident.
The action planned for several days was conducted by neuro surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday for comments on RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered on Monday at the Cedars Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that you need "no concern" to make the rock musician, since this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was nasty to get into a plane for twelve hours after such surgery," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday “reacts well to the antibiotics” and that“the infection was inhibited”.
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the woman of the singer, and he did not feel any particular anxiety.
Yet, the concern for the singer’s health has grown since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP" that led to a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a good-bye tour.
However, since then every health problem has been fully commented. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer had efforts to move at the stage.
First in mid-November, the surrounded persons had to demente a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Cursus: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-fold medal winner at the 2009 swimming world championships, took an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the shortway in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn surprised over 4 x 200 m lies and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m lags of the men.
Shade for Bousquet, who wanted to take the world record at 50m free style, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two kingly distances in swimming, 50m free style, the 28-year-old French claimed in 20,53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it is eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in increasingly larger and in this case I have said that if the world record is in my scope, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethan suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not been paid for the German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and the world record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m free style (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," explained Biedermann.
USA : Graph plate at Zola estimated to 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which appeared at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been rated with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "five scenes of Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the extension of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday compared to AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is surely what the buyers have offered most for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, then she ducked piece for piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel for this purpose and found Paul Reynaud, Minister in the IIIrd French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
In search of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "inheritance of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's Trip from Honduras towards Mexico has been defeated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the disrupted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to home ground as no longer agreed, after rejecting this conduct by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place in the night, everything seems to suggest that there is a disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the plane issued by the Mexican Government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its origin.
The Putsch government wanted to need M. Zelaya to "continue" and to ask for political asylum in abroad.
However, the disrupted President rejected this, as he wanted to return to Mexico as the well-established, official Head of State.
The Putsch regime "had suffered a new failure by trying to move me to give up on my expenses (...), they wanted me to quit," said M. Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, in which he has reported frequently since the beginning of the political crisis that has been held in the Middle American country for five months.
I can stay here well and pleased ten years, here I have my guitar, added the disrupted President, who had fled into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some accordes.
The Mexican message has presented a request to us for guidance, but unfortunately, as it did not contain asylum request, on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, the Inner Minister of Putsch Government, had explained to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I don't seek asylum in any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible journey from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only do as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of M. Zelayas had mobilized the adherents of the broken president who had opened up to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, and the military there had strengthened his efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch Government.
This, according to its assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist venezuelanian President Hugo Chavez, was crashed on June 28, on the day of the referendum organized by him to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on September 21 and had fled into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he is imprisoned for traitors whose charges he is charged with by justice, says the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to resolve M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial elections, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the cogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to the office until the end of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in rising, the US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange completed on Thursday with a high number of American trade balances showing a course recovery of the US shares and their partners: Dow Jones has added 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
Due to the numbers at stock conclusion, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 was recorded with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from various industries, sentenced Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotic under the presumption that the market focuses only on "half-full glasses", so it was appropriate.
Measuring Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the American trade balance, "which show an improvement in the activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States’ trade deficit decreased by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion in relation to September.
On the other hand, analytists had expected a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the goods export, which reflects the economic growth of the main trade partners in the United States, said Christopher Cornell of business research Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the state of 474 000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers during the last four weeks was "fall to the depth of the year", said Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of state bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared with 3.432% from the date of service, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% from the morning.
Cuba: Hundreds of power-standing partizanes pee "Damen in Weiss" out
Some hundreds, on the Thursday of Cuban power, have poured out the wives gathered in Havanna for the purpose of the world's day of human rights by political prisoners and also forfeited another advertising, due to the temporary arrest of a good dozen dissident.
In order to take the forty "Damen in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, on the open street of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the footmarch in the center of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Soldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Es lives Fidel and Raul!" the authorized parties scanned the dissidents with a lifted fist.
The latter were escorted by civil agents that appeared to "sail their protection".
Similar demonstrations against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana, where there was no injured or arrested.
On the other hand, in the area of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who also took place on Thursday's demonstration in view of the International Day of Human Rights were temporarily arrested by civil police, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents of the government, which were embossed by the parties of the government, under violence, to join civil vehicles.
The temporary arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As advocates of the Sakharov Prize issued by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "Bitte for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to dissident lists, has some 200 people, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda is a member of the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, from which 53 are sitting behind grids to date.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "soldner" or "agents" in the service of the declared erectile enemy, the United States.
A strangeness in itself is that the Cuban television presented a report on the demonstration events held on Thursday between military pro-governmental combaters and "contra-revolutionary".
The Cuba, led by a Unit, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of the impression of rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of opinion.
Crazy kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday afternoon, one with two knife armed madman killed an eight-year-old man on the main business time in Clichy-la-Garenne city centre (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
With the first details of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old in or before a pharmaceutical on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knifes and, according to this, police statements, in the presence of Witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to be the consequences of his injuries, according to an officer of the police syndrome Alliance in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmaceutical, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, approximately in the thirty-six, has intervened and has been injured.
The first two victims were severely injured to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, seems to have been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become bad as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in the "socket state" of a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcoholic or drug influence, should immediately be removed from the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passengers, apparently randomly: a thirty-fourty-year-old, with the last of both difficult.
The scene remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat meat meat measuring, which he had crossed behind his back, declared on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible of the Syndicate Alliance of the Haut-de-Seine area.
Several passengers, including youths, are supposed to have tried to bind the crazy ones, according to the witness reports established by the AFP.
I've seen a guy in the thirty-six with a green west.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They did not succeed because the guy was well built, Alberto, a servant of a nearby bar.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city police officers, including their managers, have tried to arrest the armed man and have been injured with knifes, so police information.
The event has been played in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main hits, where there are a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is a injured person out there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them in first-help position and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty years old person came injured by cuts.
Employees of the State Police have finally arrested the man who had no identification documents.
Nanterre's prosecution has instructed the district reference to the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case.
The crazy one was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, it has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude that he is delivered to a nervous hospital.
With another police source, six policemen invited him to bond him at the police commissioner in Clichy, where he was taken away.
He was "in a state of overrest" like "all the spiritually confused of this kind, where the forces are released during the tatherpass".
U.S.A.: Polanskis lawyer calls for a re-repealance of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski asked for the repeated trial on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, western United States, to drop the penalties against his clients, who are currently at his residence in Switzerland due to a secrecy of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", spoke to three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California in 1977 of the negotiation.
I insisted on a criminal decision, M. Hummel explained before he added that the behavior of Judge Laurence Rittenband, which was appointed at the time of the hearing, "it was a cold one's back down".
In fact, before he fell his judge's speech, the judge - now dead - had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represents a grave error of proceedings.
This discussion was rejected in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared the authors of the documentary film "logogen" at the end of September.
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requires the leadership of a process which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentation.
On the other hand, the accusation repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the action stocks charged to the accused person cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had escaped from the United States in 1978, even before the proclamation of punishment for "Illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has no longer traveled to the United States.
The Vice-President of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the negotiation".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to others accused that escape is a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
They believe that "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to announce their decision – even stressed that there were other alternatives to escape.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the attitude of criminal prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Also, the lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, demanded that the criminal procedure be repealed.
She reminded her client that it would no longer be tolerated to be disturbed by any resurrection of Affaire Polanski, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the occasion of an American arrest order.
After spending two months behind grids, he was then sentenced in expectation of any delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is broken by the increase of the dollar and ends without course.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without course in a market, which was between better indicators than planned in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available at closing, Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Finally, the market is quite quiet," Mace discovered a glimpse silver by Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that it will remain like this until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned to "helpe to improve the market view on the solidarity of the economic recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the United States, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months afterwards and far more than intended.
In addition, American consumers’ confidence has improved significantly in December, with 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been broken by a new increase in the dollar course, which has been at the highest level for two months compared to the euro, which means that ''the sectors of the economic situation are pushed down," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The liability market has declined.
The yield of tax bond over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the bond over 30 years to 4.497% versus 4.492% of the previous day.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of rounding through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the last barrier on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion television.
While this great beauty fair, which is organized for the second time in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been run to Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during her African stay.
This was a real struggle of pleasure.
Beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, were just extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made many experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be transferred live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg on Saturday, from 17 p.m. (15 p.m. in Central European time).
I couldn't imagine any more beautiful land to give my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous experience exchanges with candidates and the discovery of "atemberous landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and safari, the miss now focuses on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to go into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, who was chosen in 1994 and both were Bollywoodstars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organisers, this 59th issue is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates are defiling in traditional cargo and not forgetting, in a bathing suit.
The idea is presented by a television modern, Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty king of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a responsible of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a hardly surrendering warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost with the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was extraordinary.
Unusual for a State Head, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the emission in Cape Town (southwest) to the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise something more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the World Championship 2010, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday, according to his son David, are "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive," his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it's all going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he went out of the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 p.m.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would go to Cedars Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a band disc incident in Paris on 26 November.
This night in Los Angeles, the singer was placed in a artificial coma in order to relief his intense pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was moved by the doctors of the Cedars Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma in which he was delivered in Paris on Monday after a bacterial follow-up surgery on November 26th.
The singer had to undergo a surgery in the night from Wednesday on Thursday due to the sickness changes caused by the last intervention.
On Friday morning, his wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French gymnastry of Los Angeles where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP found.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Hôpitel Pitié-Salpêtriere, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer had a severe burden on the neuro surgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26th.
They explained to us that he made the most pure massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely distressed, explained Mr Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of initiating a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday has traveled "very fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally called this doctor, who assured me that he viewed this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I already had two tape disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematoma after brain bleeding.
But he is also a physician with a doubtful reputation, who has been sentenced several times due to misleading operations and not to be forgotten for tax restraints and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Board of Doctors, called him "a man without screw", who has to be responsible "really" before the Board of Board and "all other things are recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux delivered an explanation on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would have been "perfectly expired" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "collected no bleeding and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been exercising since the last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is too small for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The Parties Association UDF (Union for French Democracy) is energetic and calls on the Party of Nouveau Centre to stop using its seals
On Friday, the Parties Association, which is supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, reacted strongly on an attempt to take the seal, which once was founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the President of the Party of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him to not use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take this UDF seal, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he gave the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to emphasize his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ehemal UMP, now at NC), who claimed the property of the UDF brand, as he first requested this brand at the "Institut national de la propriété industrial" in 2004.
However, the business office of the UDF Party Alliances monitored by François Bayrous' Friends broke the silence and made it clear that they were not escaped and set a deadline to use this seal and to transfer the property rights of the brand to the Minister and the Member under the threat of a judicial persecution.
During the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Partie MoDem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
You also believed that you would have the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the Slogan + of today's UDF +, on their political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, explained the UDF's business office and urged the NC Party to "without delay remove the name UDF from all materials and (her) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette "required to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse this, we will appeal against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories were warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends have "taken the choice" to leave this 2007 to create a competitive movement, as had been done in 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
The Party of Nouveau has therefore, according to the signatories, no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last convention of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
In the case of Hervé de Charette, the business office continues, "he has been no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he applied for the brand name" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the detention of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
In addition, you recall that this ignorance is the best way to transform itself into a crime, and ironizes the NC strategy: "It seems more worthwhile for us in politics as well as in life to make yourself a name instead of trying to get out of anonymity by entering a name that you do not have any legal claims on, in a fraudulent way."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for the exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claimed, he has exploited a weak moment of eighty-year-olds to swallow her part of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weaknesses before the court, a crime that is enforced with a freedom penalty of up to three years and a penalty of 375 000 euros.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this affair that is worthy of the Saga one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter are boiling and at the same time have the crystals of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th chamber arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bedencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The Erbin and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have so far refused to conduct such an investigation, not under the conditions presented by Nanterre State prosecution.
The doctors appointed on Friday should present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you clearly announce whether and at what time Liliane bed court could have been in a condition of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the judgment of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that has to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accused him to have exploited the weakness of her mother for years to swallow a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policy or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane had always opposed bedscourt to be manipulated by the photographer, which she views as a long-year-old friend.
Although the court had to examine the acceptability of the appeal initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyer, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family debt on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "I would like to explain to my daughter that I had written to Banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
I have never been able to speak Françoise since her marriage."
The prosecution of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to react in this way, especially because a court judge has in the last days refused its application to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no fork.
No one has the right to act in their place," the representative of the State Advocate, Marie-Christine Daubigney, confirmed.
The court has now decided to judge after the trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager Revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Instruction?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the position of the management of large enterprises in relation to its employees, the position of the companies has said vis-à-vis to the consumer before the marketing revolution: it is the best for the staff to hang the best as it was previously designed on the consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customers the focus of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets on the site ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much bigger phenomenon, which particularly affects employees.
This demobilisation has a negative effect on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly those of F&E and, even more importantly, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "is calling for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach" by all parties involved.
That is why we call for a operating revolution that would consist in putting employees in the centre of the company's concerns equally close to the customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire which Orange has presented to its payers, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practices?
I'm afraid, I'm not.
- Firstly, because I could find that the whole fabric, in view of a new situation after many reasons, finally reaches the priority to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarism - one of the pathologies of power- proportional to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanical from the major engineering schools.
They take over the old theory of behavior, recently reactived by the US-American "neurological sciences" and unawarely widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "hebel" (sic) for the commitment of employees, a recent survey by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to a mechanical control system that is unqualified for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operating revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is to integrate in any reasoning or practice of governance a basic protocol: for the payers, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears to be clearly a means to achieve a part of its dreams, its ambition and its projects.
The studies from the multifunctional analysis are currently taking over this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a prescribed Doxa, which allows them to estimate what it offers for them to achieve their goals of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, companies' leaders can control, predict and advance their "social performance" and place their human resource management on the right place.
Thus they create a fertile soil which is favourable for the harmonised development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from right
On Friday, the US rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo on the morning and were satisfied that the Peace Nobel Prize 2009 defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had ridiculed the allocation of the price to Obama on October 9 this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former Vice-Presidency candidate in the 2008 elections of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the US Today newspaper, and added that she himself spoke the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs recently published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, held that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I felt that the speech was really good, the former President of the Representative House, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of the wicked in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was consulted in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway", felt that this speech was quite historical.
The previous Member, who is considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to see a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they could "not be free and not pay a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama held a very American speech.
In addition, he represents himself as a "cosmopolite" as he always does, he has "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "live in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," says Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, the former UN messenger John Bolton, a Falke of the era Bush, called the speaking on the website of the National Review Online "awful, high-training and inspirationless".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of armies.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the tempered left continues to be praised on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the nobel price was prematurely forgiven to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The talk in Oslo "will offer a run-out plan for the management of international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says the Californian newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama announced "the necessary discourse" and refers to his speech as "donk and exampleous at the same time".
Fernfahrer: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF – the only employer organization that remained until the end – reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second negotiating night, the negotiators separated themselves early Friday morning in the hope of rapidly signing the agreement at the late morning.
And this, although the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had abandoned the meeting.
However, more than six hours went from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be afraid that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and with 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hour rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small first," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed to stop the supply centres.
"There will, however, always be some contradictors who are not satisfied with the agreement," he supplements.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "though it was difficult to grant these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human understanding and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke of "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3 %, as well as the maintenance of the Total Road Transport Facility in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable it to address the 13th monthly content and the modernisation of tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft law of the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands a " identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement first to apply to the undertakings connected to this organisation and then to apply in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Employment for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employer associations can only delay the procedure.
The United Nations Confederation proclaimed a "deceptive trade" because the EUR 100 million were already promised to the sector to compensate part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but on not to distort the Gans-Esser on the nearby Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the Agreement threatens "to create a large tomb to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, dissatisfied trade unions with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the line RER A, the largest railway network in France for the largest space of Paris and the Île-de-France, continued in the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport management), which will continue to wait with their demands for wages.
On this important shopping week before Christmas, no trains were taken between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and only one of four trains was ready to operate outside the central line.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travelers to climb.
The purchase chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP strives to connect the big businesses technically".
The RER A line goes through the Paris balling room from west to east.
The RATP route section connects the places Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains in the main traffic time was planned, and nearly no one was in the poor time of transport.
As already on Thursday, there was no people's wishes on the railways, since the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had seen the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crossed than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "arose one and a half hours earlier to get to work in time".
The SNCF, which had invested in the care of travellers by staff and order forces, pointed out that there was no entrance at Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove over the Saint-Lazare railway station to ensure the connection to the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the stakeholders took place again, while the results were reviewed that the associations had classified as "necessary" after the meeting with the headquarters on Friday afternoon.
The RER business leader proposed the specific drafting of a RER A-line protocol as regards all relevant aspects, working hours, career courses, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage surcharge.
The CGT was anxious that the RATP itself puts its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership tip "is not able to solve a problem, while this was possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that for Monday, a new meeting was planned for the "wide examination of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again it was the top of the leadership that to date rejected any discussion during the strike, and a meeting after a reassurance of the situation presented.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend to the RER B line after a prediction of Usa and Indépendants.
The associations call for a wage allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and also complain about the worsening of working conditions on this route on which millions of travelers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have a long time of professional experience, are of a gross wage of EUR 2.200 to 2.700, as well as a wage allowance of EUR 600 to 650 for shift services as well as Sunday and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved Pro-Curdisk Party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the Pro-Curdian main party of the country; a decision following immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government's work extremely difficult, which strives to hand the Kurdish community to end the conflicts that have been in 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "place for activities which are disadvantaged for the independence of the State and its unpartable unity", says the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to resolve, and he also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including the chairman Ahmet Turkk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of Parliamentary immunity, enjoying Turky and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the judgment that the parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament rather than to meet par particulate parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court of Justice Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya and accused the DTP to follow the "Weisungen" of Kurdistan (PKK), which is regarded as terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to PKK, however, refuses to mention it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court is working between the government, who is seeking to meet the Kurdish Community and propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds in order to make the support of PKK sealed by the Kurds and to put an end to conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-explosion of tensions in south-east anatolia, where numerous demonstrations had led to conflicts with the police in recent weeks against the cemetery of Abdullah Öcalan PKK.
Since the notice of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the rooms of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mainly populated by Kurden.
The order forces used tear gas granates and water shields when the demonstrations began to throw Molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Turkk assumed that the decision of the Court of First Instance would "be further deepened".
"The Turkey can not clarify this (Curdian, note, i.e. editorial) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party that has been established by the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the conclusion of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," says Minister for Energy, Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a Torpedation of the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government," says the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"Man can obviously react to PKK," he adds.
On Thursday the PKK was an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier, which was one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow breaking can come
A really knocky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Specially so that his employees can try and control the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will take a precise plan.
As soon as it is snow-decking in Frankfurt and temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-ways are rided with large-stroke vehicles, explains Brauburger.
This includes some main roadways, such as the new road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire defenses, open-roads, pedestrian zones and routes, such as the atzelberg road.
The FES service starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which is better liable.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "with which the routes are free until trade starts."
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because no one is willing to place the freight vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it does not continue to snow, the roads are in line with the transport and excavation, including the Council-Beil Streets.
The last priority is side and sideways.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES footing people will take priority on the road, risk points and transitions are cleared.
The FES couldn't take care of all cycling routes.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which keeps the bridges in the eye from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is on this fast glow, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Ways of Dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1,50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long head with sharp, bowed teeth, short arms with seal cranes and a long cock.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday magazine Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about family relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began to dig on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur knees on one day, which is unprecedented for disposal from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new type.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about dino-fruit history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly only individual fractions are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
The dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, why the association of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts are discussing when the legs were divided into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropods, including later the Tyranosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds known as "long-health" four-bone saucods and their relatives, and the plants eating ornithischia (bird basin sauriers), including the types of triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theropod.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, at the head of Tawa Hallae, researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, breathing the birds is more efficient than the mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spinal columns were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge saucods also had air bags and light-building knees later, the common ancestor of both groups probably had produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs have lived in South America, researchers follow that the ecs appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were distinguished early and spread from South America across all the continents that were still the supercontinent of Pangäa.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two more, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrated ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-writer of the Science Study.
Obviously there are also contradictions.
An even older type, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture, because in South America, very many primitive dino fossils have remained, while there is little to find in other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant farmers of the earth's median age, it is still puzzled.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the air sauriers and with numerous other ecstasys.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while relatives died from the Trias to the law.
Success Story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles are not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
Anyway, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite stroke of a group of animals led to the flower that had also developed in the Trias and has been tempted with a shade since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Dozens of Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police rooming of the occupied casino of the Frankfurter Goethe University strikes waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarize themselves with the protesting students at the campus Westend.
In a German and English-declaration "missbillion" they have the police action caused by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had allowed the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the school strike last week because walls and artworks had been decorated.
Five students were injured.
The injuries, judgments of the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers through a police command".
The space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism serves the "delegation and criminalisation of the protest" and disregards the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The dozens demand the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the injury, it says.
Protest legitimated
The youth of the trade unions Verdi and the German trade unions are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landejugendssecretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday on Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of Vandalism, says the CDU lndday delegate Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, this saw the opposition fractions SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the ground to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of considering the arguments and demands of the students, it has been cleared.
The left has made a request that calls on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
Long years she was considered a secret city, unavailable to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret armor research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from the Moscow centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacts with the Frankfurt Science Site Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Bürgermeister Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Deputy Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies will travel to Selenograd for a seminar of scientific funding.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to commit contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronics, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality had been founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plane city" for armament research.
Selenograd (orally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the wooden hill landscape where the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsblock
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than depthing a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will destroy the city of the Baden-Wrttembergian capital for a decade in healthless building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with slides that ended in the middle of the city were then considered as transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brakes of a modern railway, as it once took a huge time to stretch out locomotives from back to front.
Get in, keep a little while, keep going. That's what you want to do.
And therefore the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit railway station, which is located about half a distance of the trans-European rail magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the 'Heart of Europe'.
S21 is now actually considered, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unpaid to implement the depth in the Hessian and the Bavarian city.
However, headway stations have no longer a problem with entry and exit since there are modern turn trains with driving vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
Yet: Stuttgart 21 nest of the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now approached.
Country and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The railway involves, even because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Group.
The project is still quite justified by urban construction.
It creates new city space, which - believes the computer-generated graphics of the planes - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the railway system, S21 is harmful.
The transit railway station and the railways are intended for passenger transport, which is typically the 1980s, a huge growth.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by car on the road.
However, the new construction route does not fit for goods trains because of heavy rises.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also tangs many other railway projects.
Some six billion euros are to be banned in Swedish.
That's the official number.
Experts think that ten to 15 billion are realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing at other node points and enthusiasms in the network.
A total of 60 larger projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the stairway in the time lupentempo.
It would be urgent to press right on the tube here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews the judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in Wiesbaden's country day, whether it will take a revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to make the VGH judgment of more than 400 pages legally reviewed, said Economic Minister Dieter Posh (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had writtenly justified that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Country Railway in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the national government requires, should not be agreed with the legal protection of the population from nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether it is going against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this post and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision at the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig.
The SPD-Fraction Manager Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel asked CDU and FDP to return to their promises before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as "word break".
It's fucking difficult if you can keep your word, said Green-Chef Tarek Al-Wazir in play on the FDP election logic "We keep word".
Minister Posh rejected the assumption of Schäfer-Gumbel, the country government attempting to get to their night flights with "right distortion and tricksing".
A precise legal examination needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure dismissal, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-shaped US-Großbanks strike their state fees.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Bank's Rescue Fund to a total of EUR 45 billion (EUR 30 billion) to a hit.
The Citigroup also plans to refund state aid, according to a report by the US Sender CNBC.
The institutions want to resolve the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of managersboni and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had acquired some $19 billion fresh money from investors on wall loans.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well filled among other things by sales of spare.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money syringe has helped over a very difficult time.
The Money House had deferred to the climax of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
The Citigroup also wishes to obtain money on the capital market in order to be exempted from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a twenty billion dollars heavy increase in its capital, reporting CNBC on circuits.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their help.
Quick choice
It went faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Management Board pushed the official manager Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the transmitter can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the body wanted to vote on staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially in order not to intervene in the procedure.
However, it is also likely that it has played a role to avoid further damage to the ZDF incentives Markus Schacher, nor should this proposal come through to the Governing Council.
Frey, charter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The results of the vote have not yet been found at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to prolong the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, the treaties failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven votted against him. Brender's selection was a defeated defeat for treasures, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had signaled that Brender would not want to confirm in the office for weeks before the election.
Organized the resistance against the chief actors of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that Brender had lost the ZDF's news broadcasts on switch rates, he rejected a further term of office of the hochange-seeing chief actors.
Soon before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was guitarized.
Lastly, even 35 lawyers had intervened in the debate, which considered Kochs' action as constitutional.
It doesn't have anything to do with.
For the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romantics.
Then he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey changed to the ZDF, first to the "now-journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal reference to the manager; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderner of the "mortal magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF external policy; since the head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the choice of Brenders, which was still elected by the Media Magazine industry on Wednesday.
Kochs Widerpart in the Board of Directors, Rheinland-Pfalze Minister President Kurt Beck, explained last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the staff proposals of the intendant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an extraction of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Board with a wise chess train by criticizing the body immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this document of journalistic independence, he could nominate both the treasures without face loss for the position of the manager and elect the Board of Directors without committing suspects to hire a party member in the office.
In any case, Frey is calculated as the left liberals in the party arithmetics.
Study Discouraged
Participation for the students: After a year of educational strike, the Cultural Ministers of the countries finally agreed on Thursday: At a meeting of the Cultus Ministerial and High School Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions in Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to manage their study in future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test burdens: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and ensured "a realistic and reliable scale".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audit services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertaken to make common structures for Bachelor and Master Studies more flexible.
In addition, there should be no different national arrangements.
Reduction of tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Cultus Ministers and Uni-Rectors are carrying the poured word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a specific content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to partially reduce the number of tests drasticly: "Each module usually ends with only one test," it says in a 30-page paper that is intended to re-regulate the approval of study courses.
With the "definite reduction of the test burden", the chairman of the Accreditation Council Reinhold Grimm stated, a "failure development should be inhibited which significantly affected studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will be the "decisive criterion" of design in future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked thereafter" whether "unnecessary implications of students in choosing the
Events" would be avoided.
The students would have "required to receive playrooms that allow and promote own initiatives".
The rules for the authorisation of new, but also the review of existing courses are intended to apply.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, which means that it takes until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
Consistent for this, ten accreditation agencies are all over the entire world subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Cultural Ministers had called on the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies, that the substance fill is not too large and the audit regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and scholarships have already agreed with the Ministries of State on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz granted additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are intended to set up educational programmes and strengthen study advice as well as audit and abroad.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a novelle of the university law to Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The development of studies is to be more flexible, and also to ensure the recognition of performance evidence to other universities and to facilitate access to Master.
By the end of the year, all the study courses of the country are to be checked on their studyability.
On Thursday, government and opposition had again struggled about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso High School Groups called for that educational policy should no longer take place "backside closed doors" of the ministers and universities.
Lastly after the educational strike, students should now also speak as the subjects "a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the HRK, Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Cultus Ministers with which the HRK has a common reform paper.
The trade unions Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that enables each graduate with a Bachelor graduate access to a continuing master study course.
Secondly, the countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor students will have sufficient master studies places with the best possible conditions of study, says GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to set significantly more dozens.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their freedom of access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
Income in Germany and out is pretty hardly no control..." is the start line of a poem of lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing languages the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian banana, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lector in a child book publisher before he transferred to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prices, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University and has been head of the Hessian Literaturforum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt since 2002.
On the last Tuesday, he provided considerable extra literary attention during a meeting in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distortion of their securitisation acts".
Invisiblely insured and abandoned Söllner left a statement in which he admitted to Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Tok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer, his collaboration as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitites.
Together with some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The advertising attempts had started slimly, first in 1971.
I'm, closed Söllner, "so someone who has not defeated enough against the securitisation attempts."
The lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literature scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors originating in Romania will be shocked by a case which identifies the absence and defeat of a political system based on monitoring and speculation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say after the knowledge of the past, not only the deceivers, but also the victims.
In his securities act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllners of the literary scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "go out" him in all of the difficial points for him at that time, says Markel.
It would be a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian Secret Service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cosy reserve for Securitite-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July after reading her own file, 914 pages.
The subjects, you may suspect, are speculated, and in some cases they probably knew what clear name behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and just Walter were hiding.
In contrast to the high-procedural perspective of Stasi acts in this country, dealing with the absences of securities monitoring is still very diffus.
A systematic information has been depressed and disabled in recent years.
One of the Birthler consultants of the National Council for the Development of Securitisation Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the release of the acts has been more sliding since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law that regulates the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former securities members in Romania is still very large proved after the nobel price was notified for Herta Müller an interview in which a previous securitate chef from Temesvar abandoned the prizeholder.
She's got a psychosis, eventually they've only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of opinion.
Surely the case of Söllner, as often as in connection with absence of debt, is inevitable.
Why now? Who was damaged? The sensible reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge demand rather than by debt and shame.
To cure the work of Herta Müller, which received the nobel price yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed that there was just a adrett dressed outside service from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports article manufacturer Goodies had distributed when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment, rose a quarter after midnight to a c-class called.
The man with the magnificent glazzle was driven because of the stranger city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was not eventually in the game, and the 55-year-old was just as low in luck.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is going on.
Or go right.
In the words of the first three days earlier Swiss: "We have reached the eighthfinal," thanks to the 3-1 success of Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded from the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "a lot more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is true to repeat the king-class performance in Mainz in the Liga everyday life.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), brush (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Emission
The Achtelfinale of the Champions League (Incorporations 16./17. + 23./24 February/ Replays 9./10. + 16/17. March) will be released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant objection of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only to the supposed healer who had given the insecured Stuttgart professional in the short time self-confidence, willingness to use and play joy.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and stopped them to be courageous, psychic pumps Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe, which had no effect on therapy but had no effect.
He has unfolded a certain magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "if a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekly injury break thanks to his dynamics as well as the best player at the place, tried to describe the discovered "phenomenon" with the language-writing "fresh wind" and the working way of the new commander: "He is a man who takes through and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the present situation."
It was evidently missing under Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs constance in particular.
Like Gross, players and managers also avoided overestimating the victory against a replacement weak and completely overrequired defence of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, four days later in liver kisses at 0:4 the evil awakening, Khedira gave in mind.
And athletic headship Horst Held admonished that even though a seasonal goal was reached, the other was still in further distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
At his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, Hero was not celebrating in the event of the weekend, which lived freshly in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, which was launched directly before the game.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, hero's harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown leadership weakness to the board and decided to change the trainer on pressure of pubertant fans.
Also that his free day was deleted after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgrace.
Lehmann's statements were "made of pure selfishness", hero resigned and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all others that without pre-working by the dissolved train team, the playish and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a large part of the success," said hero and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Heated Duell in Bern: The Challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title according to the WBC version.
The judgment of the points judges ended unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old Champion, after the version of the Association WBC, in the night on Saturday in Bern conquered the US American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian was already two times the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o., all expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional combats, two times he had to give himself hit because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Around 17.000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2,02 meters of Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left leader hand.
But the 11-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the Duell, repeatedly uncovered the battles of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to the end.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his struggles struck the world champion rarely.
He was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some reversals before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie" who can't do anything right.
The champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson the sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had to release without war.
This year, he forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States at his title defense.
In this fight I only had a struggle and is physically very good in form, Klitschko had founded the fast return to the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The WBA belt, however, is bearing the British David Haye after it was able to throne the 2,13 meters of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had dismissed a fight planned for September before the summer.
It is said that its promotion society is already planning the fight against Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green-Fraction Chief Jürgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the customuz affair.
SPD and left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition of Defence Minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has made a conscious deception.
The minister said to the deadly bombing on two tank load trains from September "consciously the falseness," said Greenen Group Manager Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news post "Tagesschau".
It is called landing: He lied.
The killing order had been issued in contrary to the rules of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that the NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday it had become known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped trucks but also about killing two Taliban leaders targetedly.
The US Air Attack requested by the German Commander Colonel Klein had been killed or injured by up to 142 people, according to the Nato Survey Report.
Greens, SPDs and Left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the federal day and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy for targeted killing is part of the federal government's policy - and whether the Office of Chancellor, Federal Defense and News Service has approved this new strategy - Jürgen Trittin and Greenen-Kollegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm rejected criticism.
The Office of Chancellor has not influenced concrete actions of the Federal War in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry of the backgrounds of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had become loud.
According to the information of SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tank loader attack.
They had officially promised that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and kept the Minister of Sensitive Details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they argued that they had even pointed to the Defence Ministry on several reports, including a two-sided document by Commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wechert is now supposed to have asked in a letter for clarification of the situation, reports the Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper.
He has not received an answer so far, says it.
The Ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this was clarified in the Inquiry Committee of the Federal Day, who is seeking to conciliate on the next Wednesday.
Traum worlds
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychological illness and in drug noise, the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's okay.
If we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can devote ourselves unhinderedly to the wildst ideas and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreams, see and hear things that others do not see or hear in the modern western world are usually considered crazy or drug addictive, at least as a special member.
But such images and voices do not only occur in psychiatric illness or in drug noise.
Debt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint images or write romances sometimes make the limits between dream, wrath and reality fade.
Dream-like changes in wake awareness conditions may occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case Wahn.
Even if triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystery Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophetes Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic depression conditions, psychos and hallucinations can be due to similar processes.
Hallucinations or imaginations occur when the balance of the neuronal substrates of the brain - all ahead of dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin - is disturbed and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complicated hallucinations and stunning thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no longer power over him.
The connection of wrath and dream has been occupied with philosophers and medicines since the age.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatrics, in 1861, a "great similarity of irration with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inaccuracy, wrath forms, senses of such a."
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. transformed into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity has no longer power over him, he's floating on the room cover.
He feels a step.
Behind him, winged devil shapes with blood red, distorted fractures, flashing teeth.
They chase him, strap him with heavy, burning stitches, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Sounds, evil voices drown from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate them, the voices that blasphem him and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo system, knobs them into a snare and sticks them to a ceiling on the ceiling.
He rises to a loudspeaker and lays the snare around his neck.
Jump.
The snippet is loose.
This shall be a teaching for you, and the voices shall cry in a drunken choir, "Go to the clinic, and let you heal!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychos, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
She was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoide psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, the manie, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The fraud images are cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from Schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, subjects are usually not able to distinguish between internal and external worlds, they are admitted to a superior state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Especially widespread is voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is overflowed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasys that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The reality perception in the psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Doctor of the Hospital of General Psychology at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The Schizophrene is located in the centre of the event, everything has a meaning focused on it.
At the same time he becomes a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot act actively.
Therefore, Schizophrene often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality synchronization is usually not possible for them, the fraud images are horrible reality, wake up excluded.
Once in life have experienced a hallucination
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the senseful and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains in principle."
The marvelous thoughts and hallucinations are found in the reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain strikes capriolen, researchers still present mysteries.
Exceptions can lead to short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic emergence to Schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in the subject.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains fuchs.
But there remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neuronal system can be achieved, which at first does not manifest itself over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a cause for psychosis when the disposition is available.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also cause psychos as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
Whether fraud images are felt as pleasant or unpleasant, often is only a question of the view.
Box has been collecting reports about hallucinations and frauds for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying symptoms of psychos, but also of amazing many other diseases.
These include psychic disorders such as borderline or depression often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or alzheimers and sclerosis.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory content that are normally retained.
They arise when the brain runs hot or even when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But as well, we are travelling, stressed, loved, or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that at least once in life a hallucination was experienced.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
During the break it may occur that a slaughtery boy with long, dark hairs do it.
If it answers to him, the schoolmates look at it surprisedly - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think that shy girl is a pounded daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to herself.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy? She asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other fraud images are not real and disappear again.
At night the appearances are mostly terrifying
Often the fraud images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the lesson because the teacher presents in her eyes and ears just a new student, while he explains mathematical equations for all other hearing and visible on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly terrifying.
If she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes too rare and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts of arms and legs, arise from their open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them that they would think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She had the abiture last year and lived with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from rice, he has with great probability after a while hallucinations, says box.
I suspect that the brain is then unemployed and cares for his own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had fear of other children as a little girl, often played her alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Papa since she can think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish affected persons like Sarah K. to differ fraud images and reality. "Every experience," says the box, "become in the brain, the reality occurs there.
Hallucinations are also pictures that cause the brain to develop, so they seem so real."
Night dream images also call box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of health are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike Schizophrenes, psychic healthy people are able to recognize their fraud images as irrelevant.
The box therefore advises its patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too consciously centered world imaginary experience is most pathologicized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Hospital of Florence-Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also stores positive, creative - Wahn is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneiroide form of experience, a special form of trauma-likely changed guard consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer thinks real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake state afterwards.
Oneiroide consciousness occurs in trauma- or illness-related extreme situations, such as polyradiculitis patients who experience motoric paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened of self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a own, imaginary world which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border condition between dream and hallucination.
Since dealing with a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is contradicted in imagination.
An intense form of sense and sense in an inconsistent situation, which enables people to be self-designable not to go into nothing of consciousness loss.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Christ change of heart" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a cardiac pace surgery with subsequent cardiac transplantation travels for days, while his body is condemned to motion in the intensive station.
Clauses are dying into a self-created world, visiting foreign times and places: He experiences himself as a bedsome, old man, on board a train anatorium, a robot watchs his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobles who produce drugs from blood.
A Greek on the motorcycle dragged into its homeland, surfing with his spital bed in the corn snow of the Alps and hits a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined occurrence, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner trips differ basically from every dream for clowns.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental trips are still overwhelming for me after years and in extraordinary details.
Even more clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroides, psychos, hallucinations and drug noise show how broken our inner images of the external reality are also in guards.
Any change in consciousness state, the psychologist reviews box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A experience that can certainly be enriching.
The snow breaking can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing of 27 years of age
The new publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he said to SPIEGEL.
Holding is also supposed to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherited with 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged for the details.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only a question.
The question whether they are able to do so.
You cannot introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
On Thursday, Burda had announced that he resigned from the presidency from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed his follower.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for corporate capabilities and after the exclusion of Jürgen Todenhöfer also came to the responsibility for direct marketing, foreign, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to break over "10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
In view of the cases of fate and shaving, Burda stated that family businesses are not safe before the destruction: "This always concerns families who were infected by a capital search that had completely speculated and thought they could rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "no world power dreams", so Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play with 'time' in the world league, these shops have become too large.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is available to you now.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which has recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2im shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other viewed companies such as Hedonai, who ensure a hairdressing with laser; spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatment; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that produces through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage together with your partner to genius and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxing area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments and for hydro therapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibratory areas.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of customers' training units and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
You start a training unit with the input of a personal password on a touch screen which is opposite the devices.
Afterwards, various videos show you how to perform your training units properly.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating and detonation) are full enough to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained your body, still want to look through the hairdryer salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered to recover hair beauty, glossy and health for your hair in a personalized manner.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 a.m. in the evening 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas moves closer and therefore it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and to get their fixed clothes into our garments.
The form of the dekolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an excessive and very complicated dekolleté. It is only possible to advise.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
Endsa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc..
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and opinions and actions of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to promote the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The Endsa electricity company has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (La Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to take part in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates throughout Europe in standardisation groups and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of rest" for the automobile sector
President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automobile industry, who is the largest exporter of the country, "a Horizon of peace".
In presenting the financial report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero reminded once again of the measures that the government has launched to support the automobile sector during the reign year.
"Without the plan on the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we have today a panorama of negligence and sliding some of our main production works," explained the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automobile manufacturers, also in the future in Spain to produce in a highly competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the production of this industry, which is our large export industry," he added.
He also reminded that the plan for competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in writing on the 2000E plan, which apply in collaboration with the autonomous communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% by average , which in turn led to a "powery growth" in the authorisations increased by 40% in November .

Mazda3 i-stop: Environmental athleticity
Mazda wants to prove that sports is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the i-stop name, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 results from its good notes at the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanic, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are very good in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seat, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomy and good stop.
The game of the wheel is also excellent.
When viewing the unit consisting of the instrumental table and the armature board, you can find that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the magnificent colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend to a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civilics.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civilian, both Japanese models, depart from the necessity of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
The driving stream of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can be comfortably driving the car.
All of this comes to a larger and clearly shaped bagroom.
The stop and access system is only available for the 2-liter gasoline engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It emerges through its fineness, its silent noise, its performances and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in the circulation and its low consumption, even if Mazda is especially the diesel models most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial exclusion, the assistant for driving track change (RVM) produces, which thus removes the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, board computer with a large monitor, sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch fields.
This version also includes as if it was not enough equipment yet, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon lighters and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Facite
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is particularly excellent with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behavior and the diversity of equipment.
They can also buy the i-stop version that is available only with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is a little high price, which is between 21.770 Euro for the luxury model and 23.270 Euro for the sampled model Sportive.
However, the Mazda3 offers us as a compensation for this high price every day to the new highest pass.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided to make a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is also limited to a device that can only read his e-mails without an opportunity to see certain attachments or surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of glory when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the Straße is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is, in particular, of interest to young people.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to abstain from all the data to read their emails as soon as you cross the country border or if you desperately search for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly sedative and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but after my experience, you already need a doctor's title in physics and a good glasses to read all the small printed ones.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission on affordable roaming tariffs for Europe as a whole has almost always been noted.
For the sake of your own country, you always have fear of reading your emails and that rightly.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (which is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it has no wifi/WLAN) can offer this kind of tariffs means that the telephone providers need to think slowly, but safely, and begin to consider different possibilities how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and other requests is included on the Internet.
Without vegetation and without crochets.
It is an Internet-appropriate device and one pays for it only one time, namely when buying, and not monthly.
And that is exactly what I expect from FonPeek to buy with lifelong Internet access as it already offers the Peek in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
Unless I expect this, because I think it would be a more suitable model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at Barack Obama's office as president of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and have chosen the same color again to accompany him with his, no doubt, second important moment in his life: the granting of the peace nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has carried similar models at both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the dress consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and thereby she carried something largely sticked or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at the first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ very differently in the fabric of which they are made.
When she was introduced, she was wearing a dress of top and in Oslo one of patterned seeds.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and for the second time an endless model, but gold colored.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was upstairs at this occasion as a hair crash, the previous time she was carrying the hair open.
75% of the employed mothers have had problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
This result is the study of women's fertility and career in Spain, conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 makes no doubt about this: 75% of women in employment see their career benefits in the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if yes, what kind of profession they do.
Those of them who do not do any other activity, work only half-day or have no fixed working contract are more mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women move with a firm employment, especially in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood, and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment receive their first child in average only 3.7 years after the gathering, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with firm employment, who have long needed to achieve this, and who have taken her together and the first child has achieved much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar for preception,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when women are married and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is increasing, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group aged 35 to 49, depending on whether they have only primary school graduation or higher education, averaged 25,1 or 32,1 for the first time.
Furthermore, depending on their educational level, there is another difference between women.
While the women with the main graduation are marrying before their first job and getting their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation make it exactly different, seeking a firm and then marrying their first child, finding Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the generally known advertising term "Because you are worth it".
The main actress of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous dependent sign as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones allowed to join this exclusive club were the actors of the Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In the men, the cosmetic company has only exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey (" Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (the Gospel's play colleague in "Lost").
The price supply of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual price allowance held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason, they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which has been chosen for the best model this year.
Manuel Vicent's poker game
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) the three-sized X-ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear-influencing genre (cort biography, life and work), but seeks an endlessness to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not spare fears or relief.
Auβer that this book is a delicious lecture, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost senseful desire, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy contrary to unhealthy fate, the moral without debt and the innocentness without any God."
Concerning Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, a all-gorian Christian, he wrote about what he had in blood, not in his mind, between power and ignorance, with a crushing poetical humor, without any sense, like the knife that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband, with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, was drawn into their ban, in whose flesh the emotions were united with the pleasures of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come into heaven on the way of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, which is one of the 8000 summits in global literature, you have to climb up at the north wall, on the wall, where you always try the best mountain climbers on the new."
About William Faulkner: "He was a strange cake.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a good-owner of the county and again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born from a certain grea."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy scream that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would lead to his literary way until the night of the 20th century. This he made on a trip on which he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence before the worms pleaded to the neighborhood.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knee and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "These verses of Spencer are buried on his grave: 'the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunder of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a satisfied life you find pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her baggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Eduard VII spioned them between the Azales or sang the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much more important than her crazyness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than trying to invite Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he didn't bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy that man's glory, so that he might put himself on this pod?"
Cool aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district last week in the village of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people from 15 to 18 years of age left next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we have taken out of the animal home and weighed just six kilos, and then they missed him from warmer heavens and hurt him hard.
Our disarmament cannot be perceived in words, as it is ununderstandable for us, because it is supposed to be the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal that has been carried out on the line of course.
In addition, a woman who walked cosyly was given the anguishing attack when she wanted to correct those people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because when such a crazy person attacks a dog, he may be the same with a woman, a child, an older Lord, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The event occurred in a normally quiet city district at 5:00 a.m. on a very common Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have advertised at a nearby police service, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring something at all and prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we only want to clarify that the fierce criminals were Spanish.
Our disarmament over the occurrence has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the heads of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial) the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as it is ultimately the only protection element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "except includes more than just the design and manufacture of products that become safer every day" and continued to confirm that it also contributes to a step closer to this goal every day with other actions on education and information.
This new campaign for the promotion of helmet use on the motorcycle running under the "Tobe or not to be" strike will be distributed in a first phase to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a tyre manufacturer for two-cycle vehicles, it is always obliged to be one of its main objectives to be the development of increasingly safer products.
Sales of small cars rise slightly again
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in reference to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, with the numbers presented by the manufacturers' association of Anfac and Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be geniused with great caution, since the reference data used to compare November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year with a decrease of 60% in relation to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, except for the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months remain 40 % below the sales rates of the previous financial year.
Since January a total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number, all vehicles consist of the small transporter market are included: cars of passenger cars, pick-ups, small cars, small cars and lighter cars/carriers.
In addition, the same clouds are still the same in the sky, which mostly draw the demand in compassion, since while some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the largest part of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises that are working on a third-financing purchase in almost 100% of all cases.
This requires further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the continuation of the poor economic situation, to be included in these restrictions, which are the result of the reversed cash facility of credit institutions.
In this panorama and in contrast with the passenger cars, financial support has helped little in buying a vehicle from the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, even self-employed and small companies have the right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 exhaust which may not exceed 160 grams per travelled mile, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential to focus on these small loaders and, of course, on industrial vehicles (last cars and buses).
The car dealer association predicts a year similar to that of 2010, for which it is expected with a sales failure (for passenger cars and terrain cars) of 19%.
Support for brake manövering in critical situations is now required
As with the ABS anti-blocking brake system and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control, the aid systems for braking in emergency must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and small carriers, for the remaining vehicles a carence period was established by the end of February 2011.
The European Union's measure is aimed at improving the protection of the foot-and-mouthers, but these brake systems can also help to prevent many accidents because of their working manner.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake manoeuvre which recognizes the system using the brake strength performed by the driver on the brake spedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an inquiry by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident, before the collision, did not come to the brake spedal and half of them had not been completely broken down.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid takes the brake system with maximum power, thus reducing the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car leaves during the brake process.
According to a EU study, up to 1.100 fatal accidents injured by Fuβ passages could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that every fourth accident with personal damage could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time it has a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake spedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the crash is inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible in this way.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Rilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to conclude the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Rilly, the new President of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already agrees on each item of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be moved by the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that there will be a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car builder so that it can take a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper port cars, which has a Russian group of Converg back coverage, is increasingly awarded.
If there should be an agreement with none of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will also continue to be maintained.
On the control of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, engineers used the Boxster S as the foundation and really managed to make it easier around 80 kilos, with which he now brings only 1,275 kilos to the scale.
In order to create this, they first rejected the automatic relapseable roof, which was replaced by a tent leather roof with manual drive, so that 21 kilos were saved alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappearing" another 15; by removing the air conditioning, the fuel tank has already been reduced from 64 to 54 litres to 54 litres, so the installation of sporty baquet seats has saved five more of them.
Then, by the absence of the CDR-30 audio system, six kilos of less and by the exchange of door handles, the missing kilo had been reached by grips of substance.
Although it is also available with the double coupling drive PDK, the sampling was carried out with a vehicle with 6-passed hand drives, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain routes that really were very curved.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note in vain.
However, the reduction of its weight has not led to the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the Straße.
It's rather the opposite of the case: we haven't been proofing such a small and easy model for long ago, which at the same time gives you a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low walk in the required time until we give him the orders to raze, brake, recover and then get back to the new thing out of his engine ...
He's doing everything they tell him. The car does everything we say to him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all taste directions
The sound of his V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used at Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration ability is unprecedentedly brutal, whether from standing out or when accelerating again.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraßen, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route, and that, although we found some of these curves in the morning grey and rolled in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultrasmall car, a car with which you have an incredible driving pass, as it is rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and costs 70.831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stability as their bags of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 at his visit to the complicated Fuβball field of the Maccabi Electra, and thus come to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight three times the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Mrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and team work, even if they were waiting for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 rated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the bluerotes, which sat at the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already expected that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different only that the team from Álava decided to play Barac inside and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the team with peppers and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to emphasize himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" review of Splitter already assumed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Yet, despite the clear advantage in the break, the Makkabians had not yet decided, and the Makkabians wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their playground, and thanks to the ever-taking "hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "gulves" turning the rod (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few toys with meeting security to get air again and with one of them, suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive threefolds and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the advertising table was displayed a relaxing distance from (54-67), which the host could reconcile with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
In the last quarter, the Alavesen were bloβ, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, resigned and tried to return their crew through three points from the line (70-77).
Yet, while dividers were placed on the ground for Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended well and even though the Israelis had recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a victor and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being commanded
Unicaja lost loudstark in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the group B of Euroliga, and that in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which facilitated the Greeks.
The team from Málaga was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opponential team, which might be one of the strongest Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggresive defense and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts bleached with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of one Unicaja, although the local crew with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis made it possible that the advertising table in 13 minutes 22-20 announced its favours, the minute in which it had almost come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began finally to get warm and its superiority on both play halfs, while the excretion of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in Unicaja.
Among their players in the interior field and the Lithuanian preplayer Linas Kleizas, with its three-folds, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
It was impossible to hunt up
The third play area was characterized by many attacks against the crew of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27 minutes, which brought the leadership within the group into the fluctuation.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the excretion of the scots that were injured during the game Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came back in the 31st minute thanks to the feathering and the threefolds of Cook and the use of Lewis a little hope to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, as soon as it attacked and his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was not to be braked.
In the 37th minute, the Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be hit and had to take off the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
The users of Facebook can now learn their salary, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 jobs available in Trovit in Spain. Users are available in Facebook, where they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after one week, after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "badly paid," explains the product Trovit Responsible, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the most poorly paid, according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross amount of EUR 45.226 and a French 31.059, in contrast to the 24.000 euros a Spanish earner.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is a service provider with an annual EUR 11.592 net; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and the worker with EUR 15.667.
The most visited services on the Internet in the last three months are the ones of a driver, half-day offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date for leaving
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President of the Office shall leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian message in the Honduran capital, confirmed to the television broadcaster TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before this date, he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27, as his mandate runs this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The transmitter also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the fixed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back coverage of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (which proclaimed Porfirio Lobo as a victory), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message by January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed to reject Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of a asylum seeking politician, which the "de facto" government under the chair of Roberto Micheletti wanted to force him.
Thank you.
After the most exciting days since the past spring, where the inflation of the assets was the dominant atmosphere on the markets, the insecurity has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural condition, in a environment in which the makers make decisions on one of nature of uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly allow liquidity to be free of hand in interests moving around zero so that banks can buy assets for billing.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to spread some sand into the drive, as the BCE has already done with its yearly increase, the next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will just be witnesses of a reverse in reducing risk premiums.
The refugees of the stock exchanges and the differences in business bonuses rise again, even though they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to state the private risks and state debts rise again.
It is now reassigned to quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area in respect of Germany.
Up to now, Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had again tried to reduce a consciousness among the world economic policy officers for what they had caused, since they had declined the devastating effects to which the limitation of loans led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to have decided a new day for thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the emirates and the development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government, which avoids government debt, elections and a new government that moves on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for auβerusal measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are before a episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excavations to too high amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonuses.
However, if the European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish increased further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators force a large part of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, who come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, do not promise all of this, despite warnings, a long lifetime.
Again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "be careful on driving" is said.
Associated branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, came first yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where in these days the strategy on energy supply of Spain will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave the press some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest EUR 50 billion and another 60 billion from this date until 2030, under the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola feels that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity but in distribution networks and international associations.
As from 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and carbon plants with facilities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the preliminary suspension naturally by other "supplies".
Galán, who believes that the draft text for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is in a line with what its company demanded, in no case would say anything against this law, as to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
He believes that, in spite of some of the specific actions, the "long-term approach is clearly set to this direction, as she describes the chairman of Iberdrola.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even though they are long-term, should be taken now, as it will need some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the "trading" from Aer Lingus on ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flu Company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, has been made at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Kastilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation for the creation of an innovative centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the survey of energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the granting of its first motorway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and a motorway operator.
The city administration wishes to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the management of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) has decided to forward the project according to a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the management is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and wall management.
In expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), while in the last phase three consorties, mainly European construction companies, compete with each other.
The group named Transcity is addressed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second with its seat in Italy is one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct is joined by the British company Laing O'Rourke, Australian Transfield, responsible for infrastructure and the French bouygues group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (daughter company of the German construction company High depth, which is again ACP), also local Baulerstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger group) and the French company Razel, specialized in public construction.
The Australian Infrastructure Market promises huge construction and privatisation, however, has a barrier to overcome, as it is only through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies mentioned in high depth or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that must only be followed by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACS have gained access in this market only by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona is very important to this geographical area for the industry, where it is already known as the energy supply provider and in the sales industry due to its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies in charge of building and managing the disposal plant of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground railway, supported by the city of Brisbane infrastructure office, is designed to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the circuit railway in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 km through tunnels, which is the largest measure for stauring on the Strasbourgs of Brisbane.
The road plan issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Although this route is intended to open for traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will last until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two trails in each direction, an electronic wall system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
Brisbane is already a big business for high depth.
Australia forgives high depth that yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, repeatedly considerable contracts.
The ACS sub-Company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the building project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not started yet and high depth has received 129 million for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has delivered its subsidiary Alpine, building a tunnel over 2.1 km length for a motorway in Slovenia over the amount of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the supplement for the construction work to extend the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine enhances its experience in the tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives Renfe advertising
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra. Rushmore Agency over a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
This Treaty also provides the possibility of two extensions of each 12 months. Sra. Rushmore has been selected under 16 agencies which have been presented to the competition of Renfe, 4 of which have come to the end, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be assigned to design and manufacture of campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom for the outbreak of competition.
France's Competition Regulatory Authority has imposed a penalty of EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed networks and mobile phones through the signing of exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than EUR 560 million in punishment since 1994 because of disabilities for its competitors.
The punishment that was imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority who guards competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar understandings in the past and has therefore reverted.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenues from businesses that do not operate from the telephone connection.
In principle, this site is active in Orange in France and the United Kingdom.
It must be waited until 2010 until this victory will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça in 476,4 million since the beginning.
Since 1992, the Champions League has developed a source of revenue for the Fuβball Club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the Fuβball clubs, which have earned most money in the Liga.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of the UEFA, not only brings glory with itself. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from the large associations.
According to the UEFA, the Liga has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is on the third place of Europe, who has earned most money through its participation and who next to AC Milan is the only one who won the trophy three times.
The President of the Catalan Champion and last winner of the former Cup of Europe in 1992 proves the fifth place.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern München, two crews who also took most money through their participation in the past Champoins League.
And that, although they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only at the third place of the countries that were able to gain money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated cash allocation procedure applied by the UEFA.
During this financial year, the organisation whose chairman Michel Platini is in charge of the Champions League calculates with revenues of 1.090 million.
Of this money, the UEFA 413.1 million provide for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualifications round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested, those who fought to participate received 3.8 million by their bloβa presence.
There is also a bonus for gaining (80,000 euros) and for a distinct (40,000 per crew). The clubs that have come into the eighthfinale receive three million each; the four who have come into the quarterfinal, 3.3 million.
The last four receive 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus a football club receives at least 7.1 million and not more than 31,2 million fixed revenues.
Barça again earned 2.5 million with his victory at the European Supercup in August.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money will be allocated proportionally to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places allocated.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games it plays during this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has made details about the purchase offer of shares that would allow them to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage which does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In fact, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid to ten years and with a rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real review of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez group gives the shareholders a 15-day period to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it has not been informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had come in contact with the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254,27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructuring his management.
When trying to stay on the edge of possible purchases and the judicial crossings of his ex-manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal book examination.
A decision that makes her the first woman who has a high post in the food company.
It is a newly created post which is directly understood to the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from polemic because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of redirection of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos moves further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the loan of Salazar, Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (Representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) came before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion of Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the Investment Company Mer for Federico Paternina last 9 October.
The supervisory authority declared that it approved this tender after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the laws and, therefore, the content of the declaring document, after the amendments made last 2 December, can be considered "excessive".
CNMV has also informed that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares from Federico Paternina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is 8.95% of the company capital, comprising from 6.142.786 euros in shares approved in Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also noted that 5.592.778 million shares have been fixed which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender and the price of which Federico Paternina has been established in accordance with the laws of law.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of accidents and accidents not only deserve the KFZ workshops
Every day thousands of vehicles involved in an accident will be dragged into the workshops where a reporter has to evaluate the damage caused and the costs of repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of the costs for parts and working hours can be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the reporters use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and provide them with their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American Group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for assessment and development of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work on the data provided by the manufacturers is all other than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are collaborated, each of them provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed will be increasingly larger until the point that more versions, variants and engineizations have been placed on the market in the last five years than in the last fifteen years.
Once a new car comes on the market, business starts work.
It is a difficult task, because each one of the thousand vehicle parts must be catagolized and entered its price.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a highly sold model, work can be completed in a week if the procedure is rapidly ahead.
If this is a less usual car, it can take up to three or four months. At present Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain of full information.
For example, the exclusive models include information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the Straße, it is more than 99%.
For the purposes of the implementation of documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (usually experts for mechanics) working at the same time with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros each year in the preparation of these databases.
Each month they collect 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or remaining value of a car.
The only company that is about a driver who informs about the value of the cars used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
In view of the products offering Audatex, you can easily get an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, whereas the star of the products is AudaPlus, a standard solution to assess accidents for the reporters.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
For the costs of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the sales prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who seldom use it at most ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly band using the driving chair number.
AudaGlass is busy with the vehicles, and AudaSubastas is an Internet service that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analysis or in order to obtain information about deviations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a certain car brand have been involved in a serious accident during a certain period, due to pans, or how many of them have been involved in a serious accident.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt estimates, which are also intended for reporters and deliver to the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Group Einsa, which was founded in 1971 as a provider for services and solutions for assessing damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT driver for opinions is a reference product on the market.

Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and the turnover in 2008 was 10.8 million euros.
In the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of a office in Paris.
On the other hand, Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

Increase of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of getting access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, advisors, car rental companies, workshops, garbage places and car dealers, which must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reporters today.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day on the Spanish market.
According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose driver number has been logged off may no longer drive to the Straßen, but certain not damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
However, the vehicles with historical value may be authorised again, even if they have been logged off after difficult authorities.
Preliminary estimates of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company ensures Audatex that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:Identification of the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older experts who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger motor vehicles, 109 terrain cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small carriers and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the driver number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for working hours, charges or discounts, and afterwards he can print the cost estimate and pass on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool to evaluate such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, a amount that the customer can pay without any further payment.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation, the car mechanic has been waiting for a long time, for example, because you can choose a door with it and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
