Mamming: Corona Mass Infection: 174 Harvesting Helpers Specified
After a corona mass infection at a large vegetable farm in the down bayer Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the operation.
A security service monitors the procurement.
A total of 174 harvest assistants were tested positively on the Corona-Erreger Sars-CoV-2, as announced by the Dingolfing-Landau Land Council on Saturday night.
"In order to avoid further spread, we must go this step to protect the population," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the cause of the series test.
The plant is a large vegetable farm that grows soil bears, gurkens, carbon and red beet - but only for enclosure glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "After our information, it is a closed person circle."
In the court, infected by non-infected employees were separated, the site is now surrounded by an asperrstone.
Green and SPD gave the government responsibility.
The two opposition fractions, Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet, were prompted to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenge if such local infections have to be interrupted and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "We have already requested a special control programme for farmers with harvest helpers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof Schlachthof Mitte May," said the Environmental Expert Florian von Brunn.
"Just the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be carefully controlled from our perspective.
This has obviously not happened."
The outbreak has come "with an application".

Report: Seehofer calls for longer storage of stock data
The storage of stock data is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer demands an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He is thus trying to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for a renewed storage of stocks - instead of the planned ten weeks a half year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a rapid change in law.
Seehofer therefore wants to reinforce the measures against child abuse.
He believes it is useful to "have necessary adaptations to the law already now," quotes the newspaper from the letter.
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
A decision of the EAGGF is expected to be made.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, says the report.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper that it could only be reasonably examined whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the internal ministers of the countries had already spoken for storage of stock data in June.

Southerly speaks after mass infection to Corona-Lage
Munich - Minister for Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a thermal sive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our website.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvest assistants from several countries are currently working, more than one third has infected with the Corona disease.
The court is now under quarantine and is locked up with a building town.

"Conscience bite": confession of Nante's suspected burner
"My Mandant has shown himself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added, "He regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plowed by conscience bites and very much included in the extent of destruction".
In the case of a condemnation, the man, according to state prosecution, threatens ten years of prison and a penalty of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Sankt Peter and Paul cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in the night on Saturday last week at a fire.
The fire was broken out on three remote places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of burning.
The suspect now had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the morning of the fire.
Since there was no evidence of a violent intending into the church, he quickly came into the perspective of the detectives.
Discussion about the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended to consider the elimination of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission makes the facts complete," said Grindel of the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can become hazardous at the earliest Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not even work: see Leipzig or liver kisses.
In that respect, you do not come around the debate, whether it is not necessary to make associations that want to break into this Phalanx facilitate the integration of investors."
However, he doubts whether there is the willingness in the German football Liga to allow majority participations prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Federal Liga.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment zones in a European internal market to the Federal Liga economy," said Grindel.
The former DFB-Chef sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Federal Liga at the end only lead to weakening the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not to be more excited in the championship".
Even a equilibrium of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are enormous only among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and passed through to the press instead of speaking to me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to its withdrawal in April 2019.
"I've been very busy by humans."
The gift in the value of approximately 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian functionary.
"I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw out the consequences," said Grindel.
"I have handled the immense watch gift completely transparent and indignantly.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it."
He never made a hole out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This can be called naive, anyway, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time champion Tony Martin can imagine to continue his cycling career.
"I'm just setting out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".

Argentina rejects the counterpart of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible but also unfair," said a statement.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer liable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on his private creditors to refrain from some of their claims of approximately $66 billion (circa EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state's pleasantness.
It would be the nineth payment failure in the Argentine history.
Lastly, creditors had demanded higher interest rates on public loans and changes in certain contractual clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, holds its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
Inflation rates were last more than 50 per cent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by approximately 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not compensated interest claims of 503 million US dollars and was thus cut into a limited payment decline.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It's going super good" - this phase moves Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end everything went very fast: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will enter the success of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notariats.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the promoviered jurisdiction took up the work, the normal daily business runs long on full tours.
"Privately, however, I have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler advertiser and laughs.
The short preliminary period has, of course, not enough to completely transfer the food point of Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the bored Dingolfinger.
At present, she is with her husband, who is a judge in Regensburg at the court of the land, looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental time in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to need to pendle from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has a night-night possibility with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Of course, grown up in the neighboring country circle, the city Eggenfelden has been a concept for a long time.
When she visited locally with her family in the past months, she then recently discovered: "Eggenfelden is a pretty small town."
She was more pleased that she had made the race in the selection procedure around the free place.
She also played a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's vocational course in her homeland Niederbayern: After the Law Study in Passau, she conducted her reference period and the second State degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as a note-race ssorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - in this time she also trained the promotion in labour law - she entered her first place as a noter in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went to parental age, followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she took over representative services in various notariat posts.
When the body was postponed in Eggenfelden because of the nearing retirement of Lutz Feller, it has seen the right time for full professional return, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the Notariats, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer fully - and has a commendation for the crew of the Office ready: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In the case of children's gardens and cripping places, it has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to go through her hobby soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Red Valley.
BVB is planned for liga start with a maximum of 15 000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football city in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the seasonal start in the event of a fan return.
"As a result of the distance system that is compulsory, we are planning the current position with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmund's manager Carsten Cramer the "day mirror".
Usually, the arenas in the district town at Bundesliga games have a little more than 81,000 viewers.
In the spirit games caused by the Corona Pandemy of the past season, the BVB per party had lost about four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal observer places, some of the about 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a battle in the office if these revenues are completely broken away."
In view of the continuing Corona crisis, all of us are currently "advised to take a stable side for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need for entertainment is limited," said Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chef praised the BVB professionals for their wage deficiency, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their pay absence has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work."
Small wonders: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Nearly heavyer than a packerl butter, just once three dining spoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he wog exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 mornings that are taken care of annually at the Grazer Children's Hospital.
One quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestinal, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so small that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially designed mini winds for them.
But not so small that they weren't with voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smelts.
"Even if they of course don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite the Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage, the 9th classes of the Sankt Jakobus gymnasium in Abtsgmünd were experienced shortly before holidays.
Actor Julia Sylvester from the Aalen City Theatre presented the production of "The Home Dress" by video to the students.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and the performance.
The idea was born for the performance format from the current Corona Situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar welcomed the enrichment of the teaching.
Although at the end all stakeholders agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would still offer additional irritation, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game business," stressed director Winfried Tobias.

Kalbitz-Routf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Figenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "figure sheet" from the FDP view and does not change the character of the party.
"AfD is the parliamentary arm of legal extreme in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only a part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP Indian politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after several hours of negotiation, the Federal Court of Justice of Afd had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided mostly in May.
Kalbitz is the Chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburger Landtag.
"If it would really be about removing legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his followers would have been long been excluded," said Strasser.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz remains excluded now says nothing and does not change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It is rather speaking of how many frenetic supporters have a legal extremer in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will return to less than five percent in the future in elections.
"The days of the afd in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the wording leaders of the officially dissolved "flight" around the Thüringer AfD-Landes- and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection entails the radiation as a "safe legal extremist strain".
In May, the AfD Federal Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not specify a former membership in the now banned legal extreme "Hmattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Calbitz is a member of the HDJ.
The Chairman of the Left Fraction in Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Schiedsgericht does not change the character of AfD: "The Wolf has only eaten cream.
The AfD remains a right-extreme party, whether with or without calfitz."
This decision will neither weaken the Federal Party nor the right wings.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troop is clear.
You want to avoid further observation through constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
There's nothing to change,” commented Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD Lands Association and the Group held up to this day as their right leader."
The legal dispute about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he was now going to take civil law against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Windparks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea have injected electricity in the network 11.51 terawatt hours.
This is about 21 per cent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet informed in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transferring the North Sea power to the mainland and transit through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the tennet network, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
The wind flow from the North and East Sea is thus 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Thus, wind harvest is almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of the offshore wind energy is given in addition to the wind conditions of higher production capacity, because new wind parks have gone to the network over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate 6,7 gigawatt electricity.
The transfer capacity is sufficient for it; it is according to tennet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
By 2030, it is intended to rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we invest 20 billion euros in the development of offshore network connections," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not exhaust their capacity on lake, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea Wind Parks produced more than six Gigawatt electricity.
Averagely, the North Sea wind wheels produce 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration at 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with the works of Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual frame after the Corona break.

North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" engaged.
Freetal: Windberg Festival cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital abandoned the three-day feast planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city feast.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in consciousness, how difficult it is for the stakeholders - hoped until the last minute," explained Oberburgermeister Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But finally we are responsible here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands had flown to the mainland and to the festival, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be respected in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that a people's festival would not have left much.
In addition, organisational and monitoring efforts would rise by a proportional increase.
Rumberg trusted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things, with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressure olympics valueh not to beat in aerial direction
Achleiten - The six-time Olympiador Isabell Werth was the superior rider at the Dressur Tournier in the Austrian Achleitung.

More flight lots in Worms
The Worms University continues in the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" founds a professional for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first completed for three years and started in 2021.
With the professional, it is possible not only to allow the start of the study in the summer, but also to be a winter semester.
This allows you to train twice as many students as you have previously.
At the same time, both in the university and in the DFS Air Safety Academy are equally exhausted.
The DFS will consult the university in the establishment and occupation of the professional.
Representative at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in their training for flight lots at the University of Worms have been in the course of Air Traffic Management.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experiences of DFS are very positive, the benefits of students are excellent.
The combination of studies and lotsing training contributes significantly to increasing the attractiveness of the lots' profession.
"In these times, we do not find it easy to promote economically.
However, we are sure that air traffic will be recovered and long-term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal task in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professional is a future-proof investment that airlines will provide on the long term a broad, technically comprehensive knowledge base.
We therefore continue to cooperate with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as employers."
This also underlines Professor Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University: "The Foundation Professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her, we want to connect to the existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practice partner for the dual Bachelor study course Air Traffic Management."
Confidence of German air safety is for the University of Worms Motivation and commitment to further expand their teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In use for tomorrow's flight lots, the university with the first foundation professional for a dual course of study could set very special highlights and innovative highlights for their students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stressed: "The University of Worms has a single setting in Rheinland-Pfalz with its focus on air transport.
Today's signature of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue hub lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes the motorway A 45 was fully locked towards Askapburg on Saturday morning, since after a traffic accident of the rescue hubs was in use.
A 76-year-old drove straight out in the curve with a Ford at 12.40 o'clock in the Alzenau middle and landed at the lead planke.
As a result, the frontair bags resolved, the driver suffered mild injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old accompanyer were provided by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital following the rescue hub.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle with an injury of approximately 2000 euros had to be disappeared.
Healing seeks to examine other industries in the meat industry
The Corona crisis again revealed the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative enlargement is about to come.
But are they right - and will it remain there?
Federal Minister for Employment Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors according to the strict rules on misuses in the meat industry which are now planned.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," said Heil der Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns that work contracts are generally restricted.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the flesh-great tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinett wants to decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
In the case of slaughtering, destruction and meat processing, large slaughter farms shall no longer be allowed to use foreign staff.
It is intended to prohibit the use of work contracting and lending workers there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and employee surrender, if you do not want to delay the economy completely."
Work contracts, for example, are compulsory for large areas of craft, construction and plant construction, the basis for their value added to customers.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban working contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat economy holds a prohibition of work contracts and lending work alone in its industry as constitutional.
It should not be explained why, in future, the portioning and packaging of cheese should be subject to other labour laws than in the case of wurst, a opinion on the law project as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Sunday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many East European workers from work contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of a review of the NRW work protection management partly 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
The salary was kept for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
But "tricky constructions" would have overcome these.
"Now we need to be fundamentally cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, measures which do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher rates of checks in the field of labour protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The draft, which is present, includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat economy and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I wish we could do more controls in many supervisory areas: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, more controls also require more staff.
Three dead in the crash of Ultralight aircraft in Germany
At the crash of an ultra-light aircraft to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German Federal Country of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people have died, according to the police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people had been rescued in the accident, said a speaker of the circuit headquarters Wessel.
A fallscreen was found at the accident site, says the police.
The "Rheinian Post" reported, calling on eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had crashed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were first not known.
Rooming of Frankfurter Opernplatz in peace
One week after the excursions in Frankfurt, the rooming of the opera site is also peaceful in the night on Sunday.
Recently, some dozens of people stayed on the spot, but before the start of the blocking hour at 1 o'clock, they left him.
Since the early evening, the police had been in operation with numerous officials, seeing a larger police order throughout the city area.
The first time on this weekend, from midnight, was a ban on the opera place on which a week ago there was crushing.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the quantity of celebrators.
At least five officials were injured after police data, damaged several police vehicles.
The night on Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overflows: Young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar severely injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the Clinic Kassel.
With heat cameras, the firearm sought possible carriers.
The woman, according to the police on the Federal Road 83, was on the way to her home, when her car came off the railway from unexplained reasons and surpassed several times.
To save the defects, the fire force had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent maize field was searched from the rotator with a heat camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, also working with heat cameras, had been ordered for the search.
However, the forces found no one between the high maize plants.
The injured one was brought with the rescue car to the Kasseler Klinikum for further supply.
Almost 50 forces of the firearm Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a refreshing gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian mastership for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-fold world footballer made the total 36. Scudetto of the United History perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which has been announced without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing two play days before the end of the season of series A.
The Table Second Inter Milan is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half time, then Ronaldo met after a free shot variant with the last action.
A example of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the criminal space border directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shot, the Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This guaranteed the shiny but decisive success.
The foulelf metre that was fired at the Latte in the 89th minute should only have been violating Ronaldo itself with a view to the gate hunter rating correctly.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically for 90 minutes on ball height.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said Trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the spiritual exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve-Coach.
Due to the defeat, the tourists had not yet been able to make the mastership perfect.
At the end, Juve had to be given the weakness of competitors, especially because of the calming predominance at the top of the table.
For in the 11 games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only succeeded five victories.
Whether Ronaldo is still going to be the king of Toraldo, it is a question.
For during the Portuguese Superstar until 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after its three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of Lazio Rome tabled at Hellas Verona already had 34 meetings on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title winner of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples season 2015/2016.
In August, the "old lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus stands at the Champions League's eighth finale, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon has to wear a 0:1-hintpleite to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal authors
Stuttgart - All threatened punishments and court judgments, despite the number of illegal races on the bath-wrttemberg streets, car drivers continue to gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
Comparable values for the years before are not available, but the razers are making the judicial authorities more and more work: In the public lawyers between constanz and Mannheim, 155 investigation procedures were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until early June 151.
The races were less about organised events, as the response from the Ministry of Interior to a question of the country day's GDP.
In most cases the drivers were spontaneously attacked against each other or they had taken the escape from the police - also that is shown as an illegal race.
In particular, German men aged 18 to 60 were sitting at the tax.
113 penalties - 15 times penalty
Only in relatively few cases, the razers are caught and also asked for the cabinet: The Ministry of Interior has been devoted to a total of 113 punishments since 2018 and 15 freedom punishments have been issued.
However, there are no suggestions that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Instead, other car drivers responded more sensitively than before because of the tragic accidents and processes in recent years, and showed more frequently, said a ministerial speaker.
Especially popular with racing, the 8th automobile train is always braking out the traffic there to provide space and to use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen of drivers near Kirchheim were taken under teck, three months earlier, even 18 drivers were at the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
At the A81, the police register even more races than any other federal motorway.
With a temporal limit there is attempted to broke out the racing on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-prise and oppressed sports and luxury carosses often have Swiss marks because drivers, because of the high punishments for fast driving and authors in the neighboring country, differ from racing to Germany.
For the SPD, the temporal limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general tempo limit of 130 hour kilometres we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD-Landday fraction.
"The inhibitor threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be legally here and there with 200 kilometres of hours and more on the way."
Rivoir feels less about information or image campaigns: "Wer does not just risk his own life, but also the life of other carriers is not yet reachable by reason of reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police interference
At the same time, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that Raser will not be disturbed by the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harder checks on the routes concerned.
Uncommonly, the high-turn force measure makes painful and follow-up seriousness: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country died at the races, two of them unaffected at a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city and one in Gerlingen.
There is supposed to have been a author in November.
One of the vehicles came off the street, pitched against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old accompanyer died.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, the internal minister Thomas Strobl considers that sharper penalties are not necessary: "The need for law enforcement of illegal motor vehicle races is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of Interior.

Nürnberg: Unauthorized Tuning-Treffen - Police attacks, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people participated in a "Tuning meeting" at the parking area of a furniture house.
The police implemented their notification to reinforce such events.

Illegales Tuning-Treffen in Nürnberg: Only a small part from the "Szene"
The officials were at the top about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police carrier.
However, it is only a small part of the presence of the "autoposers" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene came to the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it should be assumed that this was mainly a scientist.
In addition, the major share of the attendants in the existing infectious protection provisions, in particular the compliance of the minimum distance and the carrying of a mouth-nose protection.
The local control measures were completed at 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials in 10 vehicles found such constructive changes that the operating permit was excluded.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No author ends
Illegal authors did not.
"The Police Bureau will continue to observe the events and continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of scientists," said it.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the participating withdrawal company: "They have all beautiful fields that we can't devour," said Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are broader, the company needs to be careful not to hurt any damage.
"The young people are finally supposed to keep their cars back without any harm."
Numbers of the work agency: 900 suspects of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) is, according to its own statement, about 900 suspects of abuse in short-working money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short-work," said the Board of Directors for Operational Business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
As at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly had requested very many companies short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually, the test takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
The more precisely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot of things to do.
We are not naïve and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, BA uses analytical software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency threshold in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are distinct, but we are waving ourselves for the case and are now training our employees in the work agencies to edit applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconsistent, said Terzenbach.

"We all liked to do that in our youth," he said to the radio broadcaster Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched a information campaign to make young employees aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidays and locals were then tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak generates memories of the Austrian ski and party place Ischgl in Tirol, which was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe in the early phase of the pandemy.
In Austria, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United will return to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured the third table slot by a 2:0 (0:0) - success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to enjoy the Europe League because the FC Chelsea went by and also qualified as a fourth for the king class.
Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice in the fight against the decline.
Manchester United was led by a punishment of Bruno Fernandes (71th minute).
After a red map for Leicester City in the retirement time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) came to the end.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League-Achtlfinal Opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel to 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"This means very much to me," said Trainer Frank Lampard, who is also at the Final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea-Coach.
By Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Todtenham Hotspur also benefited from a magnificent 1:1 (1:0) by Crystal Palace and started as the sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided the Fernduell with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for themselves, however, had to shake at West Ham United for a long time for class support.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84.) was immediately similar to Andrej Jarmolenko (85.).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, who shot three trainers in the season, rises after five first-years.
Like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself through a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
One point was missing at the end.
The FC Liverpool, which has been established as an English master since the end of June, has secured a 3-1 (1:1)-winning Newcastle United’s record.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
The pointing record in the English football missed Coach Jürgen Klopp with his team.
The best mark holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle leadership in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) were turning the party on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torschütze van Dijk after the game, "this should encourage us to defend the title.
It's gonna be difficult."
The Premier-League Boss is expected to be satisfied at the end.
Due to the Corona virus crisis, the football company in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, even a premature breakdown or a release of the remaining games was discussed on neutral ground.
Finally, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without viewers in the stages.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanjahu
The protests in Israel against Head Netanjahus are increasingly exaggerated.
In the night there was violent controversy.
The Israeli police took a violent action on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against a demonstration against Benjamin Netanjahu, Head of the Legal Conservative Government.
Twelve people had been arrested because of disturbances, police speakers Micky Rosenfeld informed.
Among other things, the police used a water yard to dissolve the advertising.
According to media reports, about 6000 people had gathered near Netanjahus office on Saturday night.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters hit drums, bleached in horns, and called Netanjahu to withdraw.
If part of a counter-demonstration that supported Netanjahu had also been arrested, the news page "ynet" reported.
In many other places in Israel, people also demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the Head of Government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police statements near Tel Aviv because it is suspected that he had sprayed from a driving car pepper spray on demonstrations on the street edge.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrant had been easily injured at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there were last several demonstrations against Netanjahu.
The advertisements accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
Netanjahu was recently also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is pretended to be suddenly reluctant and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the economy of the country difficult.
The unemployment rate was at last over 20 per cent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel last increased to always new record values.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An ascension accident called for on Saturday afternoon at B58 at Ahlen nine light injured.
A car driver was on the way to Beckum with her two children (3.5).
The police: "Surely she had suddenly broken because she wanted to turn off."
That must have seen the driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her too late.
He forced behind on the car.
In the accident, three inmates were easily injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several rescue cars brought them to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea closes border town to Corona suspicion
North Korea has so far seen a "lightful success" in its own defence measures.
Now the country reports a suspicion for the first time.
Due to a first official Corona suspect in the country, North Korea has completely locked up a large city from fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been put into the country," reported the state media.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the emergency has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspect was confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the land shot.
North Korea has not registered any infection to date and described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms have been detected in the reports of a "sustainer" who, on 19 July, illegally crossed the military demarking line between South and North Korea.
The person had retired to South Korea three years ago and had now returned over the border.
In the first place, there was no confirmation from South Korea for the crossing of the four kilometres wide and most of the military buffer zones.
However, the South Korean military, according to reports by the National News Agency Yonhap, recognised the possibility of illegal crossing to North Korea as high.
There were investigations on some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, a urgent meeting was invited by the police office of the Labour Party, chaired by Power Holder Kim Jong Un, because of the suspect.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and devastating disaster."
Kim had already ordered as a preventive measure on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with them, were put under quarantines.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to examine the "outturn" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Excitement before the Council: City East and noise protection are still in front of a large summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental themes, the members of the bodies will also vote on the construction plan for the large project Innenstadt Development-Ost," it says rather occasionally in the middle part of the city press release to the next municipality meeting on Tuesday 28 July, at 16.30 p.m. in the large hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the revaluation of the Eastern City is discussed to the end.
The majority of them are hardly rejected, lastly in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estates, trade and IT), which was developed from the citizenship and then from administration and municipality, not to let now fail after nearly ten years of preparation, criticized the project opponent Reinhard Klein as "except parliamentary opposition", "unrecognised", "speculation", "suppression" and "conscious false statements".
"All think it's better to know," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipality for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizen List.
In fact, he was in this position in the lecture of the Treaties: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper for the city that the Technical Council House is contrary to the city administration's statements of subsidies, of which the existence of Klein is convinced to resettle for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than prognosising in the Council House and the supporters from the economy.
To design the city by its own power and not by an investor: this is its plan B. One day by little, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council House, the open-up of the Slotberg, the rental of the ex-tale for administrative areas and a smaller central city rehabilitation in ideal cases with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a key role
In addition, environmental issues will play a key role.
Thus, the municipality will vote on the noise action plan among other things.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheimer against health noise, caused by road traffic, including frequently temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, politicians in the city are not innocent of the need to do so because they have contributed to the massive increase in automobile and thus the noise, says the VCD.
Similarly, the municipality agrees on the participation of the city of the Pforzheim/Enzkreis energy and climate protection agency.
In addition, on the agenda of accession to the country of Baden-Württemberg climate protection pact, the re-determining of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the request for entry into the Smart City funding of the Federal Republic.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to follow Corona protection measures.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann started on July 31 in his premium season at ADAC GT Masters.
Before the Liga of Supersportwagens can take up the regular operation, the first test trips were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was especially about getting closer to his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premieres in the GT3 car.
"There are some things that are different from the porch from the pre-season," says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS, you have to go differently into the curves.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Roomman also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports cars in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience in the GT port, the Netherlands has been able to help his new team colleague in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand blendingly and we have made enormous progress on the Lausitzring also from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supersport cars will run through the Lausitz.
Roomman, who is one of 15 series new ones, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the motodrome.
"It worked fast and I had little to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen Renn Community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast a roommate is then really, that's going to happen in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the incidence of a tightly pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
Current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August on the Nürburgring, Ex-Formel-1-pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Transport Minister of Quarantine Decision Cold
The decision of the British Government to put Spanish travellers under quarantine for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, has been coldly taken by the transport minister of the country.
Thus Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London struck the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to return to quarantines after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
But the scheme applies to those who are only on the day of vacation, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, Spain is considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Talous ministers must have known in advance that there is the possibility of a quarantine being imposed for holidays in Spain," commented the Labour Delegated Diane Abbot.
"But obviously no one has made himself the effort to tell Grant Shapps."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit blocks, the numbers of infections in the country rise again.
Virologists are especially responsible for the new spread of the nightlife.
Spain is one of the most favorite vacation countries of the British.
From unnecessary travels to the Spanish mainland, the British Government is currently advising, the Canary Islands and Balearians that are particularly popular with British holidays are excluded.
To date, more than 272.000 infections have been registered in Spain with the new corona virus and more than 28.000 deaths.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin announces hypershell weapons for warships
The Russian President, Wladimir Putin, announced an equipment of warships with the most modern hypershell weapons on the day of the Marine in his country.
With these unique weapons in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian maritime forces would be expanded, said Putin on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central maritime parade.
The Defense Ministry also informed the Agency Interfax of successful tests of the circuit built for the marine.
The hypershell weapons show a multifold of the sound speed of approximately 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Subwater tropeo continues to be built
Also built on the atomic subwater topedo Poseido, it was called.
The sea drone is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The President, who also drove with a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be served in the individual fleet associations of the largest country of the earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country of the world.
For 300 years the Marine has been protecting Russia reliably, said Putin at the day celebrated by the sea.
Also, in many other Russian coastal places, the maritime forces began the day of the Marine with parades.
In Syria, where Russia fights along the side of Bazar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons view in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There ammunition was also fired.
Seeable in a video published by the Ministry of Defense were not only warships, including a sub-boat, but also fight hubs and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help due to Corona difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has been landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and violent rainfall were now threatened by parts of the US State, the National Hurrikan Center of the US Climate Authority NOAA informed in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called the emergency for numerous districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas makes the work of the helpers difficult, Abbott continued, according to the US media.
Evacuated for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
In view of the spinal storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is still worsened when one considers that it is featuring through a region that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona Pandemy.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes for caution.
You should not disregard practices that we've used to, such as carrying masks, said the governor according to the CBS transmitter.
It's important that everyone kept distance.
Hence, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, Corona was to be tested in emergency accommodations.
In the first place, damage had only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning revoked
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was found on the island of Padre Island directly outside the Texas coast on land, according to the authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been graduated to the orchid of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sagent, a warning had been issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a decline while "Hanna" continues to move into the inside of the country and to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurrikan "Douglas" was traveling to Hawaii in the night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the Hurrikan Center expected that it would continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, it is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane swell.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an over-average active orrikan season this year after a prediction from May.
From June to the end of November, up to ten orchids were expected, which could become up to six very strong spinal storms, the Authority had explained.
Averagely, there are six orchids over the Atlantic per year, three of them are growing into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which one under-mean even only 10 percent, was then called.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government observes the storms and is in contact with the states concerned.
Four gates: Video Assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were just two gates
Neapel - Four gates achieved, four gates are known: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naple in the Italian football-Liga series A, and was really mad at the video assistants of the Reference.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard against a crew," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
In the 8th minute, the host Neapel had led through a gate of external defense Elseid Hisaj, first in the 32th minute Filip Djuricic rejoiced the compensation.
The Video Assistant Reference (VAR) withdrawn the hit because of a absence position.
Five minutes later Djuric shot the ball again into the net - again the VAR interrupted.
Also the gates of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61th) took the arbitration team back after notice of the VAR.
In the time of replay, Allan made the 2:0 end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar fall on the street and punishes Sassuolo as no team before.
The new technology provides records," writes the Gazzetta dello sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard hurt
Munich (dpa) - Starting in the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double-winner FC Bayern with a relapse.
The Hansi Flick, who recovered after a short holiday and a few training days, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The French, who had the third most-party minutes of operation behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Head of Central Field Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to lack in decisive king-class duals.
In the Munich Schmuddel Wetter, the legal defendant broke off a training game and was driven from the place with a golf card.
How long the unlimited tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An effort in the eighthfinal back game against the FC Chelsea on 8 August is likely hard to be possible, which the 24-year-old final tournament, starting on August 12th of Lisbon, may hope.
The Bayers do not want to be stopped by the misfortune of training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formulation the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show its victorious track collectors in the 28 days to the end of the king class on August 23.
"We have just done the duties with mastership and pokal outstandingly.
Now it is true to create the special one," said Flick.
Until the councils can deal concretely with the final tournament and a training camp at the Algarve, however, the eight-final pole is at the FC Chelsea first.
After the 3:0 in the Hinspiel before the Corona break, the Londoners in the homeland arena should not be again a Bayern nightmare as in the lost "Final Dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the doors for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust tanks with a good game," demanded Flick.
A test to agree is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long talk, Flick had envoyed his stars, who had 13 days vacation after the double, to a unique August.
31 players he welcomed at the Sabener Straße, including the new stakeholders for noble shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the place after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has inserted himself well like all the new ones," said Flick.
However, instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. is not allowed to be trained anymore, Flick would rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After the days of single and small group training, the Londoners are now trained in team strength, which are in contrast with the Flick ensemble in the play rhythm.
Afterwards, the councils could face a quarterfinal against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final are real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
One way to the final in Lisbon "is not so simple," the Chief Coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday to Tuesday.
The WM recordor shooter Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is particularly relevant for the 0-to-100 consent.
With his current crew, work is "a pleasure", praised Flick.
The "focussity of profits" is an impressive movement of his team.
In the tournament with nine crews, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were involved, including the migrant Thiago and defendant David Alaba, whose remaining is not secured beyond the king class season.
The formula 1 needs a special rule to curb its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to provide the WM titles.
However, all American races were cancelled.
Running calendar becomes more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take form.
The Grand Prix, which has been confirmed to date, added three more race routes during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring is intended to be driven in Germany and in Portuguese Portimão.
On the first November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for WM points on the Italian race route in Imola.
This includes the 2020 race calendar according to current status 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress when we complete our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races are to be completed in this extraordinary season in the king class of motor sports.
Finishing the formula 1 wants its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the next few weeks.
Before the races already officially run in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports may still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
The Rules of Formula 1 requires for the award of the world championship, but at least races to three continents.
Although, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is to be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA wants to give the titles under appeal to "exceptional circumstances" due to the Corona virus pandemic.
The traditional seasonal start in Australia in March had to be suspended due to the corona crisis in the short term.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, this year the formula 1 will not be a guest in America.
Cancellation in Brazil takes criticism
Due to the excited Corona situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them again in the next season," explained Carey.
The absence of the American races was particularly criticism in Brazil: "The cancellation was not surprising for us, but the reasons we cannot accept," said Tamas Rohonyi, Promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the numbers of infections in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams, not wanting to drive in Brazil, would not justify the dismissal.
You should be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke of her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was visited in the famous lateight show by Stephen Colbert by video switch and told in the interview what she had in her head at her meeting with Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was visited by video switch in a popular US-Latenight show.
She shared her fight against the powers of the world, among other things.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - During the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg made attention to her intimate efforts to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known lateight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with the US president Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and conducted a longer interview with the Schwedin.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to distract the focus from the climate crisis," they shocked.
"All things from organised hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes on the street" she experienced.
Heads of government and leading politicians who are ridiculing against them in social media or who are even trying to silence them finds her "foolish" as you show the reactions, "as they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene where she was thrown a bitter-boss look after the US president Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the actvistin sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since then.
From the short clip a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which was finally one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did 17-year-olds think about the U.S. presidents at this moment?
She answered the question of Stephen Colbert, which was relatively openly, only briefly dry: "To be honest, I think that doesn't require any further explanation."
With the deliberate answer, the experienced satirist Colbert probably didn't expect and disappeared shortly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she remained in mind many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac Medfounder Peter Green died
His life was like a railway trip: After a fast rise with Fleetwood Mac it went steep down and then slowly back up.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members informed on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton valued Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the Band Fleetwood Mac.
The slaughterman Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-term legendary band in London in 1967 until today his dreamed instrumental heat "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") looked like a trail.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
It must have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for well-acting purposes.
He began to appear in wide garments and with great cruzifix.
Also, psychic problems are supposed to have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the image area.
He was supposed to have lived on the streets, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in a Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
He was enthusiastic for American blue musicians, such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was 11 years old, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and was given five years later the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Not long later he was engaged in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues tree, Green founded in the summer of 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers collar Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green, in the winter of 1968/69, gave the group the first number 1-hit and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not tolerate the media rush, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and abuse he later commented in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best was to land a number 1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 won a surprising success with a album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swims without him in new formation on a success wave.
The album "Rumours" published in 1977 selled more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo results, Green did not achieve a bigger comeback until he started with a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Free of drugs, Green published some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disappeared in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend in life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in recent decades.
