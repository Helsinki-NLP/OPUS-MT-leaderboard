AM in Wales is worried about "become as a puckon"
Some AM, Members of the National Assembly of Wale, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the House of Wales).
The proposal is planned to change the name of the National Assembly to the House of Wales.
MAN over the whole political spectrum is worried about being ridiculed.
A AM for Labour said his group was worried because "the rims with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who don't know Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
A AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waleser said that his group is "open" for the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is expressed in Walesian as the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, currently composing legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what members of the congregation are to be called is so clearly up to the members themselves."
The Government of the Act of Wales 2017 gave the Wallish Congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found a strong support for calling the House of Wales.
The Commission proposed Mr Welsh Parliament Members (Members of the House of Wales) or the WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
Am clearly suggests other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, which is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also includes other amendments to the functioning of the congregation, including rules for disqualification of an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM may vote on what they should be called when they are discussing legislation.
Macedonia shall carry out a referendum on the change of its name
On Sunday, the voters shall vote if they are to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is an attempt to end a debate that has been held for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said he will ignore the result.
But the followers of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's silence when the churches of Harlem face problems
"More people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on each corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"People are associating in other ways now," he said.
"Bars are no longer like the area's living room, where people go regularly."
He is worried that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as long as the leaders are expecting and that "formerly or later they will end up on the box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to closing all the churches, because those moving into the apartments will probably not be members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a bojkot of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or transmit black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, called the proud music game "the watchs of the poor."
The expert who played the watch game in July had another name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "a vital historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the larger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
The recent months' events at St. Martin's are a complex history of architects and entrepreneurs – some hired by the church's playmates, others of the episcopic foundation.
The church council – the congregation’s governing bodies consisting of physicians – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed an concern that the foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the church meeting, although the church meeting had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Hai hurts 13-year-old who dives after hummers in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy who ducked after hummers in California on the first day of the hummer season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had ducked with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hamel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a hummer, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bite!"
"I've been biten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that the whole key legs had been ripped.
"I cried to everyone to get out of the water." "It's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is indicated to be critical.
It's unclear what a shark it was.
The bathing captain Larry Giles told the mass media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's goes into the Great Britain Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes care of Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's with beauty-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a considerable push into the United Kingdom’s beauty market at £2,8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the quick purchase attempts to fill the shelves previously taken up by TV devices, microwave and household products.
Sainsbury's said they are going to double their beauty offer for up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with selected areas, such as in shops like Boots.
The shop chain also launches its boutique brand again so that most of the products are vegantic – as increasingly young customers require.
In addition, the parfymer salesman Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's shops – the first stand opened in Croydon in south London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local shops means that quick purchases must do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will look more and more like goods houses in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos status in hundreds of shops and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased the sale of food and made acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to provide the beauty and pharmaceutical departments with a facial lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boot's sales would be distributed in the quick purchases.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical activities with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial boss, said: "We have given our beauty courses a new appearance and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can give customers advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in smooth places, we are now a attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "awning" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal on £11 million
The Dragons Den Star Peter Jones is "awning" that the TV presentation Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not reach with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's mark Goop.
This morning presentation, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den-star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their lucrative lifemark for the last minute – to focus on his new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "rashed" at an exciting meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV Favorite admitted that her new agreement – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's mark Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left Truly at Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was clearly Holly's main priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked all those involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock of goods ready to be sold at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe that this Morning presentation decision to withdraw can cost the company several millions due to considerable investments in everything from cuts and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in launching.
And that may mean the end of a long friendship.
Three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
The couples vacate together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talk "and then we fell in love"
He was joking that the mass media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy a president" and that he was so positive about the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a news ancillary voice:
"I haven't given up."
He said that Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been established.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after the first step of North Korea's disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"Northern Korea's doing great," he said.
"We were about to war with North Korea.
Millions of people should have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim have had positive results – an end of rakets, liberated hostages, and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboks population had lost their homes, no exemption was granted, as required for international assistance.
"In many cases they have, unfortunately, been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicates everything," said Ms. Sumbung.
The rescued children gather a team to go to Palu, but it's still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the natural disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to decide whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the land is still sadly unprepared for nature’s anger.
It has been built tsunami protection in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastal lines.
The lack of a tsunami warning sire in Palu, despite the issue of a warning, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's tired infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railways.
But inadequate funding has plagued Mr. Jokos' administration for next year's elections.
Mr Joko is also pressed by persistent sectarist tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs struggled on the streets with machites, arrowbows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge recited in the last minute towards Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a target in the 89th minute in Stamford Bridge, London on Saturday.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the remote chair.
The attempt fled high over the target area to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hope and ended up in the net.
"I just tried to get into a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, and I didn't think so much about it, but just kicked."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a target in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker left a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick gi-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a supreme kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran from the defense and got the ball in the net at the remote chair with a left-foot kick by Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea is confronted with Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Death of tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the National Emergency Agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the waste of buildings that were racing in the earthquake of 7.5 that hit up to six metres on Friday and triggered waves, said the Agency's speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with rainy buildings.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed.
A murder investigation has been started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Criminal inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspected to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial for our investigation."
A lawyer of the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found in a real estate.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is on and the police will inform the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said nobody can enter or leave the building.
He became targetless when he found out what had happened.
The residents in the building have been informed that it takes several hours before they get back in.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared in the place.
She says "it's so terrible" again and again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another one just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestopper anonymously at 0800 555 111 and enter the log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of dispute on the rewriting of history
A banning light would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "dristy" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe Fel Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the 18th century's view of and is part of the history of a man that many believe still should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 18th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarch.
If this is a proper representation, it is subject to an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His businesses as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Killer Gris kills a farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a brushed artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder is ready to inject vaccine in pigs in a swine path on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig pad nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the swine with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The gris that killed the farmer wasn't belonging to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence in the place.
Yuan's family and those responsible for the market are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kilos stuck a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as a "katalysator".
"They're just playful.
They're nasting and very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the orcan Rosa for extensive rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the orcan Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler waters at the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is waiting to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trap begins to form over the Pacific Sea and travels eastward to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearing trap will create extensive rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5-10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, clay flows and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5-7,5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm rain is expected in some places in the southwest of the United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert to the foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make cannons to streaming rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
It seems that the nearby trap brings locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over one cm rain, which can lead to clay flows and hail roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rain period.
Some shiny tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may involve intense temperature changes in the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees of difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to have a warm start in October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the Northeast USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in the Eastern United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
Over 20 million looked at the Thursday's arresting witness from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that should have taken place in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
In the meantime, the political death situation continued and the normal transmission was cancelled for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI, where they got a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure that Kavanaugh tied on her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said that he's absolutely sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million given by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks showing the interrogation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has often problems counting people who look from offices.
Comparatively, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown a strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the long-term interrogation, according to Nielsen.
ABC had nearly the majority with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the interrogation.
Flake was in focus during Friday's drama.
After the republic's office issued an explanation that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS protesters crying at him when he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrants screamed at him, which was shown in direct sending by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the lift doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the Committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on if they were to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said he was only going to do that if the FBI was going to investigate the accusations against the nominated in the next week, which the minority democrats have demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake decided.
Flake's decisions had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump started a FBI investigation on the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" on the future of Britain and to undermine the interest of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the conservative party conference in Birmingham, UK 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal to collect the customs fees of the United Kingdom and the EU was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the site and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogation with Simpson, the police said he acknowledged he shot Wayde.
His assurance was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot in the head and in the neck.
Police thanks Louisiana State Police's refugee force, police lawyer, Southern University police and inhabitants in the area for help with the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flash and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meter long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
In Friday's morning, LSU's basketball trainer Will Wade said that the team was "crashed" and "shocked" by Waydes' death.
"You're worried about this all the time," said Wade.
Vulcan screams ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatépetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in Saturday Mexicans warned to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ash during the period of 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several molds and shells.
Images of social media showed thin layers of ash on winds in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano that is 72 km southeast of the capital since a earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police attacks with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the autonomy vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent protesters were struck with the criterion police at the same time as thousands of people participated in rivalising demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by screwallpolis threw eggs and colour powder on them, resulting in dark damn clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battle even broke out later during the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For hours, the independent groups cried "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists cried "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for less damage caused by the protests, according to local pressure.
The strain is still excited in the region, who longs for independence a year after the referendum on October 1st, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most of those who were opposed to the session bojkottad the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent crashes last year when the police tried to stop voting at election stations in the region.
Self-sufficiency groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration still took place, but it was forced to take another route.
Elektricist Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
"Tomorrow we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy in voting, but now we've been driving fast," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for their independence have had difficulties to maintain driving power this year, since many of their most well-known leaders live in self-declared exile or are in ceiling for a trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent independent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest to support the police on his mobile phone, said that the conflict had been fired by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he intends to candidate in elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Canting to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undercutting experience we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drives into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Criminal inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
A arm brushes may also have been fired against the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured profit
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not received a away profit in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers Rapid Vienna welcomes Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his profit range to six matches – the main trainer Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against twist visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they made goals; their straightforwardness caused Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but drew his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot board after gliding in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the target.
The home team satisfied to let Rangers play in front of them, when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was achieved.
Rangers gave up a frispark and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made targets from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was indispensable and the target guard Liam Kelly was mainly left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot board from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were rejected.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal display and results for Livingston.
Every one was outstanding and continues to exceed the expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the whole line straight through.
But Rangers missed inspiration.
They've had their moments during Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't hold it – they only opened the home page once – and it's one of a wake clock for Rangers, which is in the middle.
The Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited on smiles and blue skys (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany for breakfast together in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between the NATO allies.
They have become disadvantaged over human rights, freedom of printing and Turkey's entry into the EU.
The Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dual protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as a unanimous ruler of violence by others.
Road luck in Deptford: Cyclist dies in crack with car
A cyclist died in a crack with a car in London.
The Krocken took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-coursed road in Deptford, southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died in the place.
The crack takes place a few months after another cyclist died in a infectious accident at Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crack in Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they're trying to identify the man and inform his closest relative.
Roads have been locked off and buses have been redirected and car drivers are requested to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Sex guards damaged in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in an alarm at a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The disturbances broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and still on.
Specialized "tornadovacts" have been called there to deal with the disturbances, which involve eight prisoners on a flyer.
The guards were treated in place for smaller injuries in the face.
A speaker for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff has been sent there to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those who are behind this will be linked to the police and may be given increased prison penalty."
HMP Long Lartin runs over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the prosecution police was called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where staff were attacked with billions of balls.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas of drought can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but it is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remaining energy of the orkaan Rosa moves over the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into the south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a twot that only "10 tropical cyclones have maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km from Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest of the United States, including central Climbing Mountains and Great Basin, probably get 2.5-5 cm rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by dryness.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably benefit because southwestern America suffers from dryness.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffer from at least extreme dryness, the second highest category, reported weather.com.
Orcan Rosa will first travel over Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane force in Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Sea, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to now be the land mass of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may have heavy rain, which constitutes a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7,5-15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into south Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger of Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert in southwestern America," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to sudden floods and clay flows in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenager boys and a 20-year-old man have been suspected for murder attempts after a 16-year-old found with knife in Somerset.
The teenage boy found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking everyone who can have filed what happened to the mobile to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, evil, anger" from the democratic party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the disrespectlessness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to his followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "of evilness, anger" from the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the convention in Thursday and strongly denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he was sexually committed to her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation before the convention.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of our time's most skilled legal minds, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of republics voting in the next midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices of our life.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm a candidate," he said.
That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates.
Trump claimed that the democrats are trying to "stand against and stop."
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from a assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu in Friday when up to six meters of high waves crashed against the beach in the sky and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamin came after a earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victims of tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia's disaster agency GBPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamine was not alone but was dragged with cars, stocks and houses. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunami had traveled on open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to escape tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 buildings in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapseed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftercry still hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was known in a region with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake in Friday was 200 times the size of the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunami larger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have crashed.
Dead victims found during the boat of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were damaged and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquake.
The communication from Donggala "was completely lame without any information," said Nugroho.
"It lives over 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday because it had not informed that tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities stated that the waves had appeared in the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video divided on social media, a man at the top of a building is crying frenetic warnings about tsunamine to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamima led to a widespread power interruption that interrupted all communication around Palu, which severed the rescue work for the authorities.
The military has started sending your cargo flight with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need for food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for the assistance work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of dead in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Workers from the World Vision in Donggala have gone to Palu where they are looking for protection in the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the bitter assistance work, but some complained that foreign assistance workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign staff may only be used if exemption permits are issued after a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say that it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not yet been revealed."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, family and friends of missing people were still hoped that their close and loved ones would prove to be the miracles that light up dark natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was saved from a wash.
Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who had been stuck for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesian national screen flight trainer, had trained two of the missing screen flights before Asian games, which had ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others that were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the screen flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me the hours after the screen flights heard that Roa Roa Hotel had crashed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages got only a gray bock, instead of two blue.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26 750 under bankroom filling at Newport on the Levee
In Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a Brink's staff who filled on a bankroom at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car driver had emptyed a bankroom in the entertainment plant and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, another man jumped up behind the Brink's staff and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
The Witnesses saw several suspected flights from the site, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information about the identity of the offenders shall contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper switches name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The creature that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which sets up for "sensitive reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It went from Kanye, which means "the only" to just Ye – a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a series of famous rapers who've changed their names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously cooperated with West, has previously written its name with and without binding lines and uppercase.
The AMLO of Mexico swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation to students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Tlatelco Plaza in Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, and killed up to 600 people during a time when left-oriented student movements hit root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sweared to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of training possibilities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI financing
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and the AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. Government have made statements on AI, despite the fact that the United States does not have a general formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the aim of becoming leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for next breakthrough within the AI," said Lee.
A double as large budget can double the chance of the next major AI break in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the highest ranched American Othello player, and later he was in the leadership of Microsoft Research and was director of the Google China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to receive funds from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funds to academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other authority organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the creation of the Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the change of name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum if the country's name is to be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would resolve a decades old debate with Greece which has prevented the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a bojkot campaign has led to doubts about the minimum participation of 50 percent required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The question of the counterpart in the referendum is: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the followers of the reputation, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth renaming if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries that were formed when Yugoslavia was divided, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because that means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they are going to follow the result to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last Parliament election 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children's sake, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dushko, voted in the referendum in Macedonia on the change of name, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents that have been set up by the Bojkots the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head in the air, not swing through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of a European Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO would lead to well-required investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment of over 20 per cent.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, for over 80 percent of our inhabitants are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "recognition of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Survey, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them thought to vote yes.
In order to count the referendum, 50 percent of registered voters must be plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious resignation for the Western-based government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes all the Brighton defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling hit Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's profit at 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously simple when he made targets for the 65th minute.
The Argentine Stricer got a passport from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out to the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around a defense and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling on the left.
The English forward used its first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, which used the right foot to beat Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made targets at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial overtake in the Premier League fight.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's area on that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few kicks and led Sterling to the remote chair.
Sky Blues forward sparked the ball into the net the moment before it ended out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals has been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But Scherzer will throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the final game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a profit of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but is still looking for its first division title.
"We play about nothing, but we can get a chance to knock rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals has not yet announced its start for Sunday, but, according to reports, they are opposed to allow Scherzer to throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullet in Thursday and would throw on its normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed caster is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 inside this season.
Trump holds speech in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, which is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of republics to vote in the next midterm elections.
"All that we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of the most important choices of our life.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not candidate, but I'm candidate. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happen here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever it requires, you see their evilness, terribleness.
They don't care who they need to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control.
Democracies, he said, fighting to "stand against and stop."
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said and called the Democrats "awful and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was encouraged by high bowl from the audiences.
"Do you remember what she said?
"Did you get the document?"
'Eh, eh, eh, eh?
No, no, no, I expect a ...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When momentum activists in my local party voted for censurering me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last one in a series of MPs from Labour who will hear we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Mr Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was opposed to anti-semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar to the subjects for which Jeremy criticized previous leaders.
The Communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not that, and the promise of "friendlyer, merciful" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged from the fact that the leaders of the party accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view as I expected I would make a whole turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed – whether the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
Every time I speak publicly – and that doesn't really matter what I say – follows a tired of unawareness on social media that requires me to be disposed, criticizes middle policy and says that I should not even be in Labour.
And this isn't just me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are mostly addressed to me are political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they are faced with a stream of sexist and racist injuries every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era's policy is the level of injury which is now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with any disbelievers and changes in the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly tighter.
I've been given many advice in the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight forward, so "it's going to be."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Since I joined Labour as a schooler 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher's government's negligence, which literally caused my primary school classroom to fall together, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need the most – both at local level and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused by my views on policy and topics where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the claim on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, activities and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my elections – both Labour members and others: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no threat to disposal or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Olympic Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
They're now at the top, the only unblowed side of the ten.
Finally, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave homemade profit, and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unblowed, so we are so obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the leadership but a yellow card for Scotland Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a punishment, and at the end of the first half he made points and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the pause.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half game and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long waiting for a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the leadership again with a trial from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose once again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to handle Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penal line out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt.
Still Game Star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been specified as CEO for a licensed restaurant activity.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-standing comedi partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the next nineth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry".
"The port belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Sea again
Seafarers patrol a rigged headquarters for the La Paz fleet.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The bases of the fleet from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazona wear the motto: "The harbour belongs to us.
It's our duty to recover it."
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastal line lost to Chile is still strong in a bloody resource conflict in the 18th century – and it is also the longing to sail again on the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than for decades now when Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court on 1 October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will judge in favour of Bolivia's demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to take their own exit to the sea.
Monday's decision also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president who is faced with a controversial fight for revaluation next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Sea," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analytists believe that it is incredible that the Court judges the benefit of Bolivia, and that not much would be changed even if it does.
The United Nations Court, based in the Netherlands, has no right to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a chilenian expert on international law.
And the last four years may have been hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has tears of Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not consider the decision of the Court of Justice to be taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "a outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop for 139 years of differences with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the matter of the sea as a political crochet.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific Sea," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we have to go on from the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not devastate its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the two rivalising leaders.
His comments came when U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seem to be on the border to solve the death situation for nuclear diplomat more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "wish dream" of continuing sanctions and American protests against an explanation of the end of the Korean war will ever tighten North Korea.
Washington hesitates to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first launches significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want one more summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against that Pyongyang really wants to get rid of a arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line huge headbonads on the way to stores close to you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of disgusting, over-dimensional headbonads for their SS19 collection on the catwalken, which bleached the style icons at the Paris fashion week.
Unbelievable incredible hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their insightful creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an excessive beige hat with a fermentlike broad hat board that completely took over the model heads.
Other over-dimensional accessories included jewel-proofed water melons, a magic carrot and even ananas – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips and compared Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation looked like a wet suit with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass rod.
And if you continue the huge courage, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge hills can be on the way to stores close to you.
The over-dimensional hats come right after La Bomba – the halm hat with a 60 cm fragrance that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the incredibly incredibly incredible hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk — a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the model of bathing suite that contained it.
The rape bag in terracotta, with raw fibres and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
Knowledge styleist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer – the designer has had such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessories."
John Edward: Language skills decisive for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other social entities.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement adapted teaching plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanded topics at schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when we create relations and confidence with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the list, with the maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students who studied Mandarine received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as decisive skills that children and young people no doubt will need in the future.
Languages such as topic choices are now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on teaching plans in independent schools and beyond.
A study carried out by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills 2014 concluded that employers had for various reasons difficulties in filling their vacation services, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of skills in languages.
With this said, language skills become more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increasing future jobs demanding language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Can communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a study of more than 4,000 adult British published by YouGov 2013, 75 percent answered that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totally came up in a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Talking several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important to Britain by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scotian independent schools strive to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills required to succeed, regardless of what the future has.
In a global economic environment, languages are undoubtedly still crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capabilities".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for the young people of Scotland.
I want the bees to be fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over to fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell Tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for Lakers' seasonal schedule.
"I don't need a seasonal game in this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is doing his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five planned events in the next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In waiting for a confirmatory vote of its candidate for the vacancy of the High Court, Trump aims to build up support for future interim elections, since the Republics risk to lose control of the Congress before the present election in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is planned for 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearing by the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited for accusations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate of up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans to get some meat on the legs before the November selection.
Thus President Trump said that these five conventions next week aim to "engage volunteers and followers when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and Representative House", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman of the Trump campaign which would not be named to Reuters.
The night's events, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time in the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has struck after in the opinion surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in the opinion surveys," says Simon Haeder, a state knower at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep the hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three unilateral sessions, the pair races in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment's turning pendel is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what momentum is it now about?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we wear it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has, of course, the advantage of four points in advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and is a good example.
The wine trop scaled more than higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive put to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had slept after with two after two games.
His put that won them the match of 15 was met with a similar wrath, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more scores than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's unquestionable story.
Europe's outstanding but delightful couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bookey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the responses of the audience indicate that they are the players to hit on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process map with Sergio Garcia, the morning fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two doubles on front nine, the Spanish and the Swedish lowered in a hole that they never even came near to crawl out.
However, on Sunday there is no one who will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team to date and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the Team USA has a fighting joy that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the leadership with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after coming out of Saturday's fireball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 leadership across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, who struggled to keep the pokal that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago dominated an American law that never really started during the morning fireball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, only the second couple is to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they hit an exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphasized 5 & 4.
Woods, who struck through two matches on Saturday, showed tests in a few hours of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning fireball and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - ranged one and three in the world.
Europe did not have the wind all the way, but it was a nice, blowing day immediately southwest of Paris.
Three-fold winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home the victory with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fireball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history, a team has returned from a four-point underground in the single matches, but Furyk's page needs only one undefinite result to keep the pokal.
After being the next best for two days, it seems to be a contradictory attack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says they will "never" unilaterally untrusted arms
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust against the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that in the last year, North Korea had taken "a significant action to show its willingness", for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, demonstrating the installations of nuclear tests and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any corresponding answer from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will be unilaterally armed off ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance against an approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would result in the reward of North Korea as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution just as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean leader in Singapore 12 June, where Kim promised to work against the "development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first remove its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations on the ease of harsh international penalties against North Korea.
"USA insists on "deviation first" and increases the pressure by penalties to achieve its purpose through force and even opposes the "declaration of the end of the war", says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can get us on our knees is a wish dream for the people who do not know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leaders highlighted earlier in the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party in this issue of nuclear arms was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come into such a death situation."
Yet, the tone in Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the future ability of North Korea to reach the United States' mainland with missiles was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "raketman" at a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take measures for disarmament, but it said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is being disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months," doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue with force and without fail until we implement a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to kväve the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn't good.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of setting "gangster-like requirements".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to demonstrate a missile plant and also a nuclear crab complex if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "consistent measures" he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and moving against normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctors to improve their sleeping habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dycks".
A academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often insane about the foundations for caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his stroke in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep deficiency on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and atletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep shortage during the week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactive data.
In part of the course, there is a picture of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coachers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how atletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency and the weight of good sleeping habits.
In some other parties, participants will learn how long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the student's behavior directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of "sustainable" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on the students meant that sleep deficiency was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight rise because sleeplessness puts the brain in famine and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus cross-border course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctors to complete a similar study program before they start their studies at the high performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider to set an alarm for when to lie down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the day, which leads to insomation problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas targets lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's unequal side to a 1-0 lower team in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for taking home its first victory on the way since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be more problems on the hill for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after a object was thrown from the remote end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-killing games overlooked the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes into the game when Mengas first passport released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middlefielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A free park on the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow just reached the back chair.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo must have felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the colombian's call.
Rangers managed only to do two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly easily accepted Lassana Coulibalys nick and a tam spark from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis opening shots for the 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their serving deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's firm situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher suited Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the pause when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the prey gave almost immediate effect when the surface hit the ball into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the contradictors to play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long passport after long passing.
Holt's side could have strengthened its direction during the last stage, but McGregor was well able to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nicked outside after the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he was tamped with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanack: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicle called Geigermeasurer.
Geigermeasurers have become a foundation for science since then and also figures great in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN "What in all the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these hearers, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms issued by the radioactiveness of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hes" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that wears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defence to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defence to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine learns the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then is re-injected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different forms of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, learning to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes growth of several types of cancer, including breast-, egg-stock, lung and thick-heart cancer, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Canye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA sheep, after its SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was builded out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swimming appearance where he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he himself would candidate for the post in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he had a Make America Great sheep, he railed against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"As many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s witness to the Senate’s Legal Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the playback of West's interpretation was uploaded to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his main house.
"They mobbed me backstairs.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They mobbed me!
And then they say I've fallen low," he said, according to Washington Examinator.
West continued: "Will you also sink low?" and said he would "set my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try with love."
His comments at least two times attracted more burops from the audience and employees from the SNL seemed to be ashamed, reports Variety. One person said, "It was deadly stuck in the studio."
West had come in as a later substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confused many with their appearance of the song I Love it, dressed out for a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who Tweeted: "To one of the most courageous souls: Thank you for standing on you with MOBBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, Tweeted that West was simply "self and it's completely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "kunst") that I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we are, she added.
Before the show, the rappar on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rappar colleague, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music leader Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
They for murder attempts after knife cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of murder attempts after a man knife in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The accusations will be examined by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington strikes against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his swordswearing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen often means that young boys feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believes that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow actress in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, acknowledged that he feels "gwise strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we educated men with regard to the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV can be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine character.
He continued, "What is native and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and streets, making young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that is really one of the big questions today - how do we change it?
It's obvious that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones follower when the series comes to an end next summer and says he's "free with battlefields and horses."
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's character Jon Snow loves, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies family owners in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has notified an increase of 14% of the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says the health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV in this way had decreased to almost zero, said Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV-infected through collection is an emergency issue in China's HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination of HBT persons is said to be widespread.
Due to its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men before or later will marry women.
Many of the infectious cases are due to inadequate protection when collecting in these relations.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of the efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that personnel lecture the GOP Senator's tasks, covering "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories"
The U.S. Congress member Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday claims that one of her employees had placed personal data on three Republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were distributed by right-extremistic websites.
"A lie, lies and more rejective lies," said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The released information included home addresses and phone numbers to Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information arrived online Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of a Senate Panel on the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifys the source of the posts was associated with Waterer's office and released the information about a member of Waterer's staff, reported Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"My personnel - whose identity, personal data and security have been jeopardized by these deceitful and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly received criticism online, including from the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They can't be proud.
They must not question the motive of the questioner.
They must be calm and sensible."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the democratic criticism of judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was candidate for deploying Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Sorry about true," he Tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal beings against these deceitful requirements.
"We will ensure that the actors will be revealed," she continued, "and they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parodi by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit services in every new film with British luring, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodies that were fired in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will wet satir about how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, it has received the incompetent Johnny English with the gummian view its license to renew the business for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
He is of course the crazy secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a gnutta Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two fine moments in the latest JE movie
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor leaves hit his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedi is shown, but the humor feels rather low and strangely overwhelming, especially because the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offer comedi as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's adapted for children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumbled brass in the role of Bean.
The constantly current subject is now that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrate Britain's super secret network of spys, which reveals the identity of all British agents out in field, to the agent in the service's great dissatisfaction - a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last strain of a Prime Minister who is a pumpous and hard-employed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of its political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the manus doesn't offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the producing Johnny English in its own high person, now employed as a teacher of any well-made institution, but offering inofficial lessons in art to work undercover next to it.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an acute meeting and reunited with its previous long-standing sidekick Bough, once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine, a jolly-hockey-sticks roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to waste.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terrible wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service and meets Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, which claims that he can solve Britain's computer fraud: the unhappy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssé of pharmaceutical excitement: dressed for servitors, they put fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle themselves on the Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR heads to get acquainted with the inside of Volta's house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but even though the film is both charming and speedy, it has a air of child TV around it.
It's kind of moderate.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I can't stop thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies a plan for the British to work for a four-day week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour considers a radical plan that means that the British work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The Party, as it is said, wants business leaders to transfer savings made by the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra free day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but keep the same wage.
According to sources, the idea "pass" with the party's economic agenda for the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A representative higher up in Labor said to The Sunday Times: a review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that suits the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, including the party The Greens who promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not recorded by Labour as a whole.
A speaker of Labour said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there is nothing that the party agrees about."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate their vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "intelligent leaders" and "snipper" on state companies.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot get back all their efforts, since a Labour government can do "deduction" due to what they perceive have been wrong actions.
He also confirmed the plans to set workers in corporate governances and to create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then stands to receive annual shares of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinions
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the High Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could cause some republic senators to change the position of the matter.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the republic senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead to their change in opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, unambiguous."
However, Graham's voice seems inevitable.
"I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be worth the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a huge impressive set of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission; combating world poverty.
During its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people traveling to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international professory group who hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, ring or in other meaningful ways contribute to increasing awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been with 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clicktivism" - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its followers who struggled for a variety of objectives.
It says that these actions have contributed to stimulating world leaders to announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than $37 billion, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in Britain between investors and stakeholders involved in "helping children to develop to their full potential", promiseing to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to combat subnutrition in the area after having received more than 4.700 Tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just as you, we can make social injustice that undernutrition is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the Tracey Ullman partnership to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken which require Britain to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs aimed at 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the usual questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered the Global Citizen: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-partity movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at the year's events in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports, declaring the Minister of Homeland
The government can, if necessary, intervene in its fleet to prevent Russian energy players from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed the U.S. Home Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examinator.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it seems to be the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him there are ways and means to handle it.
"USA has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to deal with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are truly the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day country" with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
Countries will, after the Trump administration has had a goal of increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
For this purpose, the Trump administration officials, including the US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "catch of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington’s opposition to the project is only driven for economic reasons and is an example of disloyal competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Minister for Energy Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly disapprove that a third party disturbs our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she's going to set up in the presidential election of 2020," says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thought" about her participation in the presidential election after the United States' mid-year elections.
During a Council House meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider putting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, "The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll take a lot more thought about candidateing to the presidential post."
Warren was weighing into President Donald Trump during the Council House meeting and said he "take this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been profound in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's followers did not believe that she would be candidate for 2020.
Fifty-aight percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not candidate, according to an investigation carried out by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% for a potential candidate and 48% against.
Other high-profiled democratic names discussed with regard to potential 2020 candidates include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking a job in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday evening.
"What my own son goes through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest for "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence in the home to a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and arms in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as the District of Columbia, support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton States and District of Columbia support a legal trial directed against a new American policy that denies asylum to victims flying gang-related violence or violence in their homes.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the crowns in the case of Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gangster sons" abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems of gangs and violence in their homes.
The new US asylum policy changed a decision by the immigration authorities from 2014 which enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances applicable to the requirement, and such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further argued in the report that the policy that denies immigrants' entry damages the American economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labour force".
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who escaped violence in home and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all the problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death number is doubled in the hunting of survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked darker.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted his female boy in a evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a defect."
The inhabitants were seen return to their destroyed homes, rotating through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured in the earthquake of 7.5, were excessive.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of still strong aftercalls.
With tearful eyes he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the hotel's fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't escape.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press and added that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda advertising"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided ad in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador of China accused Peking to use the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement in Des Moines Registry - State Iowas's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the United States' 6th Congress elections, something that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere with US elections marked what American officials told Reuters every is a new phase in a escalating campaign from Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's remuneration rates were designed early during the trade war to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "doubling the mob by putting propaganda ads into our own free pressure."
"China's government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free pressure to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertising in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper skis on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of deviating voices and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's worried economy, since media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, "he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, even though he didn't say what newspaper.
Republicans scare away female choosers in the mid-year choice by Kavanaugh-fiaskot, warns analytics
Since many top-republics defend the nominated Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court, which faces several accusations of sexual abuse, analytics have been warned that there will be a relapse, especially from women, during the next election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most republics have already shown where they are in the elections.
It is not possible to turn the clock back, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to a FBI investigation will be enough to calm up angry chooser.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, they scanned the demonstration "November comes!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans who control the court committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go into the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analytist, to the news site.
"The people say it was already high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the still indefinite female choosers in the suburbs and younger electors, 18 to 29 years old, who, despite their disagreement with the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public witnesses with accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analytists suggested that a relapse could be followed if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused touch for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the Committee's vote or final vote or Kavanaugh's coming through, it's also about how republics have handled this and how they have treated her," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities, a group that assists democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided by who they should believe in the refrigerators of Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford’s witness, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying under their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as they were reported by at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford witnessed before the Senate court committee during an oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her violently at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his gender bodies to her while they attended a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technologyist, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons are accessed to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the intention behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can get access to which type of information.
The company calls it personal authorization through data.
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the high side over one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has in recent months been an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic for this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Viktoria crosses celebrated during World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded with a Victoria cross during World War I is now celebrated in his home city 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for her action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a bullet four days later and never learned that he had been assigned the most prestigious price of the British military.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brillically symbolic," that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann on September 29, 1918 led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick dim and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
Later he rushed up to the shot line and led the "great brave" line forward before he solely decided the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German bullshit on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "some thing I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble before."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put down a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "professed himself very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a real hero's opposition is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you've stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the headcard and was displayed live in the night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after keeping awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed child program as "a sick joke."
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they were forced to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice-in-law for marketing and communication when he was asked for the transmission.
Greta pig, yes.
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their planning to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution to the reward," said Coker.
"But there's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the exchange of programs disturbed many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it was actually a state question.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our striving to satisfy fans.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt less than his companions during his grown up because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop".
He also said that he cared less about winning the OS after becoming a parent.
The popular show's ordinary program manager, Kirsty Young, has taken off a few months because of disease.
During his one-time performance at the first Laverne program, Daley tells him how he felt "less worthy" than others during his grown up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy and feeling me different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "some," he said, so he didn't betray everyone when they eventually found out his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic Bronze Mediator has become a highly profiled professor of HBT rights and has exploited its appearance at the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to convince more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live open without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The threefold world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone in the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all life perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son is carrying the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him: you're not gonna be able to sit on the front line Dad," he said.
"I kept his hand when he quit breathing and it wasn't until he had actually quit breathing and he was dead as I finally acknowledged that he was not incapacity," he said.
The next year, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to diving in front of a home public in an Olympic Arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him to the OS and still gave him shocks.

Mickelson from the form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the shape to avoid a unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting heyaklack and training on his gambling in the hope of a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the straightest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough banana at Le Golf National, where the long reputation often fails hard.
It's not only the banana that's terrifying, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson's master Francesco Molinari, who together with the nove Tommy Fleetwood won all the four matches this week.
If the Americans, which are 4 points below the 12 single matches, have contemporary wind at first, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a clap on my back and laid his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He's self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a famous man, and he has brought so much to these laws during previous seasons and during the past week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd be able to do more, but now it's what it is and we'll have to satisfy it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never completely lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said that his presence brought other quality teams.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, chick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players thought it was fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory just
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows of experience that a significant leadership in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly change into a unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game on Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but that finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"There is a reminder that we led great in Valderrama, we led great on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with emergency and nap," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leading with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point of the table.
Our goal is to try to win this pocal and that is where our focus lies.
I've said it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bear was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never cope with this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges are awaiting.
Tomorrow, it is the individual performance that applies and it is a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's okay, but when you're out on your own, your capacity is fully tested as a golf player.
It is the message you need to communicate to the players, to get the best out of itself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exception Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great conversions during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he stopped as losers when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said as an answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to go out as fast as on Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace gets started on one hand, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it was enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
Germany’s new warship is resigned
The latest fregatt of the German fleet would have been seen in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be seaed until at least next year due to wrong systems and high costs, reported local media.
The execution of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leadershipship for the entire new Baden-Wuerttemberg vacations, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit Zeitung, quoting a military speaker.
The vessel should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems arising after delivery were fatal for the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen ships.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air- and maritime missiles, as well as some moisture techniques, such as reduced radars, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest fregates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the banbreaking warships - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already obsolete when they are in operation, says Die Zeit.
The destiny F125 freight created headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons for the returation, but German media stated a number of important "safety and hardware errors" which made the warship worthless if it was used on a combat mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregates in the Bremen class.
It also found that the ship has a significant overweight, which leads to reduced performance and limits the maritime capacity to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the whole project’s price bar - including training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to be EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start of the period.
Problems affecting the latest fregates become particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is decreasing.
Previously this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the fleet actually "starts getting a shortage of fully equipped ships".
The official said that this is a growing problem, since old ships are dissolved but no substitute ships have been provided.
He regretted that none of the fregattes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Thievelights to the Secret Life of the Fledermouse
New research carried out on a property in the Scotland High Countries aims to reveal how flatter mouse uses the landscape in its hunting for food.
We hope that the results will throw new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and contribute to the management of future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow South and Dwarg Pistrell as well as brown loans and Daubenton flattermuse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important places around the property to track flatter mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of fladder Mouse sound and which species do what.
A life environment map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Care Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of life that are most important to the flatter mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will contribute to determining the benefits of life environment management work such as the creation of angels and the best way to maintain forest fields for flatter mice and other related species.
Fleder Muse Populations in Scotland and Britain have significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects bone and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as hue tax attacks.
In fact, flatter mice is not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the change.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flatter mice seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, examine bon and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated flatter mouse reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland's ten fladdermus species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here on Threave we have a good area for flatter mouse," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veterinary trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is a lot of fladder mice that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He emphasizes the importance of searching for flatter mice before carrying out maintenance in real estates, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly destroy a whole population.
Fledermouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, torment, torment, or to destroy their bones.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our flatter mice and too many of our species we don't know how their population feels."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to vote the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the accusations of rape against him for "false news" and says people "will market" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote in the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raped a American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a Live video at Instagram Ronaldo (33) broke down the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the reporting of the requirements.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote Der Spiegel over claims, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspects of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed event was held in June 2009 in a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the claimed event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a reconciliation because she felt "red of retaliation" and was worried about "becoming humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to repeal the reconciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the claimed event.
Ronaldo was on the way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the claimed assault, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will be forever repentant" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if one lost his status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, has said Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "annoying" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they will temporarily quit production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a stop of production in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with what car manufacturers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is driven on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37: minute from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it could lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of consumption in stock in its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thereby the production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid controls at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, allows not only success at present to be appreciated now, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to the BBC Radio 4: program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely have to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be "shielded in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special advisor Robert Mueller, who examines Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus jeopardise Mueller's independence, has given fuel to Washington's quarries for months.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying an audience equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of disposing the President through the 25th addition of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his departure appeared.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee's interrogation where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual inconsistency, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of accusations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been established, it may happen this week, or a lateration with a week in view of all other things that happen at the highest court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The values of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disadvantaged TV reporters that "play for the gallery," even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questionnaires than any President before him," she said and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the U.S. President, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and press conferences will be replaced, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances to the gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of discontinued status applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector of the country.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the expiry continue to take decisions that are expected to come in the autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each colleague, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing acute surgery after he has been affected by head damage
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christion Abercrombie undergone an acute surgery after suffering from a major injury in the loss of Saturday with 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee States chief trainer Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapseed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie acid on the sideline before he was placed on a bear was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/scope of damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five pairs on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a seasonal total of 18 pairs.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless, according to the new plans of the Tory Party
The action shall neutralise Corbyn's success with attraction to young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The UK Financial Ministry expects to get up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers shall be allowed to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The extra money shall be used to help homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's successes in attraction to young electors with promises of housing at more affordable prices and to aim into high income.
The increase in the stamp tax will be taken out of individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. Extra money will give a ride to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in recreational housing and housing purchased for rent. It may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will increase up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 per cent of the newly built property in London is purchased by people living outside the UK. This raises prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot into the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play will only be a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large building companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and called on Theresa May to refrain from quotas in housing with affordable prices to resolve Britain's "depressive housing situation".
Jeremy Corbyn has launched an outstanding range of proposals for housing reforms, including rentals and an end of wages without the debt of the tenant.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new housing.
Theresa May says: "I said last year that I would spend my time as Prime Minister in restoring the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems of the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build up a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and also for companies based on abroad, to buy housing as too hard-working inhabitants in our country.
The dream of owning its dwelling has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an insignificant fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's trainer.
The 42-year-old Scottish looks forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeast England, which is currently on the third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-land team and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always locked me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage a club."
Among the representatives of Ros as a trainer for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about following such established names in such a large club. He has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Only now, I consider success on the basis of the answer to the question 'can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club belongs absolutely to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, after a period as a assistant trainer in Dumbarton and a 15-month show as a member of Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from descendation to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close down to be winner of the championship title of the season afterwards.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he recalls and refers to when he took over Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
That sounds weird, because I had good results and could live well on it, and I also had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There's a lot to get through every week.
There's still stress and pressure on the job for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done throughout my adult life."
Listen to the whole interview in Sportsound, Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00
A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer’s heat wave has resulted in increased revenues for the country’s fighting pubs, but the restaurant chains have had greater pressure.
Numbers showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant income decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin from the Corporate Advisory Company CGA, who has compiled the numbers, said: "Continue beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World World Trade Agency longer than expected meant that we had a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs increased by 2.8%. However, the restaurants had even more difficulties.
The reduction in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars offering above all drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than restaurants had gone down.
Puberts offering food were also difficult in the beautiful weather, even if it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The draft for managed pubs and bars increased the drink sales by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman at the service and entertainment industry RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports events are still the most important factors in the sale on the wholesale market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% every year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come more inappropriate to companies driven by food sales. The time may show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give some well-needed respit."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now launched.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub bar and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes information on how it goes for 47 active groups with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, and is a established target in the industry.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One study shows that one in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study among 20,000 students at high school and high school shows an increase in the number of false Instagram pages
The result has increased anxiety that sexual content is placed there
20% of the students reported that they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years old, create accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study among 20,000 students at the high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instakontos", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has been late to worry that sexual content is posted there.
20% of the students stated that they have a cleaned "main account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who snubbled over her 13-year-old daughter's secret side found a teenager who urged others to "rape me."
According to the study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmissresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The Chairman of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the idrotters" in the Board of the Scottish Free Sports Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the Board of Directors of Scottish Atletics as an external governing member of the Governing Body's Annual Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most praised free sports rat, and President Ian Beattie describes the choice as an outstanding opportunity for those leading sports to benefit from her wide experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect in the entire Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four olympic gold and is now a expert commentator at BBC. He lost the ability to walk after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time had to show whether I would recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with core parts of the Internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused differences on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to choirs that are milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first quiet breast pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video inspired advertising film with humoristic appropriations to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump gives mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a high-filled cage with cows to a song with text lines like, "Yes, I milk myself, but have no tail" and "If you didn't know it, this is no jury, but tits."
The refraction continues: "Pumpe out, pump out, pump out, I feed the babys, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused fights on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light on the dairy industry's "phases".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like we, they must become pregnant and feed in order to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and children.
But surely, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one adds: "What reality-from-from-advertising movies."
Others defend the movie, and a woman admits that the song is "hysterically funny."
"I think this is brilliant.
I would've got one if I still breast-feededed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertising movie is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genial product," somebody writes.
Another comments: "This is a fun advertising film that turns to mothers who pump (often at work or at the toilet) and feels like "koss".
This is not a film that celebrates or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the movie, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discrete pump in the shore.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in a breast-feeding ho, giving women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is part-owner and ECD on Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is a so revolutionary product that it deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By dragging a parallel between women who pump breast milk and milk cores, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while we in an entertainable and easily recognized way demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headings.
During the London fashion week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk with clothes of designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved in silence to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of liberated migrant children has shot up in the height, although the number of persons crossing the border is relatively unchanged each month. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and hard politics introduced by the Government of Trump has made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own chances of staying in the country in danger by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult household members would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a higher official at the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed to the convention that the Authority had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for being references to single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by criminal authorities since earlier.
"Most 80% of people who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up dealing with children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to enter into the court within one month of their deprivation, rather than after 60 days, which was previously practice, according to staff at the posts.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their speech for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who do not have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to the staff of the posters and reports from the system in the last months.
Professors say that anxiety rises at larger plants such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s ignorement is more likely due to the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare emotionally and to take goodbye by friends, the trauma can worsen many people already struggle with.
Syria requires American, French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-President, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian ground, under the prevention of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without condition," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem underlined that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred stroke until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the land of war.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "such western countries" of "spread irrational fear" that enable refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They police something that should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel mounted Idlib has created an opportunity to proceed with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement disrupted a huge attack of Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "explicit deadlines" and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusra Front, which "will be wiped out".
The UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition will soon be gathered in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and the path of elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and said that the work of the group would be limited to "review of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a reselection
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election of 2020 if his presidentship would not end in the past through the right of the kingdom and the scandal, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever!"
Now there are no signs of the fatigue of the watchers.
Since 2014, viewing figures in best time have been more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcasting time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during large news evenings.
"This is like a fire people are attracted to, because there is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show of ABC's drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a multiannual comedy author and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Nell Scovell to me.
In the chaos there is a entertainment value.
Of course, in contrast to anything else on TV, the reporting from Washington can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigration families can be reunited and the welfare of the global economy.
Shutdown is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you suddenly have been sitting and watching for six hours at an expert panel debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" of his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of streets for $15,000 ("a cloth filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabra descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"A part of what he does make it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the trump follow-on's rotating role crew and daily intrigues (smoking disputes with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single section, you'll end up on the aftercall.
When I talked to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, there was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and owled indoor and watched MSNBC at the same time recording a shipment from CNN.
He was unable to struggle, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate's Board of Justice and the future of the Supreme Court was in the wave.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning to the end of the Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most smooth race ever before the mid-year choice
It is not surprising that the 17th Congress District of Pennsylvania receives plenty of money, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress District which has made two members now compete for the same place.
This recently surrounded suburban district in Pittsburg is represented by the democrat Conor Lamb, who had its place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republic of Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were reprinted after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republics.
The headquarters in the new 17th District have caused a campaign financing fight between the largest sections of the economic sectors of the largest parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a button gain in a widely watched special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress District.
That place had been caught by a Republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the democrats a certain precipitation.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for Chinese support but then backed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with a little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the delegates took off the leadership team of the Trump organisation.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the U.S. missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "news decided to no longer recognize Taiwan," said the Department's speaker Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which was estimated to be $140 million in US aid in 2017, among other things, to go to drug control and development and to form financial support.
The proposed penalties, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck hard against the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials set up a high level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice stopped the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in the middle of October, which is a sign of the importance of the presidential administration, said the diplomats.
And the three American messengers returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three U.S. officials, of which two diplomates agreed to discuss the internal discussions against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analytist who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step can be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's claimed abuse in the case of law, which is now clear evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to control its investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on the US election.
If the convention was to change the majority, Trump will be held responsible for that congregation just when he prepares to resume the election, and perhaps eventually before a citizen jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to claim that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the struggle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to lay a state cup against Hitler, if only the Western countries had opposed him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History deals with such decisive events, and the unsafe progress of democracy is either speeded up or braked.
The Americans are now facing several of these decisive events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen with Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he should have proposed to record the President in secret, and wondered that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says The Times reporting is not true.
"How should we answer whether the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or whether he may enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false witnesses?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections at a convention that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is faced with a dark period.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, emigrated to the United States and 60 years later, she sent me away to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hackor.
With that as an inheritance, how could I be other than optimist about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimist before the meeting with Rapid Wien
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that the victory of Austria after the impressive Spanish match against Villarreal that ended unavoidably earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee stopped the middlefielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to the 2-2 match against Villarreal. But he thinks that Rangers can use the result as a blowboard for greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the match in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Perhaps we could have brought it in at the end, but, in the largest part, it must have been a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half of the game, and we came back in the second half and it was the better team.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it's gonna be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can surely move forward and get a good result.
Last year was very hard, with everything that happened to my damage and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troop is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully, we can go forward now, put the previous season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep bad because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants had a clear picture of how they wanted to be handled, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the country - wide study said they had talked to their mates about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your husband/make and children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have great importance for the costs.
Take the help of your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term funding may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford.
Creating legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Create a nursing authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks over your medical care and ensures that the nurses follow your wishes if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also an executive authority for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are inappropriate.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an acute medical condition and is on your way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."

The victim, who is in the 40's, was in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 2:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life threatening, and the police call witnesses to hear from them.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the city of Palu in Indonesia in Friday. It tells officials. The death number is expected to rise.
Communications are disfellowshipped, and rescue staff have not yet been able to get any information from the Donggala management area, a region north of Palu closer to the epicenter of earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, which are on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city population was estimated to 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami killed.
Donggala is a management area that extends more than 300 km from the northwestern Sulawesis coast.
The management area, which is a administrative region under one province, had a population estimated to be 299 200 people in 2017.
The piles in the province of Central Sulawesis economy are fisheries and agriculture, particularly the coastal region Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past centuries, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami destroying hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, western Donggala was also affected by a tsunami who killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circumpacific seismic elderly ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh Province on the northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami affecting 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. Over half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes affected the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale struck south of Java, the most eminent island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that struck over the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake with a magnitude of 7,5 hit one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake affected the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the mortal earthquake and tsunamine in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that crashed.
2018: Large earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested for violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Guvernor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was suspected of violence in the home, in an application for violence in the home and in opposition to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska's state police.
According to the police report, he's supposed to have taken the phone from a woman's friend who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits freely in the Mat-Su arrest and is held against the capital of $500 to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the credit, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in the court in Saturday and declared himself "warranted not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected for three cases of less serious crimes according to Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 in fine.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crime according to Class B, which is punished by one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
It's not the first time Palin is accused of crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the claimed crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veterinary court.
In January 2016, he was accused of violence at home, for having been invited to report violence in the home and for possession of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of having hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to posttraumatic stress syndrome, derived from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake affected the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia in Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
The electricity supply and communications are low, and death numbers are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central Sulawesi, north-east of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit circulates now on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami struck over the coast.
Federal prosecutor claims a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutor in New York claims death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare penalty that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, must have used a car rental from the construction and interior chain Home Depot to perform an attack on a cycling road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He drove down footgängers and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious body damage, according to the deliberation of death penalty submitted to the Southern District of New York.
Both accusations may result in a death sentence, according to the court proceedings.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protective activities, which is often used by federal prosecutors in the case of organised crime, and abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "wide planning and purpose," said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "absurd, cruel and inhuman."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco injury and loss,” says the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern territory has not accused in a target where death punishment is incurred in a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for murder on two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life-long prison in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal target in New York was 1953. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples, were executed two years earlier, after being sentenced to spies for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, an Uzbekian citizen, showed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
According to the police, he announced to the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to set up the IS flag in his hospital room, the police gave up.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 points of charge.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who stated that they are "of course disappointed" at the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to claim death penalty instead of joining lifetime prison without the possibility of conditional release if the accused advocate acknowledges himself guilty only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim death punishment.
Member of the House of Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know the hot" of the European Skeptics when one of Theresa May's own Members proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already have gone out if Nigel Farage had been the Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge of Theresa May to make the deeply shared followers reconciled has been worsened by EU-positive tower members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under the attacks of Brexitan pendants, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backslag, and force EU shippers and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "kaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Laave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and had the responsibility of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the rod, we would have been out at this point," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough district in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to spray the Chequers Agreement."
He clarified his resistance to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that the general opinion would have changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
The Brexitan pendant Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'President, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is impopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopular in the party and in our voters who are out on the streets and ensure that we are chosen.
Put off the Chequers agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: "Premiral ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that the politicians must "know the hot" if they would fail the decision taken by the referendum in 2016.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, "We won't let you get away with it."
Within the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is near to betray Brexit, to feel hot.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governmental and proud UK."
At the same time, EU followers marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in central city.
A group of activists vifted with tracks with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Labour parliamentary lord Adonis from the House of Superiority mocked the conservatives for the security problems they met with a partial app when the conference opened.
"There are these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all technology for Canada plus the plus agreement, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father's.
There's no good Brexit," he added.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker of candidateing to the presidential post" after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the democratic of Massachusetts spoke of his future during a city house meeting in the western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now re-electing the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was vice-president of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the choosers since Donald Trump joined.
Someone asked her if she was planning to candidate for the presidential post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government.
A person arrested for the killing of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death shot by the LSU basket player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a movie of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen on the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University's campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in his head and eventually died of this," said the police officer Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and acknowledged that he had been on the site and had a weapon, and he acknowledged that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and brought to the prison at the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches with 10 starts the previous season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after team orders gave him profit over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hanged Hamilton out on the dry when he defended his position during the first two shippings, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first in then and let Hamilton drive in the back of the club, which should have been decisive.
Mercedesen went in a shipping later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver opposed the inside with the risk of inviting to place after a double drag to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first shipyard on its 21th anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held the tyres to reach a fast target and drive around Kimi Raikkon and become four.
Finally, he arrived at the depot on the 44th shipyard but failed to increase the speed during the remaining eight shipping shipping when Raikkon went up on the fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," said Hamilton.
Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to judges of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly take the Ford witness before the Senate's Justice Committee, but he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elake, illicit and lieful."
"The only thing that could happen and the fine thing that has happened in the past days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, evil, disgusting and lieful," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks and they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
"Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I have not darkened Ford's accusations, I have not leaked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidentially, as she wanted."
But her dementia seems not to have fit the President, who commented on this Saturday night: "I'll tell you one thing, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate for the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control," said the president, according to the Digital News Site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sentenced the loss of Friday in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received a early two-point leadership by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie receipted the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giant's leadership.
Francois Bouchard receipted Dundee before two targets from Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season of Adam Keefe's law, which came from the back and hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting for the season of the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 at Kendall McFaull's assist, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan brought back home team into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who receipted at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard receipted once again with a target in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the leadership for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with his team's fifth halfway through the end period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of its last five matches, will play at Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Flyers died for hundreds of people on a plane to escape earthquake
A fly leader in Indonesia is now celebrated as a hero after he descended when he made sure that a plane of hundreds of people on board could be lifted safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake affected the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftercalls continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the boots of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swimming control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Airs flight 6321, which was then on the startway, could be lifted safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would break.
He descended later to the hospital.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he descended this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
We are crushed by hearing this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the death number may rise to over a thousand people. The country's emergency aid authority says that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death number is believed to continue to grow because there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying in help and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
There's little clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help survivors, but we don't know what they will meet there.
This is already a tragedy, but it may be much worse."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" According to CNN.
Indonesia was affected earlier this year by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plan that crashed in a Lagune in the Pacific Sea, now reports that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evakuated from the sinking plane and were in security.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions on more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land on the airport in the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, officials stated that seven persons had been brought to hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable.
It's still unclear what caused the crash and what the event progress looked like.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing course.
Some Witnesses believed that the plane was crossing the landing course.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wave through mid-deep water to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the cabin staff had panic and scream, and that he had a smaller head damage.
The U.S. fleet said that sailors working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using a rewindable boat to drive people in land before the plane fell in the 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that 111 people have been killed in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analytics draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor ended his plea in the second trial against a man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analytist of the U.S. Department of Justice, spoke for hours as expert witnesses in the field of notification analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile lists to puzzle the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received localisation data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claims, reported the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis reported that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to begin its ending on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be submitted to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far away from its origin in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a rise in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?!
A child girl in New York matches a couple because of dismissal after a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York matches a couple for discrimination after she received a missigned text message from the mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racists and compare the temper with "expression".
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed fear when she realized that Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first workday 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEY NOT AND SWART NOT," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she had realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "wick to modes," and gave Maurice fired, and claimed that their former child girl, who was African, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Phillip woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day of work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she meets the couple to get compensation for the dismissal. She requests compensation in the size order $350 per day for the job she was from the beginning employed to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple turns off the accusations that they would be racists and say that the only right thing was to finish Giselle Maurice's job. They were worried that they couldn't trust her after they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been unfamiliar with, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the mood with "expression" and said that his wife would be born children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to give up on such a person?
It's not very nice done," added the Investment Banker Plasco.
The legal process is still in progress, but the general opinion has quickly condemned the couple of social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers didn't think the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born just after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told me that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the childbook, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly delighted" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family," and added that her father was proud in the silence of his final success.
"He was quite silent of himself, and not any prideful person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeded in something. You become proud of the child even though it is not you who have achieved it.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor himself."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, and that it was not expected she would be okay," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye from her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll be right back to you.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there waiting and know that all this happened.
I could not swear or cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved the loss of her daughter, went on the planet along with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she went through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and my tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Swallowing women set up vy cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost related because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells her son was a promising cook that had an infectious smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother when he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards to people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a while after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he acted differently.
On Christmas, he was on the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas gifts, he had no eye contact with them or something."
She says that his death was a very hard battle for them, but they have to get through it. "It's breaking up a wound in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked - a investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might have a little agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee would be "split" due to deeply rooted differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his republic followers want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their contradiction depends on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the one they want to have chosen to the High Court of Justice of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow vice-president Mike Pence to break the death situation and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean "sunchers" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who jump to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, says 1 127 people jumped from last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees to smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Finally, most of North Korea’s riders are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans must have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fly through China, which has the longest border towards North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hardly monitored demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the profanes as illegal migrants rather than as refugees, and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between North and South, which is technically still in war with each other, has been significantly improved in recent months.
Previously in the month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for discussions focusing on the fixed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US penalties for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot absolutely unilaterally disarmament ourselves first," said Ri at a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority chairman of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperately inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help me thinking that if a woman had acted so, she would be called 'hysterical'," said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally affected, and at times he screamed almost and the voice stuck when he spoke of his family and his years at high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the Committee, and said that the accusations against him were a "large and coordinated character murder" organised by liberals who were angry for the loss of the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s witness proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was partial to the disadvantages of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh before the court if he was elected, and if the Democrats receive a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that she as a democrator was concerned about what decision Kavanaugh might take against the health insurance law Affordable Care Act or the abortion target Roe vs. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not the case for a hysterical and partial person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It's a fair criticism, months and years of anger that cooks over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We weep when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual."
And she continued: "I received good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cryed when she became angry, but had developed a technology that meant when she became angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to: 'you might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she continued.
I thought it was glorious."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cryed out of unprecedented anger, was that I was taken into the force of an older woman. It was a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry, and they're happy they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic Congress member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was captured with an outmarried shop on a boat named Monkey Business and went out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason to investigate the idea of standing in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well thoughtful decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow and the seven dwarfs."
Because she was late out she was behind the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get two million dollars together.
It was a project convicted to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential election campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to address electors rather than delegates, and anger against sexism, that the voice stood.
"You could've thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder remembers the press's reactions.
"There could have been thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my grave stone?"
"She's crying?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening tarad in the trade war between the United States and China was ear-devastating. The war is far from over, but the break between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by declaring important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs duties.
The most important entrance came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods coming into the United States from China are customs duty.
Beijing has replied with the same coin every time. Recently, charges of between five and ten percent of US goods were dropped for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the actions of the United States. The world’s second largest economy is likely not to step down in overlookable time.
To get Washington backing means to bow for demands, but public crying for the United States would be quite too genant for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the press from the US trade war can give a positive support to China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependency of the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create prerequisites for economic panic in each country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to acknowledge," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the Medical Center for New American Security.
Syria 'redo' for refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntarily returning refugees and asks for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and safe, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for voluntarily returning refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic actions aimed at their daily lives and upholding.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syria have moved the country since the war began in 2011.
Additional six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries who have supported the rebellion.
Europe departed with the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the final 16,5 versus 10,5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European ground and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjørn team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during the largest part of the tournament, ended up in the water at the end of the 16th pair of the hole 3-way, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 & 4 of the lowest ranched players of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking players, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, which may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European tournament ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It is about the team, and I am glad that I could be helpful," said a touched Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He left the stab to his landlord John Ram who defeated the American golf-layer Tiger Woods 2&1 in single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I'm raised to look at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A strange statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been exceeded by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
The American Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's depressive performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was this morning when we increased the temperature in Europe.
We took the fist.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All his 12 players played really good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You'll have to bow and bow.
They played better than we."
Algae flower: Holders decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fisheries and Wild Commission shows a general reduction in concentrations of algae flowers for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more unequal flowers are reported in areas around the major municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which can indicate reduced levels.
The alg flower extends over 20 miles from the coast, from the north Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Flecks can be seen about a mile out in the sea outside the Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algae flower has also been observed in the large municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports on respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
