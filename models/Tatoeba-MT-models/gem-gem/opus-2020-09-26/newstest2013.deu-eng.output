A Republican strategy to counteract the revaluation of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter as a myth by confirming that the election fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by flashes.
In addition, in the United States, the lawyers of the Republicans have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in 10 years.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US States are responsible for the implementation of elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of the US governments have been proclaiming new laws since 2009 which have difficulties in the registration or incentive procedure.
This phenomenon has gained importance following the elections from November 2010, where 675 new republic representatives could be recorded in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the election law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the voters to present a photo card and evidence of the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for the premature voting fee, declare the right to register as elector on the day of election, and the nationals agree with the right of election for which a court act existed.
Before 2006's elections, no US State has required the voters to show a photo card.
Indiana was the first state of the state who has raised such a claim.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republic authorities quickly expanded this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they promoted draft laws in 34 states, which forced the voters to show a photo card.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, that is 21 million elected persons, have no light card issued by a government authority of their State.
In addition, five million new choosers in 2012 do not have such an ID.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid in order to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people in proportion.
In fact, 25% of the African Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo card.
This is still enough.
The students who are considered to be electors who give their voice more and more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo card issued by their establishment in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow Members of Angel or Hunting Associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state of the state requested a proof of citizenship for choosing.
Arizona was the first federal state that introduced such an claim.
Since 2011, a dozen countries have adopted laws that require the voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Historical votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three historic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, republic lawgivers in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states with which the registration of voters was dismissed on the election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for choosing registration in 2004's general elections have contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new choosers in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections, 33% of the voters who chose in advance were African Americans, although they are only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Historical population.
Last was only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the people who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites represented 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their adherents have strongly opposed the adoption of laws which restrict the registration of the voters.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US General Advocate has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have adopted laws which require the display of a light map.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the election law.
The democratic critics emphasize the party-political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries preparing for 2012.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the states that adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the election body to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer prior identification: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes mismatching results, with wrong negative or but also wrong positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger delay for the already undecisive men to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We have received the opinion of two experts.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to provide clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that when monitoring after 12 years, the probability of the formation of metastases is by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years when you have a direct relative who had already been sick of prostate cancer.
In men of Afro-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer disease has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and other indolent.
The patient must really be understood the extent of the risk of his cancer disease by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is rather decided to monitor the disease actively.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer do not treat them because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They are proposed to be monitored actively and are offered treatment in advance of the disease.
The criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who is not, are determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether it should be done or not.
In collaboration with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed a tool to assess the benefits and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in research, adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of sickness.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
The fight against tobacco dependency remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It is very harmful to human health.
"Now there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of death to cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grimm tarm, mast tarm, eating tubes, pancreas and liver cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity is protecting against cerebral cancer throughout life," he adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much amount, it increases the risk of disease in a wrestling or mast tumor cancer.
Warts should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat through smoke, drying or salts may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamine
In recent years several scientists have examined the link between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not firm at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are inconsistent.
While one study discovered the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was more likely to increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preload.
"The execution of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Boson has excited a certain appearance last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "most false" explanation of nature and behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not quite sure that it is really the Higgs.
Without the shadow of doubt, we know that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics convention in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be absolutely certain about it.
Yet, let's assume that it is really the Higgs, as it seems to be a small risk of deceiving, and let's look at what it is about.
There is a necessarily unusual law in this world that makes two objects not available at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strong as you will hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it is evident that such a law is also applicable to them: the Pauli's rule of exclusion, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantity state", whereas this "state" largely consists of some of their properties.
From this the physicians divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens who are called Fermione and who are kindly obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, a bad band of anarchists who are not holy - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same place at the same time.
These Bosons, according to The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing), are divided into two groups: the mesons we are not going to treat here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs boson would be related somehow.
But it must be stressed here that these Bosones are not all such exotic creatures as they might think.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boston of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of the electromagnetic power.
For if a particle is accelerated with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "destructed" precisely in this place, in like a silver stone thrown into a pond.
This "defect" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the Bosones "trailers of power".
Stabler Field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "shooted" in order to show this Boson.
However, the higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the bacteria must achieve very high energy, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a paper would never hold of itself at the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it possess a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not have mass.
For what can all these researches now be "good", Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicians to examine all the differences between the observations and SME predictions.
Moreover, there are numerous physicians who most likely hope that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has great deficiencies, as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the material of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no.
Moreover, in the early 60s, the laser pioneers did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the dead physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first permanent stroke laser (the first were pumped) - already said that the laser was viewed at the beginning rather than a laboratory.
Imagine...
Furthermore, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
In 1969, for example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optic work.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eyes" and has introduced the nobel price for physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our life, but it means that you can really never know...
Palliative Care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on Death in Dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the warm question of the end of life.
The debate must be restarted soon, although a draft law is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to consider this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that injured him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at his home for the Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the morning.
"Always it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
At the table sitting before a delicious lunch, he willingly resigns to be helped at dinner.
Courageously, even, he is able to smile and talk to the strangers around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of normal death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea because this is humiliating," he informs.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man pinches in standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person," taking a back step, he finds.
For several people who work in the Palliative Care are believed to take place major events in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are instructed to the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectation of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer caught by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by swelling".
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want any more in life," she says before she accepts a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy in the next few days.
In Victor-Gadbois home you offer a group of volunteer body care and assistive position in the food recording.
The Palliative Care is then used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11.700 inhabitants come to a bed for the Palliative Care.
This is very little if you take into account that one day we will all die.
Here life is continued under the best conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the desire, you will receive an oral care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served Mr. X a beer that died over the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer to the feet of the dead.
"We also help families and patients," reports Nurse Director Nathalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
Besides an old man of 93 years of age who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his headchases, while he is honourable, a 36 - year - old young man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies in a tragic way after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients instructed at Victor-Gadbois home come from their residence, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to Palliative Care, i.e. to a care that should facilitate patients’ suffering when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois home and the family for home palliative care in Montreal large room, specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specialised in the Palliative Care are looking forward to the adoption of a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October, a manifest in circulation has been signed by prominent personalities of Palliative Care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all rights to a high-quality palliative care have before you accept to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear the patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate healthcare.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite worst forecasts, forbidden until the last day.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a disturbing chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'm going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I was going to fight, she told her.
But she told me I was at the end!
No Omnipotent Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thanks to the nursing personnel that it has not made this wish after their pain has been relieved by a team of Palliative Care.
However, it must be clearly stated that the palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Great Space of Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often react to the terminal sedation that is going on to insulating the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can't do this anymore as if we don't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be more and more frequently able to react to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not relieved say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want you to sleep me," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism grant of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate candale large sizes in Quebec
Officers of the road construction agency, companies of the main construction industry, monetary operators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia report every day what they know about a great "system" in which construction economy, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are scattered.
A "Industry" was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is breaking down since you have taken drastic action," says Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former Head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him due to a thorough examination of the disturbances related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only unwillingly agreed.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribes of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport had saved a billion dollars on the contracts alone, because some were instinctive to obtain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to fall," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in showing "the tactics behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to economic auditors, investigators and analytists of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau troop" that since 2009 has resulted in the "canal mapll" of Montreal in the artificial breakdown of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has conducted a series of house searches and accused of fraud and corruption against municipal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has retired from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that, in the exchange of public orders, it has repeatedly received butterfly money.
Explicitly, engineers were accused of the street construction office of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has excited by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for receiving public contracts.
For several years, he paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary related to the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game all over by giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to province parties, especially to the liberals that were then in power.
He also admitted to organising an illegal procurement of funds for former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channeling contracts whose costs were artificially charged by it
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant has detailedly described this before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribe money of $736,000 as a return to channeling contracts whose costs he artificially charged.
Other officials of the road construction agency have admitted that they were being smeared by artificially raising the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, a organiser of the Mayor Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget filling his boxes with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr Tremblay has retired in early November, which led to a serious crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal who hit alarm.
As Mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she rejected the sale of a communal property from 2010 that was purchased for $5 million and re-saled for 1.6 million to farmers in the growing real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says that it "drags on a thread that enables it to understand the functionality of the ants submerged system, to stop the evil and to blame the guilty ones".
She says that the procedure is "powerful but positive".
We are working to clean the wound, but we need a detection unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his part, notes that "officers have stolen several hundred million dollars," but considers, above all, the role of the "manufacturers who are in the picture" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a proportion of 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he cracks: "I was told that this was just a weak bill of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to restrict donations to parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "As long as the elections are not strictly limited, black money in politics will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete revision of the system of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about throwing a look in their own rear courtyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparing training of INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progressive progress.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to spending games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the head and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti embraces respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is no comparable person at present, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many songs with viewed associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a injury series.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're laying behind.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves for the eighthfinale in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European crews.
First of all, we want to be our first group in front of Porto so that we can carry out the return of the eighthfinale as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in a short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a large European association, Paris has to win titles and make himself a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG shall provide funds for this project to adopt concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as it was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really the heart of us to disappear this title.
In the last season, we were close to it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry away the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another crew, those of Montpellier, has achieved a even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux call the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much of the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can imagine, this is certainly a frustrating thing.
You wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A crew builds up in time.
In the Champions League we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a association that has not been able to qualify for the eighthfinal since two seasons, and which has also made huge expenditure!
In view of the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points in advance!
That meant that our opponents and the French mastership would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To be so better that you talk about a Zlatan dependency.
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he has seen that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from kicking out some time.
I've seen things that I've been strengthening.
Today I am able to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our doctrine, and today we have to show an exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players, and appeals to victory.
Like it was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does this, on October 16 in Spain, represent the forced dispute (1:1) of a play of commencement?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has taken advantage of all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payments and sales are possible without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as often as these technologies are a political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but can be converted into dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15.000 computers in the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin reached a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23) in June 2011, he fell five months later to $2 before he recovered to around $10 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that can be won or purchased by games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time storers of the accounts, auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins handled are available in the accounts of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This takes place via a mathematical task launched on the computers, whereas the winner, who is a kind of preliminary central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add to it a number before the whole is "hacked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can hardly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money two times very fast (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without a link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer who has solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred million set, which leaves a certain gambling space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in calculating performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also reveals these deficiencies.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the account and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "Mega Slot Sales" was launched.
"Three thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, converted Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with dealers, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "fotografed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend where hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin continues, but 2013 could be a turning point," he forecasts.
In its report, the ECB also provides for the revaluation of the various risks considered today in the event of the success of this currency.
We've departed from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the USA are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take the possession of its territory again and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders fleeing to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries and archaeic traditions, even if they have joined jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbekians and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base point of Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with mantle trees financed by French loans, has been properly done.
The truck and tank convoys overflowed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more flows from the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have been changed since their irresistible premarch from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was transferred from war because of the battles of the various rebellious groups.
Their takeover was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price of obskurantism for the farmers overwhelmed by Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war have returned to power in 2001.
They have transformed themselves into business dealers by encamping the land of the government to sell them as a land of construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American subcontracting.
They put themselves in trial, and most of them were not involved in the fights themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not composed of thiefs.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of American benefits: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and his ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is below 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obskurantism of the single parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represents a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
A army is now present.
Will the authorities under whose command it will stand be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already trying to restore the military in the province that will be withdrawn from the power of the Central Government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identity should have benefited from a certain decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by the abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, which was since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidial power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially in the event of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long ago.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional plants are not available and important watering systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a 30-year-old country of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The reputation was widespread that Afghanistan owned enormous soil treasures.
This reinforces the impression that western countries were only on site to authorise it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper on-site or without transport for exports through the mountains, there is no mine.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) in the huge Buddhist place are making their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French battle forces was completed on 20 November.
The new collaboration agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and young people's gymnasia, Institute for French at the universities, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military" of the Defense Ministry (Cimic), set up in 2012, has carried out numerous publicly useful work and actions for the repair of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "herts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of the compatibility of aids and open actions.
These work, for which many local workers were needed, could have helped to suppress the resurrection: watering, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave back for military expenditure from two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard in these more than 2000 metres tall valleys.
In the message, thousands of written requests of small agricultural projects have been received by municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to liberate farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which is according to their own statements their desire, it would be necessary to continue smaller, more well controlled and directly affected civil assistance to their benefit.
A Constitution with the Breast Song in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever split with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily gives him unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly will adopt its final version on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a preliminary, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal contradiction.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "treat the right with feet".
On the side of its advocates, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to refuse their project to explain the text section for section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of finding its public and democratic legitimacy again while the protest kills throughout the country.
After confirmation in an interview with the American Weekly View Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
Especially to the Egyptian people with this withdrawal to an overhaasting vote, an Ultimate: "You agree for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should suspectly end after the constitution was adopted.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constitutional Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away because they believe that they have not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To achieve the decision-making capacity last morning, 11 persons, vice-presidents, were added in all haste.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
In addition, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference in opinion of the day... was expressed for prayer at the time, since some members of the body believed that the penelury of the constitutional congregation was not exactly gone.
The text that was adopted last evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which took all the attention, remains in the same way with that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a more strict application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Shamefulness" responds to the liberals who only consider this a propaganda struggle.
They say that the Islamization of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In particular, they have seen Article 220 in the eye, which acknowledges an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are requested for an opinion have not been chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
The first signs of theocracy can be seen in this.
The fears of the Liberals are also devoted to the fact that the next director of this university is likely to be far less than the current.
"Not a specific religious commitment is being recognized at present.
With this constitution, we remain in the context of the civilian state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have partly been trained in the French system," Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
However, he admits, "that, in respect of Article 220, there may be a multi-definition, since the terms used are rejected from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamian case law, note d. Red].
And in the future, the question could be raised in how far civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised because of the extensive powers he has given to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these have been significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the request of the military, the examination of the defence budget is presented to Parliament not but to a national Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also informs their fears regarding the text that they regard as threatening to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy is maintained, and injuries are now forbidden, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on TV last night, demonstrations are planned for today afternoon.
The professors of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and an unaffected nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Bend Without the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It says that everyone who is bathing in this river receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, the stilling of the storm and fishing.
Here, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Faithful people are doing the path or crossway of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossing place, the salvation stone and the grave of Jesus is located.
This is the Christian view of the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend, according to the tree from which the Cross was made for Jesus ’ crucification.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Claims, the remnants of a temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various religions there leave notes with wishes, which then are fulfilled.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies, which Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins with their own power.
All others bring an air sealway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters, the famous ski area Hermon is located, where there are numerous tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttlebus.
The shippers have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, it was said that pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
At only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting ones should have a visit.
Among these is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exponents are stored.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Al Basha bath, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bath service.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Relli Museum where you can admire images of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops.
The entry is free, and donations are fundamentally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most important department is the monument for the children, built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died.
The Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do Something for Health
The three main refreshing areas of Israel are located on the Mediterranean coasts, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed during the winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air is warmed up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing throughout the year.
Moreover, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
His turquoise blue water has a high salt content, and it even carries non-swimmers without problems on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing mucosal as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease, and to reassure stroked nerves.
To touch the secrets of old age
These secrets contain the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were linked.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to swallow through the narrow streets named by star signs.
Fortune shall be the legend according to all those who touch the walls in the street with their star mark.
In Jaffa you can meet newly broken couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Cross Ridges.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governor, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, concerts and opera are listed today.
Watchlist for Tourists
If you travel to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: approximately 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is preferable to take into no euros, but in dollars that can simply be switched into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you are mostly coming forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a railway railway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations that connect the subtown to the upper city.
Exactly, it is a underground stand seal path.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, which includes climbing for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will take place in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and businesses are closed and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and guest places, only cosque food is served, excluding swine meat, sea products, fish without shoes and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammel and beef meat, soups and desserts (prepared with cocose milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, freezed balls of purified beans and herbs (falafels) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no exciting dogs.
For this, there are many well-feeded cats, which run cosy and unhealthy through the streets.
In the evening, they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like living places and don't say no to delicious.
Car rental costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 per day (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
Insurance also costs $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Access cards for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventures and seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 Thousands of Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparative period in 2010, before the abolition of the visum obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and civil lawyers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with false certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families remaining in the homeland.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each migrant of work, must give a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in local housing and in retail trade.
However, tests will in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority, become a duty for all guest workers.
It is not only necessary to put language tests, but also tests into the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills need to be demonstrated for both receipt and prolongation of labour permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian official language is.
Similarly, those who received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the destruction of the USSR in 1991 are excluded from this law.
Senses, problematics and protection of rights
The total of the exams will be under the Egide of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Sankt Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can carry out the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens' laws asked several times: What does this actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to demonstrate language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, against speakers of the migration authority, it is to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many now talk about the protection of labour migrants' rights," says Viktor Sebelew, Head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
Immigrants face problems without vocational, educational, language skills and medical review.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will compete with people with evil intentions who will put him under the suggestion of help into a dark, narrow barcke, where he will endure with dozens of his same months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland, you will be promised one, and at arrival you will be deceived, their passports will be taken off and won't receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the head of the work migration of the Tadschikian migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't cheat, boss!
Yet, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only able to control the language of the target country, but they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbekmen and Tadschiks can also afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, silently, but to buy them decent clothes, shoes and schools.
As a teenager, these children will immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizen lawyers highlight the following important aspects in relation to the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to leave the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Accession for Unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Huschkadamov comments to journalists.
"No cost for false papers"
Already on the day when the law entered into force, it was found that not only the registration documents of migrants can be false.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by staff of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a work migrant three thousand rubles.
The most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that certifications cannot be purchased, both officials and civil lawyers agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise host workers who fall through the test for the first time only that they will receive time for a language basis course.
In addition, newcomers are offered jobs in areas where there is no need for active communication with people.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
Participation of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Interior plans to reinforce the Arms Act for Private Arms Owners.
This means that the authorities respond to recent events: injured in the case of shooting on weddings and seven dead in the amoclope of the Moscow jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the carrying of non-dead weapons in the public and increase the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported and promised the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted soon.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
On the Internet an open letter was published, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - demand from the authorities to take away "supercase exacerbations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, expressed by the criminal lawyer, Wasily Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the use of the registered weapons over the period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand delicates were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a reinforcement of the law for private arms owners of criminals will not prevent themselves from being used on the black market.
Nowadays, the authors of Moscow say they can find every possible weapon for little money.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come through several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Stage.
Screenshot of a site that accepts weapon orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly by police officers.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms camps.
Many military camps often encountered explosions.
"There are evidence that in some cases it was burning to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market also provides the weapons manufacturers.
"Today there are numerous private armor factories that do not stand up with international competition and therefore swallow the weapons under hand on the black market, such as in Moscow,," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kirgizia.
"There is a own, sometimes craftsmanufacturing and a mafia that organizes the butterfly," explains the former military family.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011 a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available information on weapons portals.
The main part of the illegal weapons, according to the detectives, comes from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons in the black market were there by "the debt of responsible persons who have come to deal with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers' data, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% descende from thefts in the production of weapons and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor of a weapons shop which does not want to be mentioned above assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been buying nobody since they are out of the way.
According to him, it is more frequent that dealers get the replacement in a arms camp.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is bought over a fenrik.
The gun is issued and passed through the door.
"The dealer brings the weapon into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police, of course, knows about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan for detection of crime, regularly carry out control purchases in dealers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"As in the luxury"
Buyers and sellers find most frequently about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when somebody turned attention to me and suggested me to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there you have to go there and get along with a code like "of Iwan Iwanovitsch, who makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am at the moment even getting to some slaughters about a friend I trust.
He also delivers me the sleeves only because he knows that I don't screw him.
New ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," remembers the military.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says in the advertising ad on the website "Please buy gun or gun".
There users give up your orders and make requests.
Are you also selling to minors?
"Of course without a license", users ask "Iwan" (orthical quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless sheet websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
People come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and may swallow coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable.
The responsibilities accept the orders.
The buyer oversees the money via a banking machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the publicly useful organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can even go out empty and come behind grids if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless sheet websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and have to swallow coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US dollars
In the purchase of illegal shooting weapons, experts are expected to have prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the Organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarow for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by supervisors of middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of delicates with illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States Fast Food and Supermarket Employees
Every fourth American youth sits behind the box of Mc Donald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests against low wages throughout the United States in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food cats such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one yet can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go back to air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several links-oriented publicly useful organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple walmart and fast-food workers, the organisations of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
Until now, this industry is hardly cooperatively organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, at which sales took place in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to hands.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put down their work and struggled with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group of people is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from winds over hunting guns and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart-Filials is between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the poorly paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the product only so favourably because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complains about difficult working conditions, such as lack of barbecue or hand scanner.
Participants of the protests at "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their dispute that the contribution to the company's own health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart colleague who deserves 9.5 dollars the hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley show that if the company increases the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost $3.2 billion Walmart.
That is approximately 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart would kill the wages totally on the customers, each purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today's additional expenditure of only $12.39.
Advocates of Walmart satisfy the fact that only nine states protested and did not save any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted in its shop from 8 a.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in that period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart boxes performed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, argued in an interview on the website of the left-handed Huffington Post that totally "less than five" Walmart employees had been working and the protest action was simply "a further PR-trick" of the trade unions organised by the protests.
"Fried box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart-Filials (which are not desired in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent so far), but were McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and averagely their simple employees in New York receive 8.90 US dollars the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it's possible to get out of here in New York with so little money, I can't understand.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youths after school at McDonald's behind the theke were still living with their parents.
Nearly one saw the main source of income or planted to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who regret that they have to come out with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to get children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests who started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cassiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars the hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the creation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The US-American law forbids business management to stand in the way of this goal and to remind or dismiss trade unions members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were soundprotests this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protest was a congregation on the noon before the McDonald's on the Times Square, where some local democratics spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democracies, for example, Mayor Candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employees so that they can gain a fair reward and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of their species in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on this place, of which not all of them are in the fast-food industry, working in New York tens of thousands.
It is not yet possible to see if the radio of these protests will mobilise all the masses.
"To date, the brain can only be overlisted moderately"
The topic of the extended reality, popular with the adherents of modern technologies, is usually seen by the lens of a special glass in recent times.
First in the summer, Google presented a working model at his annual conference, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also signed an appropriate patent.
However, in conversation with the director of the Group for Interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with just hands and creating virtual surfaces.
- Please just describe what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of human and machinery, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has remained mostly in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to see 5-10 years in advance and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today, no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in movement control.
- What else are we expecting in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional performance systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fashionable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its surroundings are recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this dirty Virtual Reality helmet!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she over-evaluated?
- It is certainly not the solution of all purpose, since it raises questions about privacy because you do not always want to inform all those around your actions and intents.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular nice.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project where we experimented with short and tight instead of with exhaustive gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically, it could be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
However, overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as geist and language.
- How?
We'd ask you, for example, to give you this spraydose?
They say it and simultaneously suggest it.
- Usually, I'm just telling you.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the respective time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we need to work mainly on the development of new sensor types that enable people to get more accurate responses.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What are your claims based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main cause is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too few for gestures, especially.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with a regulatable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, where today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed a device just without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It is not intended to calculate the object depth.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, Kinect-like system, where we could play with different camera tendencies to identify how this helps us to detect a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember well, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the road, but I think the following: The most great variant would be a "changed" extended reality, where we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working together with other virtual objects.
- For a moment, imagine that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also normal mortal accessible.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers will your group give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between human and machine.
I think that the eightth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
It is a great deal of pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at granting the "pictures in the air" something firmly, for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasonic beams at a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak at the moment, as if someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nervous ends in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overliste the brain?
It makes it think that it feels what it should feel if it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely, a person who is physically located in a closed room, to believe that he is in an open, practically infinite space instead; here we work on concepts with loop bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
So far the brain can only be moderately overlisted, and there are many working years ahead of us.
That is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: in many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde" dedicated to town inhabitants who form the avantgarde of art and culture.
On the read list, high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene already landed, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and often finds recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded ones dressed in red, which are encountered at the Russian museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings, or at Vernissacks.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract great crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and defiantly by his presence on the streets his fellow citizens a smile in their face and brings them good fun.
Recently, he took a turnhorgel and became Petersburg's Drehorgel player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artistic behavior, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not for example in yellow or Turkkis in town?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer who disagrees with the optics and image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that is different from the grain worm is causing aggression and bad conduct.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became acquainted with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of Gazonewschina; of which "Puschkinskaja 10" arose, and then was the first time ended.
It draws me to theater, to the fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this united in your art clinic it was important for me to be the focus of Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists should gather together.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artist club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburger Bohemia, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Snur and his friends sang simple songs to play back, wore close tricots, and one of them was the composer Igor Wdowin, who said today.
When the group began to play live, it became from her "lening wheel".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he learned with us.
The Gallery "D 137" or the club "Gribodov" also originates in the Art Clinic.
Our staff and family guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a press survey on the award of "the personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I reached the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unidentifiable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the topic "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to have been social, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be like that.
In a clown, all of this is blurred and lost his tragedy.
I love the Great, and I have big ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribe that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone watchs the clothes and orients themselves at the outer, not at the inside of the man.
But maybe you can't give a man a hand, but you should kick him in his face.
The deceit disappears by the clothing.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's turnhorgel player, a cultural town should have such a hero.
Who, if I don't?
- Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- Commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering today.
We see the destruction of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you will like.
Now each cult star has about 100 trailers.
- But there are several thousands of Stas Michailow's shows!
- To him, abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a part.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and everything is destroyed.
I have attendants, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not destroy it.
In my youth I painted those pictures that even hang with a collector in a series of the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said to serve the culture.
But not everyone of them can deal with culture.
The real scars were different, because the Zars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are needed.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some experts, but they are locked up because they need high-level experts who correctly evaluate the first ones and free them.
Now it counts only your own taste.
The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to search for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding soil.
It is hard to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural nutrition soil because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it's much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the past century.
The project is financed from subsidy of the city of St. Petersburg
Birth in the Space
Earth in danger.
Earth heating or collision with killerasteroid.
Carawans of spaceships with earthly inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question about how we can continue to grow in gravity or on the replacement planet?
I think there are no many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least inhabit hypotheticly.
"Precisely Mars and Venus," says the scientist of the astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of the Venus exists a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in a large height or in the circuit of the Venus, i.e. in the All.
The question of reproduction in All, the researchers first addressed the flora.
Already a half century before that, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of heritage grown in the Orbit was not at least different from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of small fruitflies (Drosophila), in the Orbit.
In 1979, waitleeiers were sent to the universe to investigate how gravity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chicken must find stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chicks were wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn fell completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chickens run and then put the whole thing in, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Wladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chicks in All.
The last grocery with animals flew to the courtyard 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only will be equal sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized to the All.
In principle, there was nothing special in this regard.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," says Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats had grown up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals who are ripped out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproduction drive.
Unlike animals, the human being could be principleal.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to the All for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing mankind has is the female organism.
Our mows fled away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Nobody finally answered this question," says the space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman born in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was two times in the office and even worked outside the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy adults.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying to the Orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and production of artificial gravitation.
The Hydrolabor in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
The cosmonauts win routine for the work in the open space.
The water represents gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Jagtyanders would testify that life on the land came from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the abdomen of the mother in the fertile water about 9 months, and that it can be easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just just two weeks.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, for a newborn child, gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdomen and pelvis muscles decrease enormously rapidly and thus decreases the ability to push the child out.
All right, let's deal with this through birth-introduction aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?", is the non-significant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the bone and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in the arbitrary as an adult for training in a burden suit.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we conduct together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person, a completely unadapted human," predicts the head of the Bioethic Commission of the Institute for Medical Biobiological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Until now, the birth of children in the universe is just theory.
But at some point she will be real when the earth's inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a remote planet, which will be the home for their inherited descendants.
NKU-Chef: Control of the Black System fails by debts of politics
Czech Republic has good control facilities and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but does not apply.
The Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neivyší controlní úřad, NKU), Miloslav Kala, has said this in the conversation for Aktuálně.cz.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be properly applied - and this is not the case with us,” comments Kala on the current situation.
It seems that a similar result is also a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he introduces the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system therefore forbidden or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then can't just come to the president of the government, and the control agency whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, inhibits its activity," says Kala.
During the meeting of the Committee of Auditors of the Chamber of Members, you spoke of a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries were compared with public contracts.
What was it specifically about?
It is a parallel test that we started with about two years ago.
Simplified, it is the fact that the European Legislative sets out how public orders should be handled, which is based on national legislation, and eventually the actual practical application is still available.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to detect extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws may even be something "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
Just such a common control could help us stop and constantly try to perfect the laws and to reduce and distinct threshold values, if this seems to be not particularly positive.
Economy means to acquire a matter at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and exclude illegal enrichment or even crime.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that we load the system in this way only with excessive "paper cramp" and those looking for gaps in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech award law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a authority similar to our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant to the NKU of the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar to that of us, and also has a colleague that is just formed something different, but in principle both authorities are working similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state of state, i.e. that these accounts are also available in each federal country - in which the German system differs from our.
The BRH may only control federal funds which correspond to our government funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting offices.
With regard to German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific details, but in some respects Germany is often called a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is in all things better.
Is that perhaps because the inspectors are better there?
I don't think so, but as I said, I don't like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are models for us also have to deal with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything of cooperation with our authority, would they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, what was the significance of the novellation of the award law for your authority, do you feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this Novelle is only a short time in force, it has not yet affected our tests.
Since our controls take place afterwards, there must be a certain delay here.
As far as we have experienced impacts in the preparation phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of inequality" and analysed and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tendering have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system loaded with further bureaucracy?
I believe that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hopes that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem can be that the rules will become "stricter" and can no longer be respected.
Already under the previous rules, those subject to a review are accountable to the institution (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the award law corresponds to a infringement of budgetary discipline.
But is it useful to make the law even more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let us say which way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not relieve the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black System" - exactly what does that mean?
Is the black system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then can not simply come to the president of the government, and the control office whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law can interfere with its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do this as if nothing was.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also appropriate for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing in us.
On the streets there is single ice smoothness, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic is partly snow and ice smooth.
However, the roads are mostly well travelable, sometimes increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well travelable this morning, in a single manner of snow and ice smoothness.
The temperatures decreased to -5 °C to -10 °C, it's supposed to be somewhat warmer over the day.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the deeper heights it remains just a thin snow cover.
However, the rooms of the mountain are about 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Road Guard, there was restricted view of fogs.
The Railway R6 and the roadways of the first road class in the region are currently free of charge.
However, attention is given, for example, to bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
Similarly, all roads of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, are travelling.
However, in these streets there remains irrigational or excreted snowest.
In particular in the higher layers, more attention is therefore required.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads East Böhmens is dangerous for ice smoothness, higher lags and in the mountains is sometimes on the streets a far-reached snow layer, the road and motorway direction informs them on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers against ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher levels in the district of Pardubice.
It can come to ice smooth, especially on roads of the second and third road class in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 for Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is located especially on the streets in the giant mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
A rainy snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohmen it is mainly sunny or warmer today, and it remains largely defeatless.
The temperatures are between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Area Arrows
The streets in the Pilsen district are well travelable today, but local attention is offered, and the route is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and then the temperatures fall, it can be ice smooth on the streets.
It is also expected to be fog locally, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
These data are from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but increased attention, however, recommends the roadmasters between 80. and 131. km.
The highways of the first road class are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smooth can be cut off.
The roadways of the second and third road class are moist, and therefore the reference to possible required sections shall also apply here.
drivers should be especially careful in the less frequent roads in the area of Bohemian forest.
District Olomouc
With Schtagach, drivers today have to expect to go towards the heights in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of freight vehicles, Schtagenatsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow-driving forced the street championships to be used, in the Šumperk circle, according to street management information, about 3 cm new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the railways are mostly unlimited.
"In the circle of Šumperk remains in the heights still the snowest.
At the passport Červenohorské sedlo the drivers have to expect towards Jeseník with Schtagenatsch," said a street manager Šumperk today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the Jesenik circle also had to go out in the night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimitedly transportable, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers must be carefully driving in forest sections, since the railways are still moist.
Ústí nad Labem County of Liberec
In Northern Bohmen, the roadmasters report a number of badly transportable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smooth, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the circle of Ustí n.K. according to traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper layers below zero, so snow and ice will be kept on the streets. From the depths, especially southeast of the Bohemian Mediterranean mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported until now.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - day-to-day rain and melting snow, in the night of cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes and from the road I/13 at the border of the district Ústí n.L. and Liberec, bad transport conditions are reported.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to axes that were pressed from the snow load to the railway.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think of taking place in less than a month of world decay?
This is one of the disaster reports that we so much like to jump to people.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're rather funny about it and say that we are the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world’s fall.
In December you will also realise a unique project with three concerts against the world’s fall.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a country-wide beneficiary event that we have planned for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be at about the time that ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us, the Maya calendar.
Whose is this idea from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphicsman Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect sufficiently positive energy to prevent the world's decline, but we also want to think together with the public about the condition in which we once surrender this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world’s fall, with which the people can also support us.
The Band The Tap Tap Tap, together with other artists, has also recorded the sog. Hymne against the World Down with the title "World Decline falls out".
Already today, the hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also come to the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, all the way to the end, provided that everything works and the world's fall doesn't take place...
The hymne is intended to be sung by all artists on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted lively in a direct switch from the Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sing with...
How did you get to collaboration with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech Culture scene, which is related to the realization of many beneficiary events and concerts...
We're trying to intensify these people in our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in collaboration and have fun.
What is the purpose of the remuneration of the concerts against the decline of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier free education centre Studeo, where we have been working six years with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly assisted by teachers who help them with different recreational activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, it is intended to create a own building in which we then move into with this project.
Several groups and artists appear at each concert.
What criteria did you choose these?
We wanted to put together a program that all generations, including children, are addressed to.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Syký.
More information is available on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we are presenting at Prague spring for the first time, and we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year, we would like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would like to link this to events in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizing?
It's not as bad as it appears at the first look.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, of course, we have to drag many instrument bags and other baggage...
Nevertheless, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us to have sometime wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison of how it looks with accessibility in each country, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you ever experienced these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities in which everything works better than with us, we were witnesses in Russia that in the east is everything still in its beginnings.
Toward Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is traveling in the city centre alone.
It is not even obvious there that you leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations there who are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respects do we have to collect toward the further developed countries?
There's a lot more things we're hanging after...
However, it is noted that improving the situation depends always on the efforts of the subjects.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not very usual that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead with the Band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranges, things will really begin to change.
To date, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to create a band?
At that time I began as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I am a musician myself, including Saxofon, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, as our moderner, Lá'a Angelovič, used to say, it happened something out of control (laughs).
But the band was known only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that collaboration with known singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for us.
We have become aware that, if you do something and do not see it outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funding funds, we can also afford good lectors, high-quality devices and others.
Was it your goal to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the show business today often copies one another.
This is logical in his way, since everything new is considered with caution and only after a long time is accepted.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
The first impression most of the viewer is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely excessive because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it helpful for this success also that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also require a certain discipline.
This is, however, quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have samples twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases, and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm will quickly end with many.
This is how it works everywhere, in every band who wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, that is, since 1998?
Only one: Láěa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join is always welcome to us.
Does take place on the day before the forecasted world decline, Thursday 20/12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three places of events are finally connected by live standing and there is a joint interpretation of the hymne "World Downfall falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide funds for the creation of a multifunctional disabled education centre, which is to be created under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA, Poland became the twentieth member of this Space Authority. Poland is thus the second Member State from the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The road of Poland into the space was probably beginning much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasms were engaged in space, not always on understanding.
I remember, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warschauer Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 the Prix REP-Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defense of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognised contribution to the development of space was among other things appreciated by the name of one of the craters on the earthly side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway droisine was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It has not even been clarified whether the missile should be used to start or to brake the draisine.
The information on this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missiles.
The research was conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents provided show that research had been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the entry of the German Army.
In 1937, in the special press of the design of a photoelectric hunting dragon from Ing. Rohoziński appeared, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" published by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects focused on the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of missile technology were coordinated by the transient Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Comité Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of an space society.
At the time there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was not expected that the research of the space would have the future.
In 1956, the Polish Space Society tried to join the International Federation for Space in 1951, and the PTA became an ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-President of the International Federation for Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA took a major part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests started with the two-level RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighted about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the Rakete RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe high winds.
In 1962, however, further developments were stopped.
Follower of the first rocket of type RM was the meteor-1 rocket developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-level missile, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, different from the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket has a transport room of 0.4 litres of capacity, meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the meteor 2 missiles were developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg use load to a height of approximately 60 km.
Afterwards, the versions of meteor-2H and meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Republic of Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on public work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on publicly useful work.
This decision led to a vivid discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem once from a wider perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with free financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (loans) there are price tensions.
It is understood that a condition of which the manufacturer is attempting to consist in economic competition by importing favourable goods, by "incurring competition" in order to increase its market share and increase its profit.
In a large scale, this means that most companies move their production to abroad or buy them in favour, or leave their business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with similar high labour costs.
Since private capital does not have a social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further strengthened by the absolutely unwilling entrepreneurs to pay their taxes and thereby replace the total economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are excessive at this point.
The unrespected practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own people with private capital without considering the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital in particular in the field of wages.
This is done by economic force in the case of long-term unemployment, and by circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
For a few years in Germany, there have been public food agencies for arms who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of subjects already goes into the millions.
As part of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase their income until the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The spare measures will undoubtedly go beyond the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century) under the pressure of a disaster of their social level (as in the 19th century), or to serve for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hopeing that private investment capital will be flown into the country at any time.
Here, naturally, is the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty is wandering from one country to another; or capital remains in the same way, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, employees are working for a fraction of European wages at all.
This concerns Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State must not participate in its own economy with capital and that the planning economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is closely maintaining its view that the State is not allowed to intervene in the economy.
But then you have to wonder whether private capital does not affect policy and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense or even affects it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically almighty and present lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual distribution, legislation, in which practically everything is fragile but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a State Ministry is responsible for a lack of finance, private, close to industry, with the development of legislative drafts.
These draft laws will then be adopted on the Bundestag.
All violence is then no longer a result of the people, as the Western Constitutions proclaim, but of strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are now quickly encountered in a situation as they described Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesar and Pompeius' time: "The state has long been understood in destruction, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against smear money, by illegal ease of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew uninhibited, and the people went to election with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not combat for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "The one really began to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with sole rule.
As it appears, today’s society, as well as in the ancient, is based on the unrespectless preference of its own advantage, without taking care of social interests.
The private capital has not been able to recognize and implement the benefits of the whole society from its nature.
The result, like today, is an unprecedented decade of elites, who do not in the least work for deep reforms.
We must therefore seek the cause of fascism and communism in the unrespected liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's perspective, the fall of this regime in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, where the next round is already in place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites are faced with the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human life, humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know from older and newer history, in perfect ignorance.
The abolition of the law on public work is not a solution here, at least no permanent.
Under pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopolisation of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: laboratory of the chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or ever could occur" says Sting in Song Fragile, whose most important verse in the Refrain is, "...so that we don't forget how broken we are."
"If my sons didn't want to war, there wouldn't be any," said the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, there was a number of reactions.
The one stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while denoting the Palestinians as terrorists; the other support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel as terrorists.
I do not want to write about who is born in this ever-recurrent wave of killing and who is victims; eventually, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-administration areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about opening the readers the view behind the scenes, the view of whose 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) are especially suitable in the small spot country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these, and from my own understanding of who or which group of people is significantly affecting the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the fight for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less evident is the question whether it were really always those personalities themselves who set their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne someone was directing their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is focused on less individuals, and that this concentration of money and its resulting power have not developed within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, a special emerging that could be called the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone is above them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
A lot is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already bought by the Rothschilds in the nineties of the 19th century to interfere with the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in the background of which the strengthening of their power, the increase of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in nearly all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they conduct wars or rest on them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis, only four remained, while Russia in the meantime subjected its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, started during the Civil War Publishing own (speak: state) banknotes and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to release its own banknotes and wanted to eliminate the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to accuse the FED for the trigger of the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global power noise of the Rothschilds led to the formation of a plan for the defeat of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free wall of 33, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the large monarchist states of Europe, in particular the second war should break the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war is intended to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a such number would provide their comforts and luxury and would not also consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is here nothing more than the premise) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crises such as those caused by them in 1907 are not repeated).
After the murder of Habsburger throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Zar Reich by the revolution of the Bolshews.
The first World War ended with the sudden, military and economicly unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarian Empire, the war was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the banks allowed the politics to create a late conflict situation by laying down Germany with giant war repairs, thus creating the prerequisite of poorer masses, so that they had to undermine the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader who offered the debts designated and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take into account the function of a fifth column, and also took into account to unlock the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, where a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; the first conflicts with the inhabited Arab population came.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was released from the chain where the international bankers held him at the beginning, or whether everything went by plan, is hard to estimate, at least the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state through the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war repairs against Germany to the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed in defeating this war, the Jewish people will be a victim in the front line, this time with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, as in the Second World War.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the land itself, but also internationally (which is just thought of how sharply people were divided into adherents and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers in an endless spiral of violence, at first the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are exclusively electing their own candidates.
The present Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism attacked politician who is loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything in order to open up a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghaier Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and in which, because of Iran's control, it could come to a destruction of the world economy over the only two miles wide road of Hormus, which runs over 20% of the world's death infarctions.
In what light do the words of David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a cruel crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the young and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all to give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, but he has the painting, name of the animal or number of his name.
Here is wisdom. Whoever has understanding, he will consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US American message in Teheran and took 52 diplomates as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fleeed after the revolution to the United States, who had preserved the cartridge over his regime for decades.
For the U.S. government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shake overboard, since this would have damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to implement the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution was made up in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe struggle for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasko in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made everything worse.
After 444 days of negotiations by the Algerian Government, the diplomats taken were finally released.
The fate of the hostages at home proclaimed a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran moods.
The Debakel in Iran contributed considerably to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in 1980 to the presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actress Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six messengers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they were warned to travel with Canadian passports as members of a film board that was supposed to visit Drehorte in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywoods.
In order to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in special magazines, press conferences were held, and the fiktive production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several types of films.
On the one hand, he is a realistic polytril, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful housepiece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the atmosphere in the film - on one side the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in filming of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which therefore come ironically and easily overspot.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office flours, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has successfully restarted his career with this film.
From a embarrassed actor, he has become a respectable director, and he is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third playfilm after the Krimi No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Afflecks' first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the previous films of this director took off from the standard Hollywoods.
Affleck, however, demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Teheran is "played" from Canada.
The best scenes of the film are playing in the streets and showing the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the incoming sequence of the contamination of the message is very impressive in their perspective, and yet gives the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect also achieves Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the false film stack on a base in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to consider that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the filmic sense.
But with the few he works quite successful, sometimes helping the reality - which then does not always work so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Teheran is turned off by a telephone in America, or also the persecution hunting on the startway, seem something like it).
The weakness of Argo is its all too widespread spread, which is due to the need to show too much on action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are far not alone in the movie.
Afflecks film thus loses some of the train power. It is a film that you can follow with some interest and govern the design and the retro style that reminds a thriller of the 70 years.
However, he makes it hard to raise enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a living piece of history and as evidence of how far the ideas of the almighty and all-knowledging secret services are, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for the explosion of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who annually proclaims an inquiry on the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to organize competition "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organisation of this survey, compared to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the European Court's judgment on the uniformisation of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible incidences from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual voting will then take place by the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations include the binding immixation of bioethanol on fuels which are naturally harmful, and also the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer only because it contains a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the Directive on the size of chicken boilers, which became significantly expensive in this year.
In the past, criticism also harvested the factual prohibition of the use of the term "slash of food" or also the prohibition of sales for traditional glue bears.
Banans must be 14 cm long
The EU Apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are generally represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (that is why Czech Republic is currently trying to implement the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby Interests also stated that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and do not have "crumbling anomalia".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it only harmonizes the unanimous national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to waste food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation of last year, which, according to airballons, has to be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age should not blow up the balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU called on an American study which, according to airballons, is the leading cause of children’s nutrition.
Similar restrictions already apply to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual markets.
There are couriose attacks at home too
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - everyone who exercises an official function in the EU - must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Formal Yugoslavia of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server also nominated the EU Regulation on the extent of food stocks in the field of a Member State in collaboration with liberal Economist Laissez Faire.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks allowed on the day of our EU accession to the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for sulphur preserves, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organisations of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or of the idea of granting funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were obviously not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for refund in the EU," explained the Agricultural Minister for Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest had been very high and that the state camps had been overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, we should be paid hundreds of millions of euros according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission met Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that have no access to the sea.
Funds for funding applications offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically should be funds for the establishment of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exceptions
However, regulations in the Member States are easily deserving the objective of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts believe.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions in this country also emphasize the fact that Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké thaaržky", the domestic space (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition reaches back with us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemák".
The name "Room" may only be used for products of sugar tube destillate, not for sugar beet products.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU, the world-famous cheese feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmaschinken are now showing up the Karlsbader Zwieback, carps from Pohořelice and Třebo, or also the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU brand, the Pardubicer can breast up or the Hořicer rolls.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how is the idea of candidateing for the President's office?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I wouldn't be candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are increasing taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to be politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40 years old, independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than to candidate for the office of a senator or the President.
In the Senate you made it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I told myself all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later I clarified this and said that if I was elected to be a senator, I would be candidate for the President's office.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is a tool that I can realise my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strongest mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that as a people we squeeze in the trap and in front of the TV, but let anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob one's honor and that are to confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed to buy journalists or to be a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle you have taken with the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive asset statements over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you have to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked for the traveller to remain a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the small spirit policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without drawers and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a human in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I think the people see me rather left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
It is not about whether anyone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it if someone calls you a popularist.
But don't you confirm this by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
This can be referred to as popularism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without any support in Parliament, you will only keep the words of the words.
And that is what you do not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to the people long enough, will it succeed, for example, to carry out material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to put them on our side to implement these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the Presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the respondents would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to misery can exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct choice of the President, who was a deserve of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and have tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
It sounds like Okamura should save Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I am not reaching anything alone; therefore I have spoken with several known personalities about whether they do not want to candidate for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who rejected for work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in the trade in light heat oil.
My candidateship began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not at all come to the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the Establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district heads.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I have not yet thought about this because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member and have not even the money for it.
I don't even have money for the president's campaign; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about a million, and then I have a few million on the account.
Aston Martin was, by the way, a childhood dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You're driving an aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program is not too interesting.
And I am not obliged to fight the campaign with my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live from the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be annoying for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your performance?
Didn't you say you're going back to these activities?
But this is not related to the height of the salary.
As promised, I partly retired my activities.
For example, in the spring, my alternate member becomes the director of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something, too.
What month's income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still true.
As President, however, I would put my business to my full.
You can find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of spikes and the recently built Bookberg - 2 photos
"I like the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "But, it's beautiful already, the house."
But I wonder what we need to do today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man goes to one of these old-style libraries today, isn't it?
Spikes, a hardly invisible sleeping town in front of Rotterdam's gates, is an extraordinary record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants of the Netherlands have the lowest educational rate.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general formation and to rebuild the seven fictive bridges presented on the euro bills as beautifully pinned steel concrete thumbnails.
The success of the educational offensive remained in limits.
And so the urban fathers realized that there was only one way to become statistics master: a library must be here!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, Master of the toll-cool bar charts and producer of funny, even often cynic buildings, took the matter with common quietness and appeared to competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury still looked fortified around and sucked with the axles, the frightened Maas stabbed his exposed medal of size to a pyramid and ended his actionistly understood speech with the words: "Dear town community!"
So this is him, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkennisse, for the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later the 30 million euro expensive mountain was shattered.
It is part of a re-vitalization project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and series houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the bookberg was awarded with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small town retorts, which had no longer to offer to date than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an inconsistently terrible courthouse, behind which white facades would be tended to suspect a molkery factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, spikes now have the first public culture building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheeseeglocks.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain massive, the true space and reading delights occur at the footing climb of the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and transparent, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public city place.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already keep looking for park bank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Usually the books are standing along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and inappropriate," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on our head and swallowed the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the Bookberg is well used: In the middle, offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special joy are the black books forests, which are once wall clothing, once rearing, sometimes steing lands.
Optics, hoaptics and smells are strangers.
Even infected architects and construction engineers shake their heads if the unknown material is unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the town community of Spijkenissen, on request of the standard.
And so, in a freeland farm, we have one day found a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter thin plastic is used as a root base in the Netherlands in growing houses and on fields.
This is cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's ripe for the locker.
For the library, the Vlies - for the first time in this quantity - was pressed to four centimeters of thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit of a new car and a bit of a sports shoe.
After 105 stages, you arrived at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meter long hike, the literature café is rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crokets and baptized ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Contributions to the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but, despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a pre-viewing project in punkto ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and chilled with earth heat.
Although the Bookberg is under a glass crash, the sun itself appears only shortly in the interior on sunny days.
The broad wooden limb bonds, which stand across to the glass phase, serve as a shade and take a large part of the sun ray.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest do full automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic of the IT industry, was already vouching the way to the new booklet.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM Teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even denotes the Bookenberg as the "last overdue soul" of the bookenberg.
The reason: To open up a few weeks ago, each inhabitant was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This is intended to fill first the optical gaps in the not yet fully covered library - currently 70,000 pieces -.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the decoration.
This has succeeded in the MVRDV of the king's discipline, which is referred to in the jargon Identity Foundation.
Spijkennisse have written literature history.
As young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach for identity.
Szabo: "German must play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the adoption of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US relations, Berlin balances in a smal diplomatic degree.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for a observer status of Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin contained himself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be careful because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical to Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the voice when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by the NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position in important international topics?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it just transforms its foreign policy, and it disappears from a policy that, as it were, managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to add that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still moving to their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean, then specifically from a German perspective?
It shows the willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States or European partners in national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the attitude in the conflict and voting in the United Nations?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to kick the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
Well, that's a matter of course.
But I wouldn't want to add too much weight to it either, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important votes, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was a dramatic fraction, as in the Libya question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it is being taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly spoken for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama in secret has quite much understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences in opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so brightly enthusiastic with Netanjahus politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see himself in the role of an important international player - will Germany anyway take on a major role?
Or does Germany still find the role of leadership difficult?
Germany is not used to that, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Eurocrisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European politics continues to decline, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if it doesn't like them, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much unfavourable - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
Thereafter, a very officially registered name in China is hidden, but it does not have to deal with the originating companies.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual namegivers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the Kanzlei Taylor Wessing, specialized in protective infringements in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The followers already have a few additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
This is how Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-Kny be registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company allowed to protect the trademark Segna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Segna.
The fact that the Chinese world masters are in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multiple shopping houses that sell almost exclusively counterfeitings.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he is in favour of the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a accompanying brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who lay rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered, the sole setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial deficit and process costs of the sectors concerned are the millions, especially in the case of expensive pre-visory products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest luxury market and the fastest growing.
But deletion of dubios entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move, with uncertain end.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration of the claimed name became "market-treality".
If the complainant has a problem, he even needs to pay money to the Plagiator because he hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle exists here.
Familiar cases also affect graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, which recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Thus, the Chinese may use a symbol that is similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the struggle was highlighted, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore, which led the famous crocodile to look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there has been plaques there in 2010 because of low staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, you have returned from the "noise situation in the course of work to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed objections had decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 objections are still awaiting in the Office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth time on each other lists of new applications in the world, the Authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan was charged.
Simplified, this means that each application costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, the case of the German family company Freudenberg costs a lot.
For more than seven years the group has fought against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated vehicle parts was eliminated.
However, the follower continued to secure Chinese rights at the brand Freudenberg.
It has been neglected, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trade mark rejected the contradiction of the Muniches.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the process continues to fight until today.
You need to watch out for the hell.
The matter is now adhered to the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly counted, the company archive had even to review a hundred years old documents in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg on the other side in vain offered a "high six-digit euro amount" to be added.
"It's how much this is worth us," Wentzler says.
The dangers in Fernost even threaten to return to Europe.
Then, if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long left the group, yet he was able to stop registering.
"You have to watch out," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It was not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but, as Wentzler says, the foreigners should "notify anything that is somewhat protective, even in China".
Otherwise it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to his last act of trademark drama, then you probably have to pay the other side license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the relevant segment.
World Aid Day: Stamps, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir imbongi - and Swaziland are delighted by AIDS-whales.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, the stumping is cowboystiefel, basketball shoes, lady pumps and Lord's Lipper looking for the tachy on the parket floor, finding it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then first, the voices of the singers slowly swell at - old, bass, tenor and sopran - press, beat and persecute themselves.
And Fiet Hopf, the 29-year-old dirigent, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his shameful wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi proofs a new song.
The fifty singers have come from 23 to 69 years old, from the human genetics to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice has a different text and it is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people around the world, which appreciates unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS babies live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa has found patents in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take over a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The Bantu language fluently speaks can no one in this room, but sing.
For nearly ten years, the choir has practiced songs in this foreign soft language and brings them off and back to where they originally come from: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 km from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, depending on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple sleeves and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have been imposed on the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, it appears in the smallest place where the whole Swaziland is sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Crops of male prehuid, which prove to reduce the risk of inflammation by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in itself to die with mid-30 is no rareness.
At a common African journey in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the imbongis saw many children on the streets, which were not only lacking of parental care, but simply at all: food, clothing, education.
Without school graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him to eat a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Association of "Voices for Africa", who has been looking almost professionally for the AIDS-Waisen in Esitjeni since then.
Facts of sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmittable diseases?
The bacterial STI includes Syphilis, Chlamydiene and Tripper (Gonorrhe).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappilomavir, herpes genitalism or hepatitis.
Filzläuses and scratches are part of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chlamydiene infections, trichomonads, candidose, trippers and human pappilomavirs are frequently sexually transmittable diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet, about 20 percent of HIV new infections occur on this group.
Chlamydiene infections occur far more frequently among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In these countries human pappilomavirs are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmittable diseases are reportable.
The number of Syphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, has doubled more than 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases may cause genital ulcers, urinary disorders, flushing, abdominal pain as well as bladder or waxes.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of inflammation but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
For partly, infections of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by smear infections and close contact with the body.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be healed and avoided late consequences.
Through patents, donations, and not least the gages that the choir sings throughout Germany, there are a lot of things together.
"Totally we have already sent around 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and violent woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans come well, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as called the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 infants with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms each day in time to school.
Whoever has no more comes to the safe house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as the two chicks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a school for nailing, built two chicken houses and organised together with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not natural, because, as obviously the disease is throughout the country, it is the most preferable to be silent dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually, strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sancted form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers carrying the virus through the land.
Free condoms would be at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels together every two or three years through the south of Africa and sings songs full of sorrow, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many still know at the southern peak of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has also been caught a few tears from some cruel border soldiers.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patent children.
Even if you find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the test room at the Bergheimer Straße, you see it lighting there too.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Merkur
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although it is next to the sun, there are also frozen water there, as shown in three studies published on Thursday in the Scientific magazine.
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently lying region of the planet.
This is intended to be at least 30 cm and may even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are impressed on the Mercury.
No one brings the found of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger sound, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Merkur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings could help clarify how water and other building stones of life arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, sons, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of the world's universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to earth: Little gooses into infinite wides.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who crawls behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres is no "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of unnumbered star generations: the oldest stars are recognized as blue points, the pink-colored "newborn" are more difficult to identify in the star circle hall.
This constellation region - by scientists called unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star picture Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shilling glut of a dying star has taken the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slew out in the death process.
In the huge trifid nebula, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birthroom.
The Plejaden Star Hope, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the only eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better accessible.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebule looks to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star picture.
His similarity with an earthly continent brought this fog the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how these have been created is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon, which disappeared 2.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on colouring, recordings of spiral galaxies become real artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light years away Trifid Nebel in the star image Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three parts), as dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birth place three parts.
Astronomers have photographed the premises of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiral Galaxy M83.
If technical abbreviations are not available, it may be called with her nickname Southern Firecycle.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a cut from the irisnebel in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this star novel is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star wave always produces new youngsters.
Also these stars clouds, connected with the rosett nebula, produce ongoing new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was only created just shortly after the first knall when it was mainly in the universe to be found hydrogen.
Our insights in the All: The most important telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galileo set it in for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become increasingly larger - and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the Palomar Observatorium near San Diego was the world's largest remote tube.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Great Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows looks into the All just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescope Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10,4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Yet he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is attached to its height angle - and thus limited in its movement.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality: the high light collective power.
This, in spite of the relatively small mirror diameter, reaches the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to all for foreign signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing calculating performance.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the fern tube can also light the average infrared spectrum.
Similarly, the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned at the ESO Observatorium in Chile.
Its main level is to cover 42 meters - and composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the latest in 2018.
By 2007, the two ceck telescopes on the Hawaiian Vulcan Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equally two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatorium, which still looks into heaven with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be amazed on a illustration.
However, the main impressions from the All provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already delivered pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been looking for extra solar planets - mainly for those who are inhabitants.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the latest start-up preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board of an Ariane5 rocket at the first time in 2018.
The primary level of the space infrarotelescoop has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is supposed to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urchal.
Scientists assume that there is also the South Pole of Merkur Ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messengers cries far closer to the North Pole around the planets.
Radar measurements have been indicating for decades that there is ice on the Merkur.
Through the Messenger Sond launched in 2004 - the first to crawl around the Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink daily butter - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblely high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparablely young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblely high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparablely young.
The journey through the Talysch mountains is called wilddromantic.
The small bus runs over the curved road, passing closely forested hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and soft, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here the Caucasian group of the Talys lives, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very long-lasting.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town prospers with too vigilantly radiated architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too queer is the arrival of the capital of Azerbaijan Baku.
For the 323 kilometres, you need eight hours because the road is only busy.
The sophisticated wealth that the country is due to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented from about eight dozen talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
A child still grown at the age of 136
However, the controversial star of the museum is the sheephirte Şirali Musslümov, which is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth document.
And in view of the oldest documented people who became 122 years old, Müsslümov's age seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he was supposed to have had a daughter.
So did Irali Müslümov get away with his age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, agency researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-aged people in Central Asia.
"There are outstanding many high-aged people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz says, "also in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
However, because of the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age should be given, especially because the register of personal status is missing.
Every day, beechly mixed butter
The fact is, however, that the people around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why live here in the south so many high-aged people?
The Azerian traveller Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
On the other hand, Museal Director Fatulayeva believes that it is food.
But that the calorie-rich diet of the talys should be so healthy, that the meat, bread, and especially milk products, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not appear plausible from a dietary perspective.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemaran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole Kaukasus region.
She's sitting on the ground with a butterflies that she's rolling up and down.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are long-term grandparents.
Two grandchildren are jumping around.
In the kitchen, the guests are prepared tea, which is served in the typical, built-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfect in rice and joints, under her head towel she hides long, dark-blown teeth that are proudly revealing her son before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough for life
She always eated only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
For all my life, I haven't bought food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the time after the Second World War.
But everything became better than the "loved Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rod.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father character of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, has little boundaries in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the roder.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, a amount of which you can live well for these conditions.
And maybe Mirzayevas also has long been awesome son right: "The old ones enjoy high-respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word 'human rights' is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising advertising in Cairo reveals the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with the Sharia as the base is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to create the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the public.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but most likely to the Christian cups, the liberal, informed Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly disputed in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of graces of powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, temporarily cut the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competences to "saving the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral title of the American University of South California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are about it, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judicative be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles that were undergoed by the Islamistly dominated 100-headed Constitutional Assembly are partially encouraging in a nightly, 15-hour parforceritt.
As in previous constitutions, the draft is based on the principles of Islamic law.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is the matter of interpretation and it is fearful that the Islamists will use the swimming formulation and the corresponding legal space for a more strict interpretation of the scharia.
At least a newly added article: in all the matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation throughout the Sunitian Islam.
This must not be, but it can mean that the clergy supervises legislation, which would de facto have resulted in the dismissal of the judicial.
Much in the draft draft is interpretation matter
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress oppositionians.
After the dictator’s crash, up to 11,000 civilians were in military force.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "the true being of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and values".
This is so unclearly legally formulated that government institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the clear text, this means nothing but censur.
In addition, no article expressly states the equality of men and women.
Another forbids to offend or blaspheme the prophet Mohammed and his Messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it should be done, remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios advocates the formulation that "infringement of humans" is forbidden.
Is there enough a caricacy of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation as many things are presented in the draft Mursi for signature and, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the supremacy of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual entrance on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter to the fall before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Pricer and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the Constitutional Draft was "to the Wasteberg of History".
By means of a short news service Twitter, he accused the attendants of Mursis to want to lead a "push against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and fall him," said oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet reconciled," the Egyptian media quoted opposition policyer Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood remained on their part to the counter demonstration, but not to the Tahrir place, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer at the University of Cairo.
Many filled women and adherents of the Salafists took part in it and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi: "Surfers the land!" and said: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the Highness of the symbolic Tahrir place on which everything took its beginning would probably have brought up civil warlike conditions.
It was obvious that Mursis' followers did not want to risk this.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the constitutional draft and the advocates had expressed themselves loud and clearly.
Now be the time to let the people decide the way the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because it is indispensable to him for human rights.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complains in his conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state let the lawyer resign.
These measures are violent violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"In place of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts it out of force," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels alone, including by the international community, who considers the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "You bear a monster that you can't control any more."
Racfish from Norway: Is that the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with local appetite on pretty badly smelling fish?
You take a selection of overwhelming cheese types.
They are placed in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothes.
And give them a week there.
Approximately, you have to imagine the nasal smell of railfish, one of the great delicates in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this harsh smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Racfish is salted forelle, which - depending on how dazzling one wants - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the land in Norway and the weather becomes colder, Norways are streaming to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, truly very bestying speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halfarsen, who actually works in the local fireguard, but as so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organizes the festival.
All around us people eat small fish baskets and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the railfish," said Havard.
The spiritus can suppress the smell.
I'll cost a few cups.
If you avoid taking the railfish into the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a rather long bus ride behind you.
Racfish is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were no cooling options and fish was drowned in air-tight salt water vessels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and devoured with alcohol.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and mainly wandered into the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who were far more rich than Norway, stream immigrants.
Racfish is regarded as something important - as a vital, although strictly fragranced part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive courts you can buy here.
But actually here is everything expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich cost proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often get into the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here you still hate to name Anders Breivik - those racist judicial extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, you refer only to the "event of July 22".
Norwegians are difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our sergeant, who distributes round tablets with mature railfish and represents the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the steaking blue eyes.
We are a cautious people, as you say.
Their English is just like that of most people here flawless.
We're not very profound, we don't like bullshit.
Norway has handled its oil riches very carefully - a large part of the industry yields are invested in a special fund for future generations.
When, in the years up to the world economic crisis, all of them were thrown around with money that they did not own, Norway kept its stock exchanges firmly closed.
"As long as we can drive ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat railfish," she adds with a laughless laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and standing for another court - of Rakfish I've got enough.
It's not the same thing as an elephant citizen, but the soft meat is gonna make me feel.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is back on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log is one of several events places that organize a railfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the smell mind most challenging - fish.
There is a live-TV showing to a flyed showmaster surrounded by plates with railfish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're laughing and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict darkness of all the fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his official accession, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the upcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days this is a constantly blocked city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important roads to the capital and carries chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bonds and take over the leadership of the nation.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the separate government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is in the hands of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the Oval Office to the U.S. President of Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that enables us to achieve this objective.
Before he joined the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this dense, largely inhabited part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions on the new Head of State are divided.
An Direct Man
For example, in the distant small town of Valle del Bravo, you like to remember him.
Inhabitants of the vacation site award to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement to the broken, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plakets with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," says his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as congress agency for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
In particular, what the security and the economy concerns, we are hoping for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Assembly Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party is making great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations of the opposition, which the new President lacks of substance, he refuses.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but especially he is also a listener.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, contrast to the patched streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are of decisive urban nature.
Early this year the military was launched to combat the drug bands operating in the fourths, and violence against women is a particularly urgent problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large waste deposit, the bodies of thousands of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the period of office of governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is famous for her violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed their eyes from the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the downcoming quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her lifemate.
"When I came home to her, it seemed like her body washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is appropriate next to a cross that has a single word: justice.
But just these, like the family, have been denied.
The authorities have treated me as being a sweater, annoyer, narrower.
They want you to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth.
"But that is not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been embarrassed over the last six years by violence crimes, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem especially during his term of office.
"I hope that as president he is the way he was governor," says the PRI Congress Officer Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor contradicts Bradley Mannings' claims that he was mistreated in prison.
The hearing deals with Mannings' time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh imprisonment conditions
The liberary of the U.S. Army is condemned to have used thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused for the largest enthusiasm of confidential information in the American history - missed several occasions to complain about the mistreatment he claimed to have suffered in the military.
In a cross-interrogation of Mannings during a prejudice in Ft. Meade, Maryland, May. Ashden Fin declared that documents for weekly visits that the prison officials had done during the nine months of arrest in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the interrogation, which was held as a result of an application for defense for rejection of the charge - Manning had already been enough punished by the hard arrest period - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analyzer of the US Army arrested in June 2010 is defeated to have stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq during his service period.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fin with Manning carried out the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his prison in the quantico military prison, where he had suspended under enhanced prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints about abuse, although the officials Manning had consulted directly on his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and stated that they should deal with them, but they were not logged.
"They wrote (after the discussion of concerns) "No problems" and that didn't necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 who was to examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status for "prevention of injuries".
The military stated that it has assigned him this restrictive status - which is a stage under the risk of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and moved to Kuwait, where he was arrested nearly two months before being moved to the prison of the Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and once became unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world would have been a burden.
"My world shrinked together on camp Arafjon, on this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed a mattress, a ceiling, a flip flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or to lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that went from outside into his cell.
If he turned around at night and watchers couldn't see his face again, he was raised so that he turned back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about a accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at a morning counting.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this counting.
At the question on Friday, Manning announced that he had concluded from a order of his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had invited him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked in the last night. He had tried to show a official that he was not at risk for himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the covenant of his subshes or his flip flups to hurt himself but did not.
This night, Manning said, his subsets, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his arrest experiences and drasticly reduce his imprisonment, he should be convicted in his proceedings before the military court, which is appointed for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess a smaller crime for guilty, while other accusations that are considered to be too extreme should be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is held for this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains at its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners stored under the highest safety precautions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the beneficiary of the enemy, unlawful publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the steal of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened by life-long penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of chances
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them into memory difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when ignorance became wide in me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("extranjeros").
I was standing there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called Mexicans all my life.
A ethnic shortcut - just as my friends call themselves in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later I decided to be "mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for accelerations or binding lines.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not refer to the vocabulary of a parent speaker, and I am not going to get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for mexicans today remaining in Mexico with the same probability instead of migrating into the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block as a model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention details in this respect.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of refreshment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that in 1848 the United States fell into Mexico and forced the leadership of the country under the preserved gun to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not ignored.
As soon as a U.S. government official also exercises the most mild criticism of Mexico, there are complaints - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how the Americans urge the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
Yet, the biggest challenge in Mexico is true in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that one person – perhaps a parent or grandparent – had no chance in Mexico and emigrated north.
And in most cases, this person matched a profile - dark skiny, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we must never lose out of our eyes that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be diluted, but what our loyalty concerns is not the case.
This is clearly applicable to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership team do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a meal of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the side cover now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this badly to them.
While she is a US-American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither one nor another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to reopen their connections with Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "botsman" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on political leadership to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico six and a half centuries ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans are grieved for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" than I thought.
Old Fights, New Middle East
The arbitration between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation for peace
Can there ever be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to swell such a hope in the room.
In the midst of the ordinary debt allocations, countless buildings were placed in destruction and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were beaten.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly patent situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first view, optimism seems to be all other than appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the arms stop that was agreed on 21 November, these weekly fights have strengthened the hard-sicked ones on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has controlled the Gaza stripes since 2007, will be claimed to have reversed the Israeli, although its group had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza stroke are persecuted in one of the most desolate and tightest population corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas until now.
In fact, Hamas wins in the western country, which is controlled by the rivalising, temperate Palestinian group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a reinforced regional power once considered Israel's narrowest Muslim allies, has taken action for Hama's party - just like Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.
Joyful Hamas followers believe that Israel is a Islamic semi-mond - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels could stand before the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas bonds threatened to the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabitant and most important Arab country - at the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainablely.
Hosni Mubarak, the laisist despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with the Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could be an actress who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
On the other hand, the Israeli hardliners have a contrary conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas are no longer in danger.
The Israeli raket defence system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds its position indefinitely, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamine Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza strip have been killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide attacks - not least thanks to the locker railways that are run into the western land and thereby into the main part of a possible Palestinian state, but they keep protecting the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawful, but are continually expanded.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party joined the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even more fighting group.
Why do these disgusting Palestinians also hesitate and leave their own state?
If they really had control over the western land, wouldn't they, like their competitors in the Gaza strip, fire off rockets?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should dare lifting their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to go through, but the Arab spring could make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defence system of Israel is larger than its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi was associating with Barack Obama in order to reach a gun stop, could be a promiseful sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world takes considerable steps towards democracy, Palestinians continue to rob their self-determination rights - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression is now undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only intensify.
Blooding missions to repress Hamas in the Gaza region will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outer strap
The right answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states where Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future small - is that the resistance of arms will give external people more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt now, together with Turkey and Katar, has to stop arms deliveries in the Gaza branches and is better positioned than ever before to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by district exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to the move of Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he was also denied a participation.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging are in force
Health warnings and diseased parts of the body on neutral green packaging equal to all tobacco marks
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colors with neutral olive green ceiling, which are also printed with dramatic pictures, which are sick parts of the body, and which are shown by cigarette smoking infants and children.
From the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, printed in identical, small fonts, will be from the next Saturday.
In this way, Australia introduces the most strict rules for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamourous picture of tobacco consumption.
The government concludes from studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26 people will not start smoking with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply totobacco companies with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoke rates in the world and the changes will only have little impact on the profits of the multinational companies, other countries already consider similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It said that the laws would favour black market trade, which leads to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre by British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakes will offer far larger quantities of these products on Australia's streets.
Others, however, say that the laws have promoted their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette nets and silicone covers have increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan, tobacco were failing at the Upper Australian Court two months ago with their infringement of laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale shops and waited for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media lies with the precise population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, forbidden them to appear as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in business. Now the tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international pages.
"Who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has discovered an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself, is this just a private person who finds so much pleasant to Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to combat the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are dealing with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held discussions with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country that prescribed photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves despite.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You simply take a cup and hide the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the Tobacco Trade "King of the Pack" in the centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shelves.
"I had a hour before to order a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply have prohibited cigarettes completely - then we would have said OK, that was it, we're closing," he obviously adds upstairs.
In a constantly electricized world it's nice to be bored even once
I spent this thanksgiving in the airport in an unexpected five hours when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts boring.
I don't want to lie.
A half day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally free shopping) are available.
However, increasingly more academics and child development experts are boring as something positive.
If it goes after them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be sometimes bored.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring on one or other screen, the benefits of boring no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
As many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't think so.
"In fact, boring has a very long story," he says.
The walls of Pompejis set up a Latin grave fiti on boredom, which depends on the first century.
And then there's still the question how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, a associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boring has been defined and discussed in many kinds.
After long readings of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boring as the experience of "exercising a satisfactory activity but not able" can be defined.
Unfortunately, it differs from apathy as a result of the fact that the person is not busy but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no urgency to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, consists in a "interruption of the attention process, paired with bad silence and the feeling that time is only going slowly".
Pain can listen to it almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two situations could be related, people who are familiar see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we just have difficulties to concentrate.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - on German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boring under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the Fachzeitschrift "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment, listening to a band on which one person presented a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not even hear these noises.
Those who heard the hardly listening television claimed to feel more boring than the two other groups - they had problems with focusing, could not find any reason for them and gave their difficulties to bore.
If you try to focus on a difficult or struggling task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one exercises a one-tonic activity - "like the search for defective products on a factory support band, music can diminish and help not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that circuits and critics, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them, by keeping people more physically aware.
"Student studies have shown that children who are allowed to haunt, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get somehow bored - my late flight, a drunken loudspeaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are more boring than others.
In order to measure these differences, in the 1980s researchers developed a "scala to boredom".
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With such scales, researchers have found out that boys are more boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater diversity of external irritations.
But generally, teenagers are a pretty relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment where he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the adults were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% indicated that they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents claimed to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is being felt particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my question of origin: Is boring healthy?
Sometimes not, because in the extreme case, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling out of gambling or drugs to relieve them - this has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, who has researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boring, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can provide lucky feelings on the short run, but they refuge on the long run.
So whosoever is enough to have an iPad, it can bring it away from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transferring from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain himself but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should be boring.
We should also not see them too critical.
Rather, our goal should be to feel well from the continuation of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring," he says, "but boring is the painful, inevitable desire to do something meaningful."
He believes that people are just looking for one way, shutting down and relaxing in truth.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is hard to work when the noise is disturbed."
In Colorado there is no clear guide for the new Marihuana Law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the southeast of Colorados, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marihuana chunks and a pepper he smoked it with.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drug equipment - cavalry decrees, each with a $100 punishment - and received a trial date.
"We are treated as criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marihuana for use in its own use, the answer in hundreds of smaller drug crimes depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer pursuing adults over 21 years of age for possession in a small amount, which is allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced that they should continue to pursue existing marijuana crimes and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the towns of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what next will happen," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And governmental authorities in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for a guidance aid to establish a licensing system for the production, production, sale and sale of the drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case predicted to most of the states as regards marijuana regulation. There the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then legalised for own consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve in the sense of a gross guide.
"We have no real precidency that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December, thus also forming the end point of a grey zone in which, although the state license system is not yet available, the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practice issues must be clarified in this time - such as the state's standard of "required access" to licensed marihuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops in the area of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis shop than in urban areas, especially in the balling area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker of the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently educated research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail in which he declared that the prosecutor would no longer persecute smaller marijuana crimes in persons over 21 years of age and that the police would "from now" seek no criminal reports for this crime.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban regulations for farmers of medical marihuana and will continue to persecute drug dealers.
In Veld County in the north of Colorados, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to persecute cases of marijuana ownership, mainly in order to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people have to be responsible for possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana in court, although many have also been accused of other delicates.
"Our authority has the duty to persecute infringements that were infringements at the time of crime," Buck stated in an explanation.
The reactions are even in places like the Mesa County, where choosers rejected the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the country circle, no longer shows adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all outstanding ownership procedures fall.
"I don't think I waste my time using the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree to the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state promoted a huge dividing column among local officials in view of the large green experiment to day.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the prosecutor of marijuana crime before the court and acts on site as speaker for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"You have spent such a large part of their life in persecuting people for criminal law that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states that treat smaller amounts of marihuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are acted as national pattern cases for the legalisation of drugs.
While preachers and officials are preparing for a age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marihuana as a crime at the federal level.
Proclaimers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several exciting arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuanas, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor of the Obama Government, is of the opinion that, although criminal officials are probably not going to enter doors to beat smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be exposed to legal, state-regulated marihuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban that is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem on federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this change in law.
We are focusing on what the municipality has decided and not on what the State has decided for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students from today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought was the world's largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the large pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks of my entry at Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bag again and thus brought to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the evening standard it said I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that the communities in the neighboring room had sex.
The author A N Wilson explained slimly that I had left the university because I had been forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran, because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my pretty unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I was only shaken for one reason - a reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this claimed way of relief: My dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, current reports say that a new generation of students of tempered rights suffers similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred on Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded the same protection of equal rights that benefits homosexuals, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College say that they are often isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted because of their political views.
They are calling for a place in their College's Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an excentricist and Neonazis.
This was shown among other things by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a rolls royce and protected with silver-colored suit and silver-occupied herd.
Conservative students at other universities say they are considered to be "sond books for the introduction of higher study fees".
Luke Black, 20-year-old Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without ever getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she observed a growing rejection to students of tempered rights in JCR members.
"This is a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university had voted in favour of giving Margaret Thatcher, a former student, no credits because of shortages in the university.
The atmosphere would even have caused stalinists to be excited.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know themselves and the tutors, I received a taste of future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the spot of Tory students, but even with joy.
Political issues such as the mining worker strike, the privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the holched rooms of the Tutorial.
At my first events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been captured of what should then come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now died), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I was stumbling.
Pitt was a small man with a face like cooking tea, and quite cruel.
"Did thatcher adherents refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students cooked.
In my eyes, wearing tears.
"I suggest that you take some French hours in your leisure time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt mobbed me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I was at college alone at dinner when someone ticked me easily on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who imagined himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he friendlyly said.
Unfortunately, it's like it is.
Everyone who is suspected to be Tory will be pressed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory First Semesters pretend to be adherent to the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to imagine.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher in all matters.
This trick should prove to be without success.
A study beginner in the philosophy, politics and economy sector who ironically had visited the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How's Tories sex?" asked me.
They're hitting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet equals only after the invasion of the darkness?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years ahead of me, before my spiritual eye, stretched into a featherfire of a virginity and isolation.
The only tutor that was openly identified as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had consulted thatcher in matters of foreign policy and written talks to them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and smallerly and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he adopted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started to pendle between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more enclosed friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said little noise.
They would never do that, not in my city of dreaming tower tips.
Even my Communist friends always made good manners on the day.
His moist eyes were broken.
Give the whole a chance.
I'm sure they're just necking you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had given up the pressure and rejected his beliefs.
During a Tutorial in the next week, where another history student seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was shy in secret, I admitted that my parents had undergone me a "brain laundry" and called them "old fools".
The lightning took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the bag of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my hatches gave up.
When they left, I packed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a crying bitch.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and evilness in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hides behind a undeserved reputation of equal rights and freedom of mind until today.
"Valentino prefers elegance of famousness"
At the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemacher.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture have been compiled, created by his "maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinct clients.
Valentino has always experienced fascination for the sticky and remote world of the Adler.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will still be seen until 3 March, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most exciting aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest modemacher in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the noble must not be disadvantaged.
"They don't get out of their chickens on your glorious carpet as it does some beautiful fame from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-woman of "Heini" Thyssen, closely acquainted with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of famousness.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modemacher.
Many years ago, after a fashion view at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, they recognized and felt his influence.
"All the invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began their career at the week of Haute Couture in 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Modern view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of sensation, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleryes in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long course that suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walk to admire a dreamful "audiens" that wears the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kenneddy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather, belonging to the emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion pups, names such as Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a western type of "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection in 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," said Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex Herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and opinion leader at the fashion of Patricia della Govampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she was carrying a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990 ’ s, it ended.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin's castle, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a murdered upper part with a decolleté that makes his name honor.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not dependent on fashion, its possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocratine living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes of the modemacher "with absolute care," "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "König" of the fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modemacher called its closers) were necessary to make this ivory-bone silk dress with pearls, twelve different sticks and a four and a half meters long sweep.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honour alloy, Garavani cumulates as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I'm always his refined, his rest, his careful and perfect outermost noticed," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a Gala evening show in the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the grave Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was flawless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult job in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stoned roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to rise down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas from the earth is strengthened in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders through the tremendous paths of stone.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that rises up to a height of 2386 metres, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to rise in the shield rotation rate, keeping the balance and setting their steps carefully so that they do not rush out and crash.
They know that every step can cost her life, like this happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago at the slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur that they cut down.
Upwards, they run the road between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tired heavy baskets three kilometers to the weight, which a mining company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) its workers, paying 662 Indonesian Rupias (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) every day because this mineral is widespread and is used for the manufacture of wooden oils, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamites and even for bleaching sugar.
"Because we usually wear 70 kg, we receive some 46,000 rupias (3.8 euros) for each road, "Anto explains us, who usually makes three routes per day.
For each route, he takes three hours to complete it, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupias (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a clearly inhuman effort, but the threefold of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily pay of the mining workers here, where 15 000 rupias (1.2 euros) are paid on the day and the average monthly income is two million rupias (167 euros) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maurier on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupias (6,2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard as it was, but Anto was returning to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gas.
For three years, the 27-year-old Anto risks his life at Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are ripped out of the volcano because of the toxic gas.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-punished young man could work as a tourist leader, a soldier or a hotel reception, but instead he performs the work of a tragedy.
It divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the swab also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluely in the darkness.
The shadow challenges, he rises into the crater in the light of a small flashlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great gains, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur degradation to save costs, and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their own accounts and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive any share in the 30,000 rupias (2.5 euros) surcharge per photo device, which the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance money of 15 000 rupias (1.2 euros), require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protested Madrusin, a stiff 42-year-old carrier who has worked three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to wear up to 110 kg and assures that he continues, "for as long as it goes," because he needs the money for raising his three children aged 10 to 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes clap when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bladder on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with its 53 years of age is only able to wear 50 kg.
Each day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks through a goat path between the cheese to the camp in Tamansari in 18 km distance.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth far, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder works with his 30 years as a sulphur carrier.
The time passes, but the poorness of the generation holds up in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeians put the guilt for having no children, on the career, stress and the costs of the real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our citizens' obligation and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a advertising for Minzbons, but yet - or just that - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local words, such as "Shoes" become a "bao" (Laib) in the ovens to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising company, which turned the video, has the hope that the advertising spot will be achieved in a fun way to make the problem aware.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national obligation".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in the process of reproduction, so we realized that it was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of parfume with Pheromons or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why not make something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Who does not take this topic easy is the government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A package of the government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success until now.
Singapore is a rich, highly technological city state in south-east Asia, which is also known for the conservation of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeians get children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National People's Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "more career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have much more options in terms of life goals and priorities except for marrying and creating a family," she explains.
These changes in social situations have contributed to a higher number of individuals and to the excavators of marriage and births whose result is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a dramatic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentiments in the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the hardly disposed Xenophobie flows against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the Government Party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, taxes, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already affected the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales success.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual, and that they are shocking the construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoes bags" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold around days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This leads to them to be much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer orientations that previously have been imposed on obstacles when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could lead to an increase in national birth rates, the conversations with the Singapore people working in the financial district are not to be significant.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their career, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporeians have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can still do so much.
Offline Private is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "the area of private life where you have the right to protect from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he is exposed to when he declares situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five adolescents aged 10 to 15 years of age who are frequently on the network.
In four of the cases they linked the term to "something very own" at personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't advertise in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "privat" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has accounts for two years.
"This are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share any photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the fool," he says.
The boy is clear that it is wrong to publish obsolete photos, of necks, of crime, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
These include the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I entered Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'm just leaving it up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
He answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
"This does not scare me because we have something bad, for example music," he says.
After the boy was given, no one made him any comments or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone insists on me or demands it from me, I simply dismiss him from my user account" he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy's experiences that are known today as cyberbullying are not unknown.
The acquaintance of a girlfriend was expressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to set up a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's insympathic to me or I want to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with university graduation in education and learning, believes that to orient the children and youths, it needs to be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these sites, however, the rules have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and youths who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we ask them that they have a defined criterion on what is to be spread, published or said, and this in a age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective if it is most important for them to be popular, having thousands of friends, without meditating on the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that bring them to reflect on.
"To say they shouldn't do it," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like that you published by a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before labeling photos of celebrations?
And another question, must everyone know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online how they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Somebody outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the social networks directives carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish" he explains.
Guardia says that the children have to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Finalisation of the Summit of Unasur without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance and was to be theoretically signed by the seven present governments.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellor initially notified that they would be transferred after the clause, however, stated that it would be published on the Peruan government's website at a certain time.
In the case of questions about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room only the picture of the president meeting was transferred without sound with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information that circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments present at the meeting of Unasur, but not by the Peruan press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which led to the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media discomfort that demanded more information.
After that, the Presidential Office of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "closing Statement" of the Summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the IIIth Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the press’s strong call, the so-called Declaration of Lima, which was previously announced, was not even published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but in a great extent restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Court of Justice of the Hague, which lays down a cross-border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which starts on Monday in Den Haag, in the process that initiated Lima against Santiago to listen to the ployers on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are present to this International Court," said Humala along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, and remains a country that observes international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements, and undergos international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handprint before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subjected to the IGH took place after a decision by Colombia on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which felt it was a serious mistake, and had raised a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were attended.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after his president Fernando Lugo's detention, has not participated in the meeting.
The hosting president Ollanta Humala opened the conversations in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after the lunch.
The Head of State left the final document, which announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the action lines for 31 projects between South American countries were set over an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
Regarding the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the objective of a South American citizenship, to extend the decisions on residence rights."
He informed that measures would be driven forward to improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and organised transnational crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the case of natural disasters.
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) is not allowed to take triumphant moves, but is intended to extend our production performance and show our people a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the geographical relations in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and thus establish new economic forms," said the Peruan President in a read explanation.
Among these projects, five Peruans are located on the crossings of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participating in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
"I may meet with the President Daniel Ortega on Saturday tomorrow," said Santos.
"We will all check these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope that we will be able to say to the President Ortega that we will be treated as civilised and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the Summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, in which dialogue and consensus with regard to the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, whereby "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans were "killed in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "now are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already in the Andes Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reconstruction of the organization of American States (OEA) under the standard to reduce the influence of the angel Saxony states and to take into account those signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is unbelievable that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "reasonable assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and would not comply with its procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish jurisdiction, which demanded him to interrogate in his territory for a claimed sexual offence, while "the Swedish law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa explained that the risk that the health and psychic condition of Assange would be affected would be.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not a serious thing," said Ecuador's Head of State.
However, there is a risk that he may take physical and psychological damage because he was caught in a close room and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect every human health," he added.
Correa argued that the solution for the asylum, which Assange has been granted since June in the Ambassador of Ecuador in London, was the granting of a letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been discussions with London to find a solution for the enclosed founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures on various European instances," he explained.
And "I believe that if Britain gives this letter tomorrow, this is done."
And when Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on the Ambassador of Ecuador in London or about Skype, how it was allowed and made in other cases, the problem would be tackled.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defendant of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate, "the medianity, the evil intention and the lie that enforces the free expression of opinion."
"The largest enemys of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and oppress," he said.
In this sense he congratulated that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and neither by the bankers nor by the hegemonic and spoiling-burger countries," and prejudiced that he will "depth the revolution to continue the way in this right direction" when he was re-elected.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not be allowed to take place in opportunism and none as a legally declared state strain" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also holds the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Haag, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime borders between both countries with Nicaragua, for "absolutely legitimate".
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Mediterranean State.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in their pursuit of a common path.
They must be fully treated in order to overcome and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes on the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "It is right for Latin America to call on international instances if both countries are obliged to accept the judgment, even if it is very difficult."
As regards the possibility of presenting himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate in success, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in the wrong circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I must fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as president, then I'd withdraw from public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"This is a decision," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he traveled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a fall in the health condition of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the Ecuadorian Head of State took part in Lima on the sixth summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended by calling for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Reason for the death of AIDS is too late today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the results of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb was beaten," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "swap" without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such an effort that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unity of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more Stigmata.
At that time, even the director of a Clinic of the IMSS failed to say goodbye, "because it led to a sack gas."
At that time AIDS was synonymous to death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the hospital, who do not know about their disease and who have already damaged the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means survival of a patient who takes treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained the head of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a viewed scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of injury of the people’s immune system at the start of treatment, and that there are greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years when counting 500 CD4.
Simplely, the above statements mean that whoever gets the diagnosis HIV-positive in this sense can become "usually 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this professional.
In order to correctly organize this progress, it must be reminded that the Mexicans' expectation of life is an average of 76 years today.
Even if death has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (OnUSIDA Annual Report), it is still true that 60 percent of the patients involved in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die on it?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with medicines. The problem is that people come into a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so all those who need this must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees to the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also to the patients like Fabrizio who were able to carry out his test at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason because it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the Kaposi sarcoma (a cancer-like tumour) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather put it three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, practice sports and take the medicines.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his witness those who are afraid today in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are large holes between the health programmes and the simple citizens, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has adopted the case of HIV.
And most important is prevention.
At the places specified there, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were individually delivered, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the risk subjects for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread spot question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmaceuticals and health systems that do not want to suspend youths, the correspondent assured.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condoms should not only be behind the shop table, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and the motel, as governor Emilio González answered the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already exercise sexual activity," he pointed it out.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally located on the fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and on the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of inflammatory cases occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people not known for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unhealthy precautionary case is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
It could therefore be said that in the country of Stars and Stripes, the procedures for survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas of the northern district of Texas on 15 June leads to a helpless exposure to the Mexican companies to the conquest of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call on the United States' Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal first states that the main procedure is the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity of payment by companies with a cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was created for the unity of international trade law, whereby the American Law Institute was set up as a plainer.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass of Vitro's branches with their parent company, would not have been achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
Furthermore, after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of his difficult situation from 2008 under the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country a hit.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same court of appeal so that the vote will be taken at the plenary session, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
In the absence of this, the Cerciorare objection, which requires the review of the procedure by a higher instance, shall be made by the United States Supreme Court.
The serious case is that the court left a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in the context of the Act on Trade Conkurses, and in which it is pointed out that it had been strictly complied with the agreements signed by the two countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Conkurs Act.
It is also noted that the country has subjected to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules for the cases of cross-border inability to pay, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramble: a battle for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After the advertising by the Mexican Air Traffic Associations against the former owner Gaston Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, did not progress several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Company Association of Pilots) finally made progress.
The attempt referred to by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is being convicted to disabilities for justice.
Afterwards, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the Republic's main management of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur to remove from the trust account F/589 of the Bank IXE on the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrstradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we talk about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented to a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In front, the Canacintra (the national Chamber of the Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment that partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a question of the Senate to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Own.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had taken the possibility out of consideration, because he considered it a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In the pursuit of long-term liabilities without interfering with short-term liabilities, the Homex Stock Exchange Company places more than 500 million pesos on the market.
The emission is the first of four equal emissions which promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
The company NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, founded a group of companies under the name Competival, whose aim is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The World Bummer of the Basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to the wheelchair for a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was a player of lower classes, players of the first national lieutenants and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"I have been in the basketball for my life many guards, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered at a visit from Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife, for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated and witnessed with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who at his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-contractor or manager of the club.
"This were my best years that I've enjoyed most because I have been allowed to be a part of eight masterships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a manager, co-contractor or trainer.
There were many satisfying years, including the five championships together from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted with a mastership of 1981, the year of debt of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the freecast specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a resident and was one of our best Werfers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time at the Vorolympic tournament in Mexico.
Then the World Championship came in 1990, where we took the fourth place, which should actually be bronze, if not this Canadian arbitrator, which let us repeat the last tour for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the Olympics 2004.
My favorite, however, is the team of the Pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the U.S. team a fight, as at the time when they won against us at the world championship of Bronze.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) were back in that team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Qijote" Morales, who could not be involved in 1990 because of a kne injury.
A team that may not have been the best of personality, but with which we won a gold medal and which made us great joy, was those of the 1995 pre-lympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the events on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various bodies in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boys like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 crews in a season.
What else are you doing?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and first meet in the national playoffs on crews from other corners of the island.
Today the children do unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the results of the required training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music from my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), and was world wide famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrubbleless, stupid and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new "Dallas" staircase, died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros, producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birthtown Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the festivals of the Harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He enjoyed all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived life in full trains," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with liver cirrhosis, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over years.
In 1995 a malicious tumour was detected in his liver, and he undergone a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known in television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Amazing Jeannie" of the NBC television department.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dhin" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He was also a performer of two comodies, which were only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema work included well-evaluated roles in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the awesome J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the Ewing Clan and other figures in its surroundings was radiated from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising "Who shot on J.R.?", which should create the expectation of a episode full of emotions, where the figure was almost killed by Hagmann, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in competition houses.
The series thus reached a viewer record at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who transformed "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had swung her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, immaterable man with a charismatic smile: a reluctant businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to instruct his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what is supposed to be on J.R.'s grave stone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizens J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, a meddressor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "enormous personality up and outside of the screen".
He is unforgettable and inevitable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts to those who have the luck in knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were issued a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staffel was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the transmitter.
By Warner or by TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she received Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in the New York theatre beans early in the 1950s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer May Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California City of Malibu, where many famous places have their residence.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Number (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything of which I thought it could hurt someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After he liver transplantation, he worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's gonna be okay for you."
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studys the "Ende of the World"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and chemistry and global heating.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistent angelshake: the end of the "long back counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21th, of which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, some called Deudarmaggedon, and a growing conflict with Israel, the place from which Christian theoretists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptical semester that ever existed," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic intellectuality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which should actually be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, the accompanying professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Medies, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and chemistry and global heating.
"We analyze why these ideas spread in time," he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a accompanying professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The end of the world".
"We do not record 2012 so that we can always keep the option to re-keep the course in case the world does not fall," said Restall.
Despite the "existing destruction" students must study, create projects and participate in graduate audits.
In Penn State, the final audit is carried out in the early evening of the Apokalypse, so the students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for students with a high average, filling with 35 students.
For weeks before semester start, we received emails from students who asked if there were still places free.
The students assure them that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic secrecy or religious democracy is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explained to psychology and nursing have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he announced.
I enjoy it.
But none of the interviewed students - and less than a professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of Mayas, and in some way we discredit them," said Julie Seglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only one key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in the western society that brings back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Other places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who instructs the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the end of the world there.
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an expression to an exception of a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall pointed out that many days were spoken by the last court over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21 "the people think immediately of a new date" or philosophed that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period, which would be the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
