Goodach: More security for footgängers
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 football Temple on the village parking lot was taken into operation in Gutach - in the sight of the older Rathausampel.
Two plants so close to each other: intent or sign-bourgeois?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's Mayor yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was then installed because it secured the schoolway," explained Eckert yesterday.
The cluster ampel secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle inhabitants.
The installation officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, the Kurpark, the bus stop, a physician and a bank, as well as the transport flow from the residential area ›Grub.
"In the high rise of transport and pedestrians, for their safety, a further accord had to be found," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Department of Land Consultation of Apenburg.
"On the B 33 daily, according to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles are going through the municipality of Gutach, of which about 10 percent of heavy load traffic are," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another ampel is more than necessary: "Security is just going on here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, and a circuit was proposed, but because of the closeness of the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected.
According to Arnold, when choosing the Ampelmasters, everything was first tested: "We have tested if these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbach Road to the B 33 without climbing the ampelmasters."
The approximately 15 000 euros expensive amplification system itself is the "modernst what is currently on the market", explained Arnold.
The installation is equipped with coloured LEDs that light so strong that the lights of the car drivers, for example, are well recognized in deep sun.
And she is also sparing: the older light plants use about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three light plants per drive direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the footer presses the ampel button, the upper radar sensor tests the transport position.
If the road is free, comes immediately green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"If a group or disabled people are going across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone comes safely over the railway," explained Arnold.
Of course, the car driver must think here as a partner and watch the railway.
This wasn't the case yesterday: The ampel for pedestrians was shown green, a high-class vehicle emitted through - in light red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth of the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hanging of rough violence and stubborn sexuality, the narrow and freudlessness - have often described the corn poem poem.
Known is the Buchner price carrier mainly as prosaautor, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Wetterlights on the tongue tip", which is now to be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosatexts.
For example, the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographicly characterised Roman "The Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Look, his family beauerend" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a circuited sofa, on which the text material is circulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance exceeds the template with a filling of government invasions, known from the stock post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses are involved in the somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with their head under water, with their evening ropes robbed to the wall.
Restricted in cellophane or muds, they stabbed on dangerous high stocks through the inscension, either monologize them loudly or lie completely stumbled on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this strange way.
The best moments have the evening when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to national songs.
First to the end, the overwhelming performance comes something to rest, and Winklers afternooned absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planers are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that is located in each car's armature board.
The devices recording every travelled mileage and reporting the information to the authorities are the core point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Office to revise the obsolete system for the financing of US roads.
The most frequently boring area of road planning has suddenly unfolded an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberties have joined environmental groups and are proposing that the government can use the small boxes to record the travelled kilometers – and perhaps where they were driven – and then use the information for the calculation of tax notifications.
The Tea Party is disturbed.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while you cannot agree on an action at the convention, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently checking how they can switch to a system in the next ten years, paying the driver per travelled mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the travel writers, some of whom are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing that we’ll only use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles traveled by all California’s car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for it is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes that Americans pay at the barbecue, is plunged.
But in America, no more is taken as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone (less than 4 eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare at high sprite prices to raise taxes by just one cent.
Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel writers to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most long-term meaningful alternative," he said.
Office crates call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is convinced by urban liberals, for example, taxes could be used to influence driving behaviour so that steady and climate-sensitive exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californian Planners set up the system for the development of strategies aimed at achieving the ambitious, legitimate objectives of the federal state for climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he sees the most walkable long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also advocated by the idea of allowing drivers to pay on a retired route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Directives on Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who had invited the Congress to move towards miles-based accounting in a 2011 report.
Last year, the US Senat approved a $90 million expensive pilot project, which included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the incidence and thus responded to the concerns of rural members who represent people who often have to leave many miles on the way to work or to the city every day.
Several states and large cities are moving in this direction spite of their own.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mile charges instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers this.
Illinois tests it in restricted measure with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), currently examines how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical when thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Respect against Big Brother and such things were a major problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Performance Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want to.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on their website: “It would be relatively easy to transform the drivers into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, blocked technological infrastructure that would be used indefinitely to record data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of state states who are now looking out for affordable technology, with which the State can track the travelled kilometers, but not exactly when and where.
That, like Khan, would be more calm to the public.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially come in to help states in the taxation of car drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in a rising market for Kfz insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the driving miles.
However, the devices she tested are also interesting for the road planers, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“The people are rather willing to participate when their speed and locations are not recorded,” explained Ryan Morrison, manager of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment to give car drivers a number of choices.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a fixed fee on the basis of the average miles travelled by all inhabitants of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrusted public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, transport officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees, a insurance only needs to be paid for travelled kilometers and speed data from other vehicles in real-time, thanks to which car drivers can avoid Staus.
“Automobiles would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate,” says a city planning document.
However, some transport plans wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials declared that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be charged to carriers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for surgery if an aspirin is sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little crew beat awake
The volunteer firefighter managed its autumn main sample despite personal deficiency with bravour.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in the Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
It is supposed that there was a short lock when sawing.
Due to the rising fire and the development of smoke, two people were injured, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respiratory guarders made themselves ready to enter the building.
In a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be weared.
This was not so easy, as a tight staircase was to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated assembling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machines for wood processing.
The first removal attack took place through the tank in the vehicle.
Another direction took place via a overflow hydrogen in about 100 meters distance.
Now three removal attacks could be designed.
A hole radiation pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise of what is to be done with little staff available.
In the serious case, support is made via the Kingsfeld day entry group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzzwald, Landtagspresident Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about the origin of the workers from tomorrow.
In the high-schwarzzwald funding centre, he examined this important question, together with the managers of the professional schools, as well as the circuit gymnasium and the council chairmans.
"Employment is an important location factor", underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center High-Swarmzzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration in the forest town between the funding centre, the circuit gymnasium and the professional school centre.
He also praised the family kindness in the countryside.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in mind, but because of demographic change, it is also the phase to care for family care," said Wolf.
In addition, he argued that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their family.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden of employees can lead to a discontinuation of the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For whoever has already learned the benefits of the region during his study remains often acquiring the regional economy with its acquired knowledge and skills, which contributes to strengthening the region," the country day president proved convinced.
For only if adequate training sites were offered, the need for professionals could also be satisfied.
It believes that the land circle's location benefit is its advantageous position in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
On his railway from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
"Keep persistent and make sure that public transport is getting better," he explained to the address of the present communal politicians.
Music experiences a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family invites the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly fellow citizens were served in the raising place.
This afternoon will take place in St. Joseph's nursing home.
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and torches.
Later there was worst salad.
With common melodies, Silvia spoke Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school court to the church street is to be set again on the reconciliation plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the rehabilitation of the front school court, to stabilise and static discharge of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach provides Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger City Building Office to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the plans and to create a remedy concept for the old wall.
It is then intended to be calculated by experts, which will then be placed on the table to the municipality for decision-making and determining the further approach.
A decision on this is expected to fall in the next year.
After the reconstruction, planting and planting of the old school court within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it must be resolved and placed on new underbuilding in the absence of time.
The historical, a hundred years old delimiting wall of the old school court to the church street, is especially due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, needs sanitation and has a bowling forward.
Depth rices in individual stones are evident injury to weather, but the wall is not at present in danger.
A standproof wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use school court, which has been done by the current firming work.
Originally, school court rehabilitation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall rehearsal that has even been used for filming will convey to the country's density office.
If standards come from this page, the city hopes brines for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Brunlinger primary school, who are now instructed again in a well-sanhed old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school court.
Özdemir wants Jazz training in Stuttgart
In the persistent discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now turned on.
"I think it's wrong to give up holistic training at the University of Music Stuttgart," said Özdemir the Stuttgart News.
Jazz and classics are just part of Stuttgart's jazz location.
In this way, Özdemir, who is in Stuttgart as a favourite for a direct mandate in the Federal Day election on 22 September, contradicts the Green-Roten National Government.
This forces a new order of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg based on an expert study.
Then, among other things, Jazz and Pop will be moved from the University of Music at the University of Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. limit: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, detectors have discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities notified, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroads and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through the radar," said the U.S. prosecutor of the Southern California district, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where it had been discovered an end of the tunnel.
Duffy insured the drug bands: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006 more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel, the detectives assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year.
The sliding system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel intang.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 cm width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine foundation.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the conquered marihuana.
All three are threatened as the highest punishment of lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of drug bands whose traditional routes have been cut off now, says Bill Sherman from the DEA drug capture in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the arrested, at least one of the Mexicans, were called.
You have to expect penalties for up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first original mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is on.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together 794 originally.
A document was made in churches where both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official opening to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen has no hall at present, this event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be 1250 in July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Go back to celebration.
On Friday with a festival, Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall.
Also, at this festival is the church-house church festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote a composition on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and dedicated in the anniversary year, the official date is the last September week, 27 and 28 September.
At the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new history is also released.
"It is supposed to be a chronic not only by Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the gisingen of today, which consists of geisingen, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadeningen," says Mayor Walter Hengster.
And today's gisingen celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 the present space was completed with the communities.
The new history will then be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8th at the time of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival banket on March 29th and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Old Work Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the spring festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gifting document in 764, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The document was made in churches (houses), which were then courts.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason to celebrate this 1250 year accordingly in 2014 is also 40 years back.
The Council takes the glazing plants into the vision
Should the railway transition "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipalities have decided.
Shiltach must take over 220 000 euros for this.
The German railway will improve the Kinzigtal railway in the next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of railways - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles occur in all parts.
If the municipalities agree with the restructuring measures, they must participate in the costs with one third, the rest shares railway and covenant.
Shiltach's master Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the special features of the "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a booking at the height of the tunnel tunnel tunnel west of the railroad.
There, too, larger vehicles, such as those transporting long wood, could stand in counter traffic without having to block the glaze.
Hence, greeters suggested to design a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the subsequent road at the given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of transport.
This was discussed controversially in the municipality, since some Councils questioned the need for a road dissemination: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of the critics to the point, "Is it necessary for so few vehicles to handle so much money?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The "Hirschen" railway is used regularly for long-hour transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported through this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberles bridge because they could not turn down the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
It should be considered that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and resettled, as is currently in Wolfach, the transition "Am Hirschen" could also have an important significance of transport for a longer period.
The Councils agreed to examine the cost of the planned distribution of the road.
Nevertheless, the restructuring of the railway transit has been largely agreed with the measure that the necessary support wall is built in a way that the city could, if necessary, expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for encounter transport to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the restructuring of the railway transition in the Gerberei Traut wine could lead to a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhausweg".
The administration had examined the reconstruction plans of the railway by the Breinlinger Engineering Office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection to the Geroltzhuis was still possible without any further.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the inclinations of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit down.
Responsibility for this is again the city as a road construction load carrier.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both wooden output and declining were working in the current expansion state, it was not supposed to agree to the restructuring of the railway transition, Haas argued.
The risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the road is also significantly lower than at the other railways, because it is directly at the centre of the stop point to which a good approach exists.
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be broken down at this point so far that no collision threatens.
Mostly, the restructuring of this railway was refused, since the city of Schiltach had to "badge out" the problem of seating vehicles, says the Councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The body considers the restructuring of the railways "Four Heubach" and "Four Kuhbach" for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - European space agency experts must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers.
No one knows whether there are lives at least on some of them.
The selection is difficult: should you look for gravity waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or was it a planet like that, perhaps discovering a life outside the world?
These questions are just asking the responsibles of the European Space Agency, Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to promote research.
The basis for such "L missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elites of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of them have now come into the closer choice.
Many bodies review the proposals, hacking up with researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions, Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the 2007-initiated programme "Cosmic Vision".
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact operations of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the darkness of words.
A large infrarotelescope in the All could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can there be life?
In order to examine this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will begin in 2017, with 500 already known planet systems in our closer surroundings to be examined more accurately.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments the astronomers could depict similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmosphere and thus look for "Biomarkers": gases that are considered as an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide information on the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these events can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already granted a mission of the M class (this is the budget at about a half billion euros) for this question.
The sun is intended to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
For this, Esa provides the first of the three total L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Sonde "Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer" is expected to start their trip in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is intended to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the iron moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The universal offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus examine whether our known natural laws are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also differences that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How has the universe originated and what does it consist of?
13,7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Urknall.
In addition to our common matter, from stars, planets and living beings as we exist, there are dark matters whose gravity combines galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, by which the expansion of the world has accelerated.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the urchal, nor what dark matter and dark energy consisted of.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission whose start is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sun is intended to investigate the distribution of matters in the universe for the first time throughout the sky and thus allow for reflections on the nature of dark matter and darker energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two of them will be left at the end of the selection procedure.
Many experts believe that the best chances of granting L mission have "E-Lisa", a demanding concept for the detection of gravity waves.
This includes physicist changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had foretold almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven until today.
Elisha could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a two- or three-son detector that is stationed in the All.
Unlike plants on earth, it could also demonstrate gravity waves that were created at the urchal, thus providing new knowledge of the creation of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", to detect and investigate planets like this.
Among other things, there are proposals for sample back transport from Mars, for the research of moons, venus and asteroids, as well as for sun physics.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany as regards U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, Whistleblower of the American Secret Service, has explained that he is willing to travel to Berlin and tell out before the German Federal Day when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
The German member Hans-Christian Strøbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where this asylum was received to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Strøbele, it writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat a distinct opinion as a breach of faithfulness and attempts to criminalize political opinion with a threat of criminality, where there is no defence possible."
Saying the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to let the charge against him fall.
The charge raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spying and stealing of state property.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German representatives, we will find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Mr Oppermann, Member of the Secret Service Committee, declared that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible, "without endangering him and destroying all relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA staff, Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, says the Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a "strong and ongoing" persecution campaign that expelled him from his home.
However, it is affected by the global reaction to "my political opinion act".
Citizens around the world as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a debt in the public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties have been solved around the humanitarian situation".
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to stick on their flight luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was read that passengers should keep the whole dosage.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage over the seat, small bags below the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who paid only on the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to demand fees for the first and second abandoned baggage.
Passengers who tried to handle them have therefore stopped as much as possible in the hand baggage, resulting in that the baggage bags are often overfilled above the seat.
Taxes are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that at the new fee it's not really about earning money.
It was about the most faithful customers from frontiers who had clearly expressed that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the section above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a baggage on frontier flight, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley explained that the website of frontiers and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the flight.
The new handbaggage fee of frontier will only take effect in the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers are frequently cheating on luggage supplements and other fees, but airlines are happy to take back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage should cost money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many at Wall Street view the new luggage fees as signs that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
However, most of them have left the fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fees for handbags and later alliant Air followed, also a cheap flighter.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained Airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully follows the additional fees.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that the hand baggage fee brings Spirit 50 million dollars per year.
Sorensen, who formerly had a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently fled with Spirit and was curious about what would be expected at the flight trip if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand baggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the most smoothly experienced in my career in the aviation,” he said.
I expected to see dental cinnamons and hand-handsome discussions at the flight climb.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as swallowed.”
Frontiers also follow Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the whole dosage and be filled with coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had attempted to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but this returned seven months later, after complaining passengers and no other large society had been retracted.
Frontiers step to charge fees for the hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly at the airline, is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per sold ticket.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchase instead of via an online travel office.
However, frontiers have been the largest in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half so many multi-fly miles when booking via an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
Therefore, a flight travel booked by a third party with a frontier of over 1,000 miles brings customers in only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively on the frontier places website for direct purchase.
Frontier has a faithful customer tribe at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The return decreased by 9 per cent and the air capacity decreased nearly 13 per cent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to handle the financial resources of frontiers in the context of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
Some 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church Congregation of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house was "Speaking Words from the Bible" and "Speaking from the Middle Ages".
Sita Köhler, chairman of the Church Council, entered the Bible words in a lecture after breakfast.
"Precise words contain ways of life, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called words such as: Be watchful of wooden eye, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone who gives it to the Lord in sleep, wash his hands in indebtedness.
A number of times the referendum also gave her audience advice on what the pronunciation was.
The Mediterranean talks adopted by Christian Dehner: All good things are three, blue, cut a little.
It explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called "bridges in the past".
At the end, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were transferred to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round, Mayor Attendant Roman Waizenegger was also mixed.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for uninstructed people in tourism
On the Mecklenburg Sea Plate starts a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already uninstructed in the industry are to be qualified to professionals for hotels and guest places over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with grades," said Carmen Wiechert from the Newbrandenburg work agency.
The benefit is widespread: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would receive trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and guest places, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The industrial and commercial chambers in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststätenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that an "internal error" and not hackers are guilty of the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday that an error has lamed its public website for a few hours and not hackers as they claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unreachable for a few hours tonight because a internal error occurred during the planned update,” the spy agency explained in an email-sensitive report.
The problem was resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
A spokesman of the NSA had previously explained to ABC News that the sensible internal network of the Authority was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hactivists claimed to have lamed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site will be flooded with site calls until the servers are overloaded and the website is collapsed.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to intervene in the internal network of the target system.
The former super secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such agency), is now found in the bright light of the public and sees the discoveries known in recent months about its extensive monitoring programme in domestic and foreign criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA colleague Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculations about that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyper surgery.
The number of people without job was slightly decreased in October by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3,1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we had hoped more," says Monika Felder-Builder, vice-president of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
For many companies have so far responded to the behaviour of settings.
One reason for this is, according to field builders, "We have little professionals in craft, health and old care".
Annual periods have also taken place again since September for staff in the hotel and guest places industry.
In mid-December the winter season begins there.

Profit infringements in bombards by decline in delivery numbers and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percentage decline in net profit after he had been pressured by decline orders and deliverys to aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway park.
Bombardiers with a seat in Montreal did not publish flight test data for his brand new plane of CSeries and did not provide any new information on whether the plane could go to commercial use in the next September according to the ambitious schedule.
On the juvenile flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, only three more launches have been followed, so it appears to be questioned whether the test phase is as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a course crash of over eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyzer at National Bank Financial, reduced on Thursday his evaluation from "outperform" to "sector" in order to ensure that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Two were mostly expected to be weaker delivery numbers in aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed from the margin development in the transport sector,” said Dorksen in a customer letter.
We believe that bombardiers will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the plane progresses.
However, if no new orders are made known in the coming months, we expect the market to become more creative to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries fly series can cataplerate the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after monthly delays for the first time in September.
However, to date, mandatory orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and wishing to see whether the claims of the company regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new fertilizer aircraft are applicable.
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President-in-Office Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 mandatory orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the Jet.
Corporate management also insured on Thursday to analytists and media that the programme is in the timetable.
“The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that during the time of the plane, ground testing and software updates have been performed.
Every manufacturer plants differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a review period, whatever we have done.
This is happening during the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks, the remainder shortly afterwards, named it from company side.
However, analytists remain skeptical whether twelve months after the first customer can run a CSeries plane.
Bombardier declared that it reviews the planning for the start-up (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if it seems to be in line with the internal planning of bombardiers – strengthens our view that the entry into service is moving to the first quarter of 2015,” said Dorksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30th, bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The turnover dropped slightly and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analytists had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer suggests that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net exposures fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The commission stock in the air and space party was $32.9 billion on September 30, and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
“In the area of air and space, the results were in the context of our rules, but the low order entry and market conditions were totally disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
The turnover in the air and space parcels fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the sales in this spare has increased by nearly 11 percent to $2.2 billion.
The contracting stock in the transport party was $32.6 billion on 30 September and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The transport profit margin has been affected by resolving problems in some large contracts.
According to business management, there will be new rules for the fourth quarter.
In the post-member trade on Thursday, the bombardier share was 8.5 per cent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that the Google Finance Board Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten-percent reduction of the quarterly win on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police detection must be imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, transmitted information on subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependency could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defendant who warned a drug baron against a large police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug abuse could be discovered was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on the detection of its activities in the drug trade after he had been compromised by his own cocaine disease.
The lawyer praised by criminalists with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police watched Scarborough, which he had represented in a former drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a dinner of the lawyer chamber.
The investigations revealed that thista regularly consumed drugs of Class A after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the framework of a large investigation procedure on heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine at a number of house searches at a value of 1.5 million pounds and $200,000 pounds of cash.
Thista, 42, transmitted information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become audience.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Office of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found and sentenced to the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for disabilities of justice.
He admitted to the cocaine owner at a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detection officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and there the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s waste tones.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Ditta, who was at the football stage of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, this was announced to be a "regulative consumer" of cocaine after tests of drugs of Class A had been discovered in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Thista was arrested later, but refraining to take cocaine and said he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "advocate secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and took a hair sample from him.
At police interrogation, he announced that he operates a office under his private address as well as at work, and clients would call him home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called on important drug trade stakeholders, from whom he had previously represented some of them, after significant arrests and informed about what the detectives knew about them.
Advocate Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken.”
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defendant, since he has joined too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer but a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and Mandant.
He resisted the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to check their criminal activities.
This brought Mr Ditta into question his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Thista pointed out every mistake and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and I wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but do so immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire: “Herr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals.”
His cocaine dependency led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive for the motives of leading members of organised crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this trust and has tried to put himself behind the phasade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning for criminals and show that no one can withdraw from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Five and thirty more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total punishments of 153 years for drug killers.
On his website, Ditta published a field of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer client in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and chance inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To complete the celebrations due to its 160-year-old existence, the Song Kranz Dunningen will embrace two religious services with the "German fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life", which the spectators enthusiasticed in the spring of this year, the song crance to the end of the anniversary year will enrich two religious services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday 26 October, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinus Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10:15 p.m. in the church of St. Johannes Baptists in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a religious musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The fair is presented in the context of the services of God, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the leather group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism weakens confidence
For example, with the elections to the 2015 parish municipality, Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
Then there is only one common parish municipality for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for changes.
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is to the prerogatives to implement them as satisfactory as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly evident: the skepticism to the new one is hesitatingly weighing a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish municipality, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the seal care team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, the Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly adopted directives for seal care units in the Erzdiözese Freiburg.
Then, as a church community, SE Haslach will form a public law body that enters into the rights and duties of the six church communities so far.
There will be only one common parish municipality and a foundation council in which the practitioner force is represented.
Each parish shall be represented by at least two selected members, where six parishes are formed on-site so-called community teams.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish municipality then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods in the parishes remain connected.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the general community.
There were great concerns just with regard to the large planned investments, whose obligation then takes all the parishes.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," relatived Haslach's Pfarrgemeinderats Chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes depicted Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the board in the seal care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves a task in 2006, "One, five stays" and had to find that it wasn't so easy at all.
The bodies of Haslacher Seal Care Unit then responded to the questions concerning the future composition and size of the common parish municipality and the practical work of the community team.
The preparations will be specificized at further meetings and will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, Priest municipality Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seal care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the power becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must set up higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the town works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SUIDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorf family accounts for EUR 70 to 90 more costs per year.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the increase in the so-called EEC environment from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This turnover will be re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity railways.
These count the additional costs resulting from the energy turn, which they can raise by turning over the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf town works form the last member in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of Energy Company was even based on a higher turnover, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments must be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We go out from an increase of 1 cent plus x", says Bias, where the number is rather close to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes an ampel just doesn't get green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
Then what do you do - ride with red?
Having waited long enough for a red ampel and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "admissible", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises you to endure at least five minutes before a disturbance of the ampel has to be eliminated.
Anyone who continues to travel despite red lights, however, must be clear that he is blamed for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision by the Oberlandegericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ampel after about three minutes of durability and had to be responsible for a violent red light violation.
The ampel wasn't defective, but it jumped on green a little later.
A ban on driving remained to him because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
Congregation enjoys solid budget
Always when it comes to meetings on the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The municipal sack in Herdpressen-Schönach is well filled and debts have been lost since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million higher than planned.
The excess of the administrative budget also amounts to about EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
In particular, the overcome is due to higher commercial tax revenues and the share of income taxes in the Community.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it was EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher supply from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since smaller investments have been made in 2012 than were planned, refunds have also been increased.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by approximately 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"So a work is not just shaken out of the arm," Gerster praised with a view to the annual account.
He and the municipalities were delighted by the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but just these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens.
By the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to refrain from high elevations.
However, according to Gerster, the land has often cut the grants.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensations.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must provide certain lifts.
"The issue of lifting rates must be seen, since in the coming years investments we would like to have subsidies for," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story is nearly twice as long as the autumn festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his male singing units on the stage.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the choir that is probably more than lovely gained still makes him a great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and association, he received a number of awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Reference at the commission of the Cäcilien Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, delivered to him a document of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues gave him the document of the German Chorverband as well as a gravated tinner counter.
In addition to honour, the 31st autumn festival was in common railways: With the MGV Betra, the Song Kranz Salzstätten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music association, the full margers had loaded a colorful mixture of various chors and singing styles, which the about 400 visitors had.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with vocal songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Finish, their brothers".
Your honourful singer Hubert Wermter prepared them to honor a little bit more - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The male singer association Betra also sang classic choir songs such as "Jägerwerven" by Julius Wengert, "Away, far away" by Hubert Goisern as well as the people's song "When you walk through the valley".
The song crance of Salt Stetts with its mixed choir and its female group - the "Impulschor" - provided the women's rate of the festival.
The mixed choir was kidnapped by Antos Gus in foreign countries with the neapolitan genus "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana", while the "Impulschor" also took back to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The Baisinger Sports Association's singer department came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to home Filde, where the Fullmaringer Music Association offered the glorious musical conclusion.
For the children, there was a small adjunct programme - "Mamma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer led up a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children were busy on the lunch.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The children's gardens and children's day places in the customs circuit get post in these days.
The Black Forest Bote, in collaboration with the building house and the Sparkasse Customs Nalb, wants to support the facilities in realising their construction and decoration wishes.
Does the children's garden need a new sandbox?
Participating in the action can all children's gardens, children's day places and children's cripples from the whole circuit of customs duties.
If you have a building or encouraging wish for your facility, you can apply it to the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Action Children's Garden building site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Building House and Sparkasse Customs Nalb, chooses three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with construction material at a maximum value of EUR 2000 and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner itself has to provide for many diligent building helpers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
The building house provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Customs Nulb.
It will be delivered to the children's garden on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the teachers and children themselves.
Kenian press disgraces about controversial media law
"We are in a terrible situation, and we must ask ourselves, what does the Parliament prevent from simply resolving the judicial independence tomorrow?", was read in the newspaper which considers the draft law not constitutional.
“The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, including CapitalFM, one of the most renowned independent radio stations and news sites Kenias.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be predominant because it is a longer arm of the government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we are calling on him to reject this draft law and to return to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is taking the media effectively into a wreck grip by means of the new law. The standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya, however, has suffered “a severe battle” and describes the draft as “draconic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a number of measures to strengthen national security as a result of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew up the wrath of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which to see how the units sent to the customer claimed to have robbed the luxurious shopping center.
Police director David Kimaiyo responded to the order of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a media call.
According to the new law, media houses can be charged with a punishment of up to 20 million Kenian Schillingen and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the ownership of the subjects if a punishment is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single punishment may push most radio broadcasters into bankruptcy”.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenia's 'living blood sphere' description.
If they need the media to silence, politicians could do unpunished whatever they want.
“Nobody will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist of the nation, which calls the Kenian media a decisive control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians themselves, they bring the country back into the bankruptcy and us into the time of hunters and collectors,” he commented.
The Kenian legislators have already in the past raised public problems.
In May they voted in favour of reducing the reductions ordered by the national remuneration commission and reimbursing their defective wages of about 532,000 Schilling free of charge per month – they are one of the highest worldwide.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
On the importance of the city and the football club, the official envival feast for the artificial racial sports lot despite the cold whitting and rain was nothing.
A more pleasant hour of celebration was probably all wished last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
Thus all those who came without a rainshield or couldn't hold one for any reason.
This was the case with the musicians who embraced the festival, just like some speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were mainly to Mayor Walter Klummp, who had been very engaged in the implementation of the project, to the municipality, to the involved companies and to the members of the associations who entered into the project.
This is especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The calm pensioners moved 400 square meters of patches for the new paths.
This remarkable ambition was also worthwhile to the Landtagsabgeordnet Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were spoken to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Bad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the Youth Department of the Club.
Mayor Klump reminded that in the spring and autumn, recurring whiteness-related influences added to the original grass place so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first thoughts to solve the problem when it was thought of building a third place at the site of the football club or at the real school at the Salinen Sea.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago, thoughts came up for the construction of an artificial breeding sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago when the FC took over the barbecue in heritage patch, promised a cost participation of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipality decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000, cumbered together.
The beginning of the 68 times 108 meters large artificial grass square was made on June 4th.
During the construction phase of over three months, 3000 cubic metres of earth were carried out, of which half was used for the construction of a dirt bike stretch.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of interior and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, Membership and Federal Police.
In the morning, the group of migration and integration wanted to continue its discussions.
It should include the subject of double citizenship, where both sides have contradiction.
The SPD wants the force for migrant children born in Germany to decide for one to quit - the Union refuses a double passport.
On the subject of traffic that is not on the agenda of the meeting on this Friday, the SPD understood its no to a car mout required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flatrate for multi-driving and thus ecologically contraproductive", explained the SPD negotiating leader for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened roads from the roads, which are already accidental difficulty.
The introduction of a wall for all cars would also be only a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is the risk that the compensation for Germans will be deleted at a later time," he said.

Airport Vienna takes away passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In future there will be no more throughsays like this at Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
A large majority of the speakers' throughspeakers fall away with this - the noise mill is to be so clearly lowered.
Creating a more relaxing atmosphere is the goal of this renewal.
As airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of throughsights affecting individuals.
Thus, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoned by noise calls.
The loss of these throughsights - an average of about 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - will make it more quiet at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passovers have been observed relatively little, but at the same time all other information about changed flights or departure times are going down here a bit," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio broadcaster.
Highlander-games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake train with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn festival on the cold farm from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the highlander game starts at 13.30.

Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of trees, cushions and carrying waters.
Four and a half metres of the tree is long and 25 to 30 kilos heavy.
"It doesn't come on the wide," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The tribe needs to be thrown off vertically, to be overthrowd once and then to be just lying.
This is assessed by most points.
In the case of cushion, it depends on the precision of the target.
From eight meters distance is thrown on a pflock.
Skill and power must prove the participants in the water removal of more than 50 meters.
Time and quantity of water are measured at the end.
From every "Clan" or team, two can then participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive prices.
Train can be trained from 10 o'clock.
The desire is a suitable clothing, for example, the racers can come into the shore.
But also Swedish cargo is allowed.
For "outfit" the jury still forgives a few bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander gambling and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is a lot of action on the festival site on Saturday.
In the evening, blow music friends come at their expenses.
At 19 p.m., the bira-bohemian blasmic from Schömberg forms the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays great Polkas and martyrs.

Organizers are the Promotor Association Multipurpose Hall, the Ski Club and the tractor friends of the "Tand-Käpselle".
Milk and egg alternatives in overview
Veganeous diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
For example, purged tofu with plant soil is a quarker set.
Others call the Vegetary Federation for the World Vegetation on 1 November.
The vegetarian Federation in Germany suggests a number of vegan alternatives at the time of the World Vegetation Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margins are a good alternative to butter, yoghurt will be replaced by sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, porter, mandel or rice milk could be used.
Spotable plant cream supposes traditional stroke.
There are also plant alternatives for eggs.
For example, a half depressed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake.
50 grams of apple mice or a dining leather grinded leather, plus three dining spoons of water, are suitable for it.
For example, the deigs become more seamless instead of eggs with a mixture of a tea spoon of back powder, a dining spoon of food strength and three dining spoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of Sojajoghurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest gymnasium were acquainted with the American large city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it went to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached at foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous Skyline, which is a special irritation in the evening light.
Through the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on the legs, but trusted in the motto "The city is not sleeping" the day was decided at the Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the statue of freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed at foot.
Then it went over the financial centre on Wall Street to the Memorial Site of 11 September.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meters high outlook platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hactic driving of the New York Streets through the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay shortly in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their guest families and experienced the school everyday at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a hubertus fair is celebrated on the name of the Holy Hubertus in the church of St. Marien at the Hülsberg Street.
St. Hubertus was the story of a fairly disrespectless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Kleinich.
The Hunthorn Blaser Group of the Hunter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth museums on parforce horns (Naturhorns in the Atmosphere) for old, original French melodies.
The bladder wears riding clothes because they mainly accompany horses, horses and dogmeets on dragging musical.
The celebration fair will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed look is shiny with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, a psychological phenomenon is called Déjà Vu, which is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the same named café in the circuit town of Kleve in view of the University of Rhein-Waal, it must not remain at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café, with the beautiful name, has exactly this goal: a real stay is not only thoughtful but always to make it experienceable again and again.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the interior life at the look 8 gives the viewer on Anhieb a good feeling.
The high-modern, but not cool café officer looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team accompanies the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh Baguettes.
The inhabitants, both 33 years old, have already made a name before opening the tasted café at the lookup as a gastronome: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
The sympathetic café lovers are expecting more audience from their move to Kleve.
Not least also through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stresses.
Rather, the two students here want to address young students as well as the senior and all age classes between them.
Apropos Café lovers.
The sympathetic ownership is behind the coffee genus.
Enjoy the smelling hot braw in the most different variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"For this, a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnight evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not an outstanding fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event, I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event.
That's why events will rather be the exception with us.
"We want to disturb the entire normal operation as little as possible."
The name is: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful surroundings at the resort in Kleve.
The road that grows more and more into a gastronomy miles.
For the joy of many clevers, the guests from near and remote and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus also the café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of gratitude at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival at which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had been happy to come.
In the conciliation site of the "Witteborg" in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonic companionship entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation feast is always the appropriate festival to make honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener welcomed the special award "Singers of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but have also turned some rounds for us, for our warm thanks," said the chairman of the Chore of Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participating in the performances and choir samples by means of activities went to the Chorleiter Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the Chairman Horst Pier-ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler, each with 42 participants.
Place five occupied notenwart Artur Brückner.
A special thankful thing the board addressed to the team of Unitedwirtin Ange Pier-ribbert, who once again had magicated a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" always meets at its regular choir samples on Tuesday at 19.45 a.m. in the uniting room.
"New vocal voices are welcome to us at any time," said Schlotmann.
The UN proclaims new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations starts immediately with the preparation of a number of new objectives to replace the millennium development targets for poverty combating twelve years ago.
In front of the UN Summit for Sustainable Development, which started in Rio de Janeiro at evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of "sustainable development goals" which are intended to replace the millennium targets in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world-political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
In the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on the summit that the time had come to “look beyond the national interests”.
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate a process to be agreed with universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These objectives will be based on our progress from millennium development targets and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not be afraid of implementing this mandate given by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Objectives."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball superlier still has a good atmosphere.
This is why trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt at all.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't know how to taste such a victory," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped trees, Malmon is warning about the show finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex coach.
"In addition, it is necessary to wait to see if there is still reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must at any rate increase compared to the previous occurrences.
Above all things in coverage work and in the shift game, it ended up enormously.
Evidence of chances must also definitely be improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got the head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in view of conflicts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to agree to peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the quantity on Thursday at the capital's independence site.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been one of the worst fights since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a repentant rebel movement that was initially supported by the White Government Rhodesia and later by the Apartheid Government of South Africa in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Convention, she became an opposition party.
Analytics believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a grown conflict, but the recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
For the rapidly growing economy, much is at stake, since the discovery of huge gas in the Northwest coast and coal camps could bring investments from more than 50 billion US dollars of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the next years.
The reigning Frelimo Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo is guilty of each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the latest conflicts by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Highburg Renamos, on 17 October.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo base points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speakers to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the conflicts and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Contrary to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards himself as a "misser" who "will use all its remaining powers to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
However, since Mazanga has been quoted, Renamo has given up the 1992 Peace Agreement.
Towards the FT, he declared that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to take negotiations again and seriously," said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have only contributed little to fixing the tensions that have been fired by a number of conflicts this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) here that collide the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a teacher at the Open University and Mosambik experts.
None of them are good in negotiation and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already explained that she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt of violent movement to achieve concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos' electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, which was founded by a former Renamo member of Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose retirement comes when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the President's office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear about what capacity Renamo has, but she has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, some hundreds of kilometers north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga was reluctant to answer the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good,” said Mazanga.
Instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been concerned about corruption, the swelling progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
“Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “prepics for life”, says a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal force has no chance against smart tricks” and the Artus legend shows how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “to much too wild, too disgusting and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools” and therefore, Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “careful selection” of old-aged works.
“I think it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in authors and teachers who are “excessively educational” children would “completely turn off” because in entertainmental stories the messages would be “awkward”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angel Saxony and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as far as possible.”
The biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and a writer for children is the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be underwhelmed, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again to the courtyard
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement seat in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Frihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic at the very short-term scene game.
From the arrival of the award of honour to his death, Drechbuchautor and Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that was very welcomed under the Cornelia people government.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained cohesions and broke out time from youth to nearing retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then the scene game began, in which Alois Krafczyk once more shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stülecht introduced Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two peppers and "Black Forest Füchsen".
He was not only received by the audience with plenty of applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understanded it incredibly well to move into the role of the sister and gave her in Mimic and Gestik unhearted life.
Between each game scene, the Mühlenbacher farming chapel played suitable musical pieces and rounded the performance.
In order to give the honour of the citizen, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave his honor, who, in representation of the former official Hättich together with a part of the city council, made his presence.
Their arrival then made the three-knight singers that led Hansjakob to the proclamation: "And how beautiful, youth memories will be alive again on my own three-knight period."
With their song "O Jesuslein" they enjoyed the audience in the courtyard as well as the Storchen Day children with their loud "out, out."
His criticism to the official church had expressed Hansjakob at that time as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war.
In the homehouse, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A distressed spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
A lot of applause and many commendative words were made by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of the league remaining of the athletic degraded Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have increased.
Because there should be a wildcard process, then there is now a fewer competitors for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project refuses a application for a possible backing space.
"We will not take part in Wildcard process," said Ex-National player Pascal Roller, who since 2012 set up the concept of a professional club in Hansestadt.
However, a first inhalation was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard process until it is not established that Düsseldorf has no license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until 23 May, upstairs Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic liga suitability.
Until now, the Rhine countries have been refused the license twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.

It reported to the Agency Interfax on the request of non-declared circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it said.

Sharply pipes disturb residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the Halde.
The company has several irons in fire at the location.
In addition to imports of coal, Rhenus Midgard includes wind plant logistics.
Black swallows the stone coal on the warehouse in front of the deck.
Spread or load the coal here if necessary.
For each movement of the envelopes, a scratched warning noise thunders over the area.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, this is far - and so there were already some complaints from people from the urban north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the subjects, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, it is now a matter of keeping the warning signals with technical measures.
He will also put on the open dialogue with its neighbours in the future.
Because Matthias Schrell has something else in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to put on carbon imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 metres deepened form terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can also be completed here.
"This year we want to knock the 3 million tonnes brand," Schrell said.
In addition to the local eon power plant, the import coal is going to power plants in the domestic region.
If the GDF-Suez power plant continues to go to the network, about 5 million tonnes of carbon imports per year will be realistic.
The three shiploaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketballer despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not squeeze the huge optimism in the basketballers of FC Bayern München.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team of Europe in the past two years," Balanced Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on the Thursday evening at title defendant Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball exists also in Munich!
In their first third appearance in the European king class, the Muniches sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not cleared enough in the decisive phases.
At first the guests made the artpiece, a 15-point backstand 13 minutes before the end, to transform into a leadership before Piräus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague Champion, but then made lightweight mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful Werfers of the Munks who had celebrated significant victories in the first two parties against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish tracker targetona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the varieties artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on the Broadway, began to tell the amount of direct jokes in the form of a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fay's innovation was developed, as last at the New York Comedy Festival.
In the life of Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand-up Institute of Carolines, the festival celebrates this year its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headlines started with Carolines and became more and more successful until they were known to appear in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year's event has been held by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy beneficiary event for armies veterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known on rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a Sitcom in the cable TV (the ironic-slipping fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at "Saturday Night Live" and at "Parks and Recreation", although she is most known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slates and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial themes W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralised world of American Comedy.
One of the largest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed as a prestigious TV and film regisseur and as an inofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he managed a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the city hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will appear a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five United Nations vetoes and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
"After years, we have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear dealer was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides would come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game chambers with Machete
Two children have admitted to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12 years old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
On Tuesday, with Machenes and knife armed, they stabbed the 11-year-old and threw the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they had played in a working quarter of football in front of their apartments.
The body was found the following night in Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach place Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half - sister of the younger woman who had taken them, was to say that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the tathergang before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly named a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily delivered to a psychiatric youth institution.
Holders must go to prison.
Due to exploitation of human trafficking, restraint, threat, injury and dangerous body injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgia to three and a half years of prison.
The former Federal Army soldier, who worked as a doormaster after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession under a process agreement.
Thus, in five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts that he sent to the strike after a few weeks against their will.
He opposed himself with violence and threats.
He maintained the revenues of the women who earned him for some years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermined women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who conveyed the women, he brought them to various boardelles in the southwest.
There he left her partly to monitor her revenues.
First, the prosecutor claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus expressed a limited liability, the 33-year-old issued a comprehensive confession.
The court had to hear no more of the injured women.
According to a cripo officer, after a first advertising, at least four further cases of exploitation of human traffic were identified by telephone surveillance measures.
The interrogated discussions had been impressed by high aggression.
In later hearings, the damaged persons had confirmed their torture.
Another Witness who had discovered blue spots throughout the body has not made any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality" which considers violence and exploitation in this metre as normal.
The prosecutor regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has resolved himself from these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues after up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also fallen further on Friday after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report that increases the energy hungry manufacturing sector of China.
The reference raw oil varieties for deliverys in December in Europe in the late morning in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price fall of 5.8 per cent in October.
The large raw oil offer has stressed prices over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Ministry of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrel last week.
Over five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million Barrel.
However, on Friday there were evidence of greater demand by two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth has increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the Brent varieties, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by US-American refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108,58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop-and-fresh directive
On Thursday, a Federal Court of Appeal in the United States blocked the appointment of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-Frisish programme (“continue and searching”) of the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The Second U.S. Court declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until a decision was taken on a appeal to the city.
The judge had sentenced in August that the city violates the constitution with the way the programme for persecution and inquiry is implemented by persons.
The city appealed against its assessment and the commissioned remedies, including the decision to set up a supervisory body to support the police in amending their Directive and the appropriate training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments of the requisite suspension.
The appeal report declared that the judge must be disfellowshipped from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for American Judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partyity; this was partly founded with a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the Court.
The judge had judged, police officers violated the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted in an unappropriate way black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh programme.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in fourths, where most of the controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to stop the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
A oral negotiation on the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-fresh strategy was criticised by a number of civil rights interferencers.
This type of control has been in different forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the official period of the pardelous mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to a constant height of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities were complaining, which developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes in the NYPD stop-and-fresh programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police and influence the way other police Bureaus apply the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would reduce the morals of the police, but not crime, and would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police, which is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been disappeared in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice, which was constitutional, but only the type of implementation of the checks by the NYPD.
From the luck of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oase that succeeds only dreaming camels
With this Beduin knowledge, the first chairman Wolfgang Her described the history and fascination of the "helping hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman of Henne reported detailedly about the work of the association.
In 2004 he was the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and the Gynäkologe Henne conducted numerous operations on several trips on the site.
During the talks, pictures of the operations were shown on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The United Nations desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, former OB of Nagold, had proposed to provide this vehicle with a photovoltaic location and now plans to work in advisory function in the association, according to her.
In 2008, the room Ei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital station in Socogim, an affliction district on the edge of the capital, in the record period of nearly one week.
Her also mentioned a new Mother-Kid Hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which the birth hospital is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medicine, such as her, for example acceleration against Burn-out.
Due to the political disturbances in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many medicines came to Germany to visit here in various areas.
In addition, containers are regularly sent to Africa with material, such as medical devices, medicines, compound materials, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
The co-initiator Hans-Joachim moisture itself delivered abundantly local coloring by telling from Mauritania of converted Mercedes vehicles to the mobile goat set and the experiences of the homes of musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of audit as a young Member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget through the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it wasn't far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson claimed to introduce “telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation” in attempting to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Prime Minister for the Interior Charles Clarke.
Advocate Andrew Edis QC explained to the court at Old Bailey, News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special advisor” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed them, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court heard.
“In the opinion of the prosecution, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to hit them for fresh acts, but one that people like to face with a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, "If he knew about it."
Germs about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by the feature redaction of NotW, as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't disappear your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The researchers also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time the researchers ran, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, the former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following contents: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former minister David Blunkett.
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he had been lied with Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks argued to have sworn to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In fact, the French football will, in protest against the planned tax, go through the first strike since 1972.
An explanatory meeting ends indefinitely.
In conflict with wealth taxes, the government and the Profi-Fussball in France, after a failure to make an explanation meeting, have manoeuvred into a baggage.
President François Hollande received and listened to their complaints on Thursday in the Pariser Élysée-Palast.
However, he refused to refund the football from the planned 75% tax on income from more than one million euros per year, which all the companies in the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike that was announced at the end of November will now be carried through, the head of the Profiklubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The playdays set between November 29 and December 2 in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 thus fall out.
Changing: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," opened Mayor Jens Häußler the Civil Information Event on the Survival Protection Concept in Gechingen.
Some 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns, and to introduce ideas.
Hälser pointed out: "The final decisions will be taken by the members of the municipality."
The flood that Gechingen met unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an incredible event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, says the patrons.
A river area survey had been conducted with the neighbouring Aidlingen community, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of so many cultivated lands is the goal," said the chiefs.
Based on the planning of protection against a weather service, according to the German weather service, is statistically expected every 100 years of flooding water.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% surplus.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The mass of water that had caused significant damage in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved," said drums.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereas the municipality can expect national subsidies of about 70 per cent.
However, haters pointed out that there is only the promotion if a overall concept is being implemented.
This is why the Community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An emerging planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the concept of protection presented in the municipality last week (we reported) provides local measures in the fluid of Irm from the tribal valley.
Following the presentation of the cross-water protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to submit their claims.
Among other things, it was questioned why no longer dams and refugees were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist in the design of the designated engineering agency of Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economic solution is to be found, says Joachim forest of forest and corbe.
Untreatment was prevailing in the land of the old place, who, even in normal rainfall, endurely suffered from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is familiar with the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, hummers pointed out that the directives for channel systems are different than for flood protection and this cannot be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be tolerated.
The greater dimension of the wastewater channels would swallow millions.
Heavy injury after collision
On the early Friday afternoon, on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf, two car drivers were severely injured during a frontal crash.
The police immediately locked the road completely, but at first, they could not say anything about the accident.
However, there are various witness statements that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, where the woman was so toughly sticked that the firearm needed little one half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck.
At first, the actual cause of accident remained unclear.
Both disadvantages came to nearby hospitals.
The route remained about two hours full.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazingly the relatives in the outer: the steaking eyes, the bart, the high pan.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is understood with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets, which are clearly valid in their own country.
Some titles are published in the Heyne Publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, safety wheat and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read himself like a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added his brain.
He already understood that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "bread Runner" problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This history is now particularly significant.
The "Minority Report" comes from the year 1956, it fragrances the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", that is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks terrifyingly like ours, mutants look into the future - and the police approach.
"We acknowledge individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the Authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "In our society there are no grave criminals, we have a criminal camp full of Pesudocriminals." They read time flows.
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented.
Dick's story seems like the blaupause for the anti-terror law and the hearing noise of the NSA.
Antizipation of the attack: Obamas also works drones philosophy and praxis.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of the police regrets that there is no more violence, the military controls the everyday life - and what is left by the State.
Then the surveillance will be monitored and transmitted to a future crime.
The system is turning through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Take mistakes and victims not only in purchase, but build up on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means always getting closer to the truth.
Exclamation of a sea ferry about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. Secret Service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. Spencer Fair for Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal lawyer could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old person personally in Russia, the Agency informed Interfax.
Previously, the Green-Bundesday Deputy Hans-Christian Strøbele had met last night as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures reinforce business paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police hubschrauber fled deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, it should photograph the roof of the US Outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance entities and the action led to a exchange of words between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again in September argued that the United States did not use opportunities for a foreign spy, “to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profit.”
However, since Edward Snowden, who became the Whistleblower, has started publishing his filling horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business heads are no longer sure whether they can take the director into account.
Reports that the American National Security Agency spys out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtains data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought companies paranoia to a new highest level for state surveillance.
The phase to run brought the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkels was addicted to the phone, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can come into vision, business management will certainly also be potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US Secret Services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"German must wake up," says Oliver Green, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now represented a nearly as high risk as China when it comes to industrial spionage and data stealing, such a survey published by the consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents covered by Snowden, there has not been any evidence that the United States has transmitted the operating secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern about the lack of certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce their dependency on the USA.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
On the Bundestag, we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"This is not how this works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything to the IT industry.
Yet, the range and technical reaffirmations of the US spy authorities discovered by the Snowden discoveries have shocked companies who had previously seen the largest risk of spying in China.
The Cloud Computing is a major change because European corporate leaders are now more aware of the fact that data stored in the United States are subject to the legal procedure there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, rejected the discovery of US data mining activities with Prism about 10 percent of the non-owned members of the US plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Vice-President of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that weren't yet there a year ago – she is: Where are my data stored and you can guarantee that these are physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German corporate leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they knew, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at any price.
That economic spionage takes place is not a surprise.
That's always true.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the Chemical Company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate management is usually not crying about the countermeasures taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been involved in the fact that taking a free USB stick on a fair or the unobserved leave of a laptop in the hotel room is not easy to say.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the Executive Board of Auto Manufacturers Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid handles when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handys are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attackable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective nisches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to protect operating secrets effectively from unauthorised access”, the BVT warns in a report.
The United States warns their own companies against economic spionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, two of the countries used to purchase economic data from hacking were organized in the US National Intelligence Estimates in February France, Russia and Israel behind China.
A member of the Board of Directors of a German Blue-Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French German Secret Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The Secret Services know very accurately that, even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, all countries spy out their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery tour that man can do," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: The Retro look has kept the move back.
It starts with the wedding clothes.
White is Muss, best covered or in cream.
In front of them, the many roasted and sticky dresses are closed, often with a slide, on the back, they go down the back and often end in a sleeve.
However, the spirits are divorced, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house of clothing müller.
In men, the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be selected cream coloured or brown combinations.
It is important to select the local, explained.
Youthless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain made attention to its own offer in the board.
Then who wants to go ahead with the truck, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
"But kiss are also popular for boyfriends' divorces," he says.
Romantic is also requested for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Foto" - thus recording series at special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothing, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, which guests can enjoy stylish entertainment.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable festival.
Hundreds of successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the hundred-from-bitz were successful on a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in candle with two dogs; with his dog Sandy, he reached 94 points in the class beginner and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley, he took it with 87 points to place twelve.
Susi Hopp, with her Woody in Class 1, set up the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled ringer matte at his high school tour, are convinced that their son was murdered, the lawyer of the family explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a fairly set mat, behind the tribüne in the school tour hall.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old doubts.
“You are convinced that their son was murdered,” explained Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died as the sheriff concluded.
“You believe that it requires every logic to violate the laws of physics and the healthy human understanding,” says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being cursed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their Son.
"Your son went to learn to school and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation about Johnson's death, since a number of important questions were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died because of the consequences of a “position-related dilution”.
A second autopsy, however, caused another cause of death, says Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he will be commissioning the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in southern Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all monitoring videos that the detectors have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video records contained evidence of how he died.
Publishing allergy policies for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of directives for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. Government, as the number of educational children with food allergy increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergy.
The spread of food allergy among children has increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The Guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergy and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin – the most commonly used auto-injecting of the epiPen brand – to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the Federal States have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something pressed on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "my tongue crushs."
Parents of intersexual children can choose "undetermined" sex
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children who were born with non-clear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned to star male or female.
According to the new law, parents must no longer declare sex to such children, but may indicate "undefined" or "not defined" on the birth document.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overhaast decisions concerning operations for gender allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination between sexual people.
A intersexual person said, according to BBC years later, "I am not man or woman."
I'm staying the flicking work created by doctors, embroidered and filled with scars.
It is estimated that one out of 2,000 children each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group falling under the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, chemoquids (ears or heads) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise you to use the best available gender allocation information if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before you decide – if any – for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “climbing for a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
You can take a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are gay.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but because of their biological constitution, which is not merely male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These qualities were demonstrated in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statue, priorities of sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgender persons in professional life, as well as to the extent of injury, violence and prejudice crime.
Not with the gender image, boys now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or “third sex”.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the first “generationless” person worldwide, after a court had allowed the lifelong preservation of a “non-defined” sex status.
Deutsche Ausweis neben M and W will have a third assignment, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of Interior.
In the neighbouring France, sex themes are still controversial, so a news report to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the “Christian theory” should be removed from school books.
The US-American Website Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, with the reason: "If the world is distorted into a new state where the sex represents a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distort two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to baby zone, she would find it better if babys were assigned a gender at birth.
“The parent’s behavior is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your own child,” she said the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children who were born with both male and female sexes were called Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, the medicine viewed the gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilded.
However, now the ethical foundations of a surgery are doubted, after now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, you called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genetics is backed to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who felt that the gender was formal.
He interacted with the genes and hormones of a child, arguing, social and environmentally-related attacks, such as parents, and interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and acted in such a way as whether a person regarded himself as male or female.
However, in a case known under the title “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been distinguished in a precious circumcision, to castricate the child and also remove his heads and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion, which he was not,” said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public who are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, born with XY male chromosomes, but two-defined genitals.
The doctors were unaware of whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satising life” as a man.
So his external organ and heads were removed surgically shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
He was 12 years old and received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressive and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical documents.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, whereby his body could not produce testosterone enough to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosteron injections and was removed from his breasts.
The surgery has made him unfruitable.
Today he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be seen as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Advocates for Informed Choice jurisdiction in California, ensures that the German law “courses to stamp and stigmatise” can be encouraged.
“Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make rapid decisions and to assign a ,not defined',” she explained.
We fear that this will favour intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization supports the Australian law, 'that enables adults to recognize as the third sex.'
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex,” she explained.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at that time.
When they are grown, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a pittsburger brustradiologist who has a daughter with a sexual distinction and supports hundreds of others in a self-accession group, says that the German law “advocate” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptive effect of the target cells for testosterone.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no egg sticks.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is unfruitable, she hopes to be able to get a child by adoption or a limb.
“The law gives parents space so that they do not have to make decisions overriddenly,” said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make various tests and to clear things and thus give them time before they write “manly” or “woman”.
In this way, everything is okay – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents' happiness.
And you don't have to overhaast a surgery that can no longer be undoed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents relocate because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shot from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when they were shot from a car.
On Thursday evening, in Genthin, the criminals probably had fired an air pressure weapon to a group of children.
That's what the police told in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The killers also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The Criminal Police detected it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back to a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice for egg-casting children, which cast them against house phases.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and the eggs were immediately removed, there should be no damage to matters.
In the city area, some SylvesterBalls have also been burned, but there has not been any matter damage here.
An inhabitant of the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was embedded with clothing paper and his cycling blends were disposed of.
Until the police arrived, however, the man discovered his cycling blends in the immediate vicinity of everyone, why the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes of public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spins?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spine at the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinning phobie, but the concern that, in the age, the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be handled, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, a book by her appeared on the subject 'Happy living in age - What form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in the age', she begins to tell.
When she moved over 20 years ago with her husband to the maisonette apartment, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that it is one of the few people who are confronted with the topic 'Beauty at age'.
Most of them are expelled as long as they can.
It's always going to be the other ones, "says she's smelting.
Only if the pressure of suffering is really high, you think about it.
'Then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architectin presents 17 living models for a self-defined living at age.
'Which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who could afford the retirement of age in Tuscany or Bretagne should always consider that he could become sick.
And, 'without good knowledge of the language of the country, you also unite in Dolce Vita', the expert in the book says to consider deployers.
Its models include classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often quoted pensioner WG.
In the age, everyone has so their ticks and Macken
'For me, such a community would be nothing,' she means with an eye wings.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen.
'In the age, you just need to get back rooms,' so Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude a senior community.
This must then be different from in the classic students' WG.
And sometimes you just want to have your rest, she believes.
With this view, it is not alone in the capital of the country at least.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life at the age of the capital.
Your service advises people about the topic 'Become Older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also purchase uncomforts and restrictions only in order to remain in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Foundation of Goods Tests.
Today there are many possibilities to make the house or the apartment barrier free.
Ries recommends that all who are employed with the age-time restructuring of their home or home should first inform themselves thoroughly and not commit the first best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the old-aged reconstruction.
Even in the apartment, it can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior architectin is clearing up.
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment for age and thus free of barrier, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase within the apartment, which also plunged with stairs to the door of the apartment would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before she moves, she greys more than before the spin on her apartment door.
U.S. will continue to persecute Snowden in criminal law
The United States has not changed their attitude to the former U.S. Secret Service colleague Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be charged with unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, if he had to commit a criminal proceedings in the United States, the speaker of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Nor would the recent statements of Snowden change it.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green Polician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed the fact that there are strong statements about a parliamentarian and not a German government member.
Secret Services Sheller Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation cleared.
This was explained by the former NSA staff seeking by the United States in an unadadressered letter that was published by the Green Politician Hans-Christian Strøbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and led to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the General Bundesanwalt.
The letter has the following words after a translation distributed by Strobbles:
To the Competents
I was asked to write to you about your investigation on mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I was previously contractual or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became witnesses of systematic violations of my government, which caused me to act by moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum that gives me the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged from resonance to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and high officials - including the United States - have assessed the disclosures of a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not guilty of any accounting as a public service.
These spionage disclosures drew many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits of this knowledge for society are increasingly clarified and the risks incurred at the same time have been significantly reduced.
Although the results of my efforts were proven positive, my government still treats this as a violation of faithfulness and seeks to criminalize political opinion and put it under charge.
Yet, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abstain from this violent attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are faced, I will be able to participate in the responsible explanation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, particularly in the case of the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.

Children's garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former children's garden in the garden street has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipality agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "appropriate" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," pointed Maier.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were allocated.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former children's garden.
It is right for the mayor that Winterlingen has transferred responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and therefore no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, as to heat, look for the garden and clear the road.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music association Hammerijenbach provides a place concert on the terrace of the hosthouse Hammer.
When Dirigent Bianca Willmann lifts the bracket at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich's musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the musical pieces.
Honeck thanked everyone who had helped to successfully manage the first music hockey.
Report: Obama campaign thought to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors of President Barack Obama have in secret considered to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, says the New York Times.
The discovery is the most noticeable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long expected work over the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is a copy of the next published book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president's top consultants had carried out "wide group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011" in order to find out whether Obama's disappearing hope of re-election would look better if he would let him fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and of the White House, in particular the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the survey values of exchange of former foreign minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the closest consultants of the president – including Daley, former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and former leading consultant of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
The 'Double Down' claims that Daley was at the top of its efforts to exchange bids despite their 'severe personal relationships', before one finally decided against such a treasure after the data showed that Clinton's Candidor would 'not significantly improve the chances of Obamas'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually thought to replace prayers by Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things to be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
One must remember that the President had terrible inquiries at that time, so we thought, “For God’s will, what do we do?”
While Daley referred to the investigations as "required care", Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign for re-electing was a considerable effort to find out whether such a train was paying for the elections.
“In campaigns not so much money is spent for surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something,” said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his damal boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he does not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious," the former Staff Chief admitted that it had been "possibly" that Obama had known about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political synderings had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama had no knowledge of the investigations about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
"Maybe," said Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet Service implement email secret technically similar to the traditional mail?
The conception of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care of creating a stable foundation for a hearing-safe letter change.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail corresponds to an open mail card rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an e-mail to "Benni", then are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna's e-mail client or browser will first send the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server will send the content to the provider that uses Benni.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read through the network on their way?
Most mails are read several times by software robosters on the road.
At the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail brings a damage programme as an annex.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the provider checks whether it is a disadvantaged and unwanted spam mail that is deleted at least in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place for context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can show related links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading an e-mail is extremely small.
But theoretically, that is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to capture or take note of emails.
This includes possible illegal delay actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With a OpenPGP default encryption, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that not even without anything can be detected who has communicated with who.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
In the main privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google, according to an examination of Convios Consulting from August 2013, only play a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had last fallen, GMail was able to make it clear by Google.
Mother worsened in the forest and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay their pension and care.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
At first, he disgushed the death of 89-year-olds, then he struck the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Thus the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time it was noticed that no more medicines were needed for the nursing mother.
The detectives told the retired that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to detect.
It found out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last taken care of them.
The 67-year-old eventually admitted the death of his mother.
A obduction, according to the police, did not give evidence of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first lighting ice – using Quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the sea beasts and created a glorious leakage.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on Quallen and Chinese scientists were convinced to produce the lighting protein artificially.
The ice cream responds when eating with the tongue, thus lifting the pH value in the protein and triggering the lighting.
Chris explains that the food egg reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you leak, the better it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value rises and the ice lights.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the bulb fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes great for it.
Charlie's experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual taste directions, including beer, cheese, beef and gold.
But his newest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light breakdown caused by the ice crystals consisting of ice cream; but I suppose we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescenting properties of a puppy that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still after six playdays without any point in the Handball Association Liga.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
This game starts the season new for us.
"I hope we'll finally have our head free," Eller's behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has available his complete box.
The world also sets on the pace game like us.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase in coverage, which has left everything else than a safe impression.
After the first season's victory against Nordhorn, Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is clearly relaxing.
The game was of course a home number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to lay down in Morsum to start a series.
Missing Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Jugendly Joost Windßuß, which is active with double-playing rights at the A-Jugend-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates its seasonal debt.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game is supposed to stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweetness, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment from sweets, and I guess I will not do so this year.
But, according to statistics, I'm a black sheep with regard to Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be precisely – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweetness, costumes and decorations, according to the US-American association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every hallowee again is the trend values.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the $6,9 billion issued US, according to the NRF.
In this year, exciting unlived objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wear sexy clothes, they can now also organize seductive food such as pizza, Hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-World Spacemen will create it in the Instagram Feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, says the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
With regard to sweetness, we are not circumcisable.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million kilos of chocolate gels, luts, Bonbons and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Ministry of Trade 41 million people who drag through the quarter with the words "Sweet or Saures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't pretend – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilos of it are sold by Halloween, says the National Association of the Sweet Product Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing is more of Halloween than houses where it's funny.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is still in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognised spookhouses in the United States that achieve $500 million sales, says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you are just pinching into the pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and then one of the guy you stand on leaves a comment like “near face expression”.
But let's finally get to the carpets.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the big curbis when we were kids, and cutting a crubis lather is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made up from a small time.
Fortunately, the "Baby in Kürbis" Trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up with cutting the curbis up and not sitting in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for crusties, says the US Census Bureau.
The cubis lathers, which are slowly rotting in the front garden, are likely from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilos of crubits were harvested.
If you want to do the right points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something nice from their 921 kilos heavy curbis.
Living fire in Helm Rights: Rescue forces bergenkohled body
On the late Thursday night, the fire force had to back out in the Helm Rights.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches in the night for Friday fire.
The rescue forces save a cold body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a colded body in a three-family house in a fire in the Helm Rights.
Whether it's about a inhabitant, it's still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it had burned at the ground floor of the house.
When the fire force arrived, the flames already hit out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other inhabitants were not at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
First of all, the building is no longer inhabitable.
At first, the exact cause of fire was not clear.
Germany's largest country church has started an offensive to advertise for the profession of the pastor.
The background is a possible parish deficiency: The Evangelical-Lutherian National Church Hannover expects that the number of its currently about 1,800 pastors will be half by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future,” said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily course itself.
With Burphia, the Church of the State has for the first time assigned a pastor in full to enthusiasm to young people for theology study.
At present, less and less young people after the abiture decide to study theology.
Burphia results in the process of excursion: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my agenda, and I can put my attention there where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a sailor.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well of them.
Surely more in the free economy is paid, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This is the case with young people from today, who are not only career, but a mentally filled work.
According to the National Church, which includes three quarters of Niedersachsen, about 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thin perimeters such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to arrange for young people and invite prominents who have studied theology to do so.
The theology study offered a broad training.
You can even become the Federal President.
Land Rover Rally series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point gorts as well as a free-speaking facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with care for Bowler-Works engineers and logistic support up to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tension and adventures as well as a accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format creates new possibilities to experience different Rally disciplines in the United Kingdom and abroad and to prepare new ones for the strategies and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge-waves – this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day at the Defender Challenge in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firewear for the rescue of a dog who sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock predominant in a rock break
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in rock break in her miserable situation
Firemen sailed down on rock walls and saved the dog from the safe death
The firewear succeeded in bringing a dog in safety, which was mounted on a 15 meters high predominance in a rock wall.
The nine-month old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 belonging to the dog, came to the rock break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing dog and published auxiliary calls in social networks when after the small traffic accident she had escaped into the rock break.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who performed his dog saw the strangled Ruby on the 15 meters high cut in stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and sailed down to the rescue of Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
She was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was as steep frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then eated a few dog kitchens.
That was a pretty unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge happiness.”
There was the possibility that she was very severely injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian, but he did not detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Being the salvation was terrifying.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaust had become too great and it had been collapsed, it would probably be crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop-star said that she worked as a background singer to hungers' song "Old Habits The Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old smoker tonight, and that “he had baked me when I was 18 years old.”
She added, “This is a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In an explanation, a representative of Jagger, 70, on Thursday, said that he “categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added, "Maybe she has confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.

George Kerevan: European deflection gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror history of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a precondition for EU membership.
This provides the label for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a boundary secured with stachel wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, expectingly, did not play a role in the headings.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States are often correcting their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-observation for Brussels would only be a small concession in contrary to what you really want from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one who has come so in the years that she already looks like a fossil: the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” end at least 40 years ago.
A interesting point is lost in the constant repeating of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pepper?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the large, after the war, plan for Europe's association has been taken into account.
The Eurocrisis has officially died of the Europe project.
Overall in the EU, parties win on grounds that are enemy to the EU or wish to throw the euro on board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Party was able to set up alternatives for Germany – only this year – for nearly five million votes in the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively distribute the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been home resistance to the plan of creating a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
As a result of the strict saving policy in connection with the compulsory jacket to which the national economy is required by maintaining the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The crisis of the euro has little to do with the cause of excessive budget deficit for national governments – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has attached its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluation of local currency, Southern Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage toward Germany.
The only option is to reduce wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
The current etat and monetary problems are a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives - a code for the subsidy of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - the European industry pays the double for electricity and the four-fold for gas compared to the United States.
This is a shameful cost disadvantage, as we already saw in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American screw gas.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the unique cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elites of France viewed the EU as a vehicle that could be used to keep Germany in chess and to raise Paris on a height of eyes with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gate for political legitimacy and has pressed Europe on its own economic policy, which has to fight the struggled French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, legally directed, EU enemy front National has just won a decisive refusal and thus referred to the dominant socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to form an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and that is very good possible – then such a block could first dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go on: in the future, the growing resentiveness against the EU and the common currency will be together to eliminate the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (soviet) nations' which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to be distant from this project in the hope of smuggling into the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific area shows that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's Scotland staying with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can sign.
I suppose Scotland could be very well driving in a looser European association, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to make Norway equal and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against saving policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) reductions that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to be responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for an independence only to force a saving policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Faster grown up
Afro-American and Historical girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age companions, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean pubertity yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic fatness is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early pubertity is less impressed in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etherridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family themes.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame hair when she is seven or eight years old?
At the Annual Conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, this week, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is not a sign of rapid puberty,” explained Kaplowitz.
Apparent advertisements of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair as well as body smell, are shown in girls earlier.
Yet there was only a slightly shift in the age of Menarche (the occurrence of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“If the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the menarchy”, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Fried Pubertät in Girls: The Essential Advisor for dealing with this frequent problem.”
Time is the most exact test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it is “premature” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shift before eight years of age.
In most cases the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can closely monitor.
In faster advances, tests may be indicated by an endikronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and the defence of other consequences: premature ageing of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medicine or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant about medicines, but he admits: “The oppression of pubertity can make behaviour problems and the feelings of girls milder, different from their age companions.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygiene side,” said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," remembers a woman whose daughter had her days at ten years.
Even though there were first signs and we had spoken about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causing causes.
Boys come to pubertity like girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premises are the epidemic of fatness.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, making a link between body fat and entry into the pubertät.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a part.
In this country, Afro-American and Historical girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age companions.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, a early puberty of all kinds of things seems to be influenced, from economic conditions over the climate to the genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are growing the face and shame hair before, the trend to a full-scale former puberty is not as impressive as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shame hair is even widespread in babies and babies.
“We need to be careful how we identify the real beginning of the puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their child doctor how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected”, said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers are fighting in the face of large orders about seating width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class at long distance flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those to which airlines are most endeavoring, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims in the latest airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus requested a industry standard this week, which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide this.
The contest comes at a time when the aircraft builders are contesting to sell even larger versions of their two-motored long-range flights and expect record contracts at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the plane is designed – in particular whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results specified to provide the new “Mini-Jumbo” design.
Boeing claims that his modernized “777X” fits 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and allow 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 persons in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane giants often share over technical details by advertising in the special press.
Now Airbus appeals before the Dubai Airshow, where 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertising that could be the beginning of a new advertising war, and money donors showed a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title, "Will you accept that?"
“Boeing suggests long-term flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props,” says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
In view of changed dietary habits, people become thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent, according to the data of the U.S. Ministry of Health.
The number of male average Americans in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival holds a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body range of the freshly baptized "Jet Set" was smaler.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing depends on Airbus' figures on the seat measurements and says that it is not in the absence of the manufacturers to decide how airlines form the balance between air tariffs and installations.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“There is really going to be flexibility for airlines so that they can do what they think they need to do in order to be successful”, explained the airline expert Kent Craver by Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, there is more ellenbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can affect turnovers.
The contest is behind a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars by list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe export balance.
As Reuters reported in July for the first time, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat at their latest two-motor long-line designs as the market leader in this segment, the 365-seats Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements on the results depend partially on the comparison of the 777X with their ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for machinery currently used with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore quets more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products”, says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analytists say that full cabins with ten seats per row of existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could be related to cheaper air fares.
“Eighteen inches of seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabins, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world traveling Jet sellers are even carrying band measurement in order to take care of the establishment in competition.
Even if they commend the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a high level of design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seats rows, but has not sold any, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats for some Jets on the gangs.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation of a new industry standard is likely to be suspended, but could deduct from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking the garous
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could corrupt the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mouse from nicotine disease for a lifetime.
Before testing at humans, further tests are needed, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine disease is stronger than these approaches,” says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information on the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant power of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, so that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice with nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination would have taken a "out," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibodies that they were expensive and inpractical.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could, if he was absolutely sure, be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine.
But more likely, smokers would use him to stop.
“They know that when they start smoking again, they are no longer enjoyable because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to put down the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi strives to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the Labour Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the state of corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister strives to have changed the rules for maritime detention on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covered participation in three lands on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations on the question whether Obeid has affected various State Ministers to prolong paach contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without procurement after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi was aware of obeids' interest in the plots after Tripodis former vice-president, Lynne Ashpole, had declared the same on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed on public tendering for the charter contracts.
The patriarchs were opposed and wanted longer runtimes.
In 2009, the charter contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which entered $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Harbour Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially stated public tendering.
However, it rejects the amendments to the requests of Obeid which, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged the government to restructure the pact arrangements.
One of the ICAC's telephone documents showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a managing officer who had switched to the Harbour Ministry after working under Obeid in the fishing authority.
"Where was the subject of the development of commercial complaint schemes discussed in this telephone discussion?", asked Vice-President Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighting aircraft attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked Thursday night a target in the Syrian port of Latakia, confirmed a governing government staff against Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least two times this year, Israel has already carried out air attacks on rocket supply in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a ‘examination test’
In the framework of extended measures, the Government considers a "reality test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
If the test was introduced, it would come through a criterion to be used to prevent the use of 457 for occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the accession of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the laboratory party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because these could be seen as insult by the neighbors of Australia.
“Loudly strong statements such as, foreigners are supposed to set up behind” and, ‘Australiers first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times where trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this said that white workers should be protected – and if some people in the region are taking an echo of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal covers twelve measures once proposed by former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who lived yesterday on talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes which are still considered.
If the ‘equity criterion’ is taken over, a person requesting a visa may be examined in such a way that ‘the application is real in the cases where the applicant is related to the holder or any relevant person of the supporting company’.
In addition, companies could be obliged to make account of the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past, companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-long asylum probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for since his father died on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring the United Kingdom closer together".
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Great Britain and its cities closer together.”
We move forward with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
However, it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scotian State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "The present announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called on to use "unmistakably" for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed railway connection offers the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time the economic force also provides Scotland an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates advantages for all and supplements the link Glasgow-Edinburgh, which is already planned by the Scottish government.
I look forward to review the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Provisions on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian passengers must also continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the USA to resolve the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, view or play videos on their devices during critical phases of flight, if they are in “air mode”.
During the most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books at start and landing.
Australian societies observe the decision to which the US airlines have to make a lot of work, but do not follow direct plans to amend their rules.
The Air Safety Authority also stated that the notification would be viewed, but underlined that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices still apply in critical phases of flight in Australia.
“The CASA has no specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft at the moment” was declared.
The subject is subject to provisions which, according to air carriers, must maintain safety at any time and passengers follow the safety instructions provided by cabin staff.
Virgin has already led discussions with the CASA about the extension of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that you are open for changes, but they should be initiated by the lawyer.
“We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer (threadless entertainment) during the flight,” said one speaker.
Qantas explained that the current regulations will remain in the future.
“Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used at start and landing, and we do not have any plans to change that,” the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US-American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations which can benefit passengers, and we will be sure to see the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in US-American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their planes can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbags programs and customer training.
“After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use more portable, easy electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases when the crew is in a bad perspective, the passengers will be instructed to turn off the devices during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavyer equipment be placed safely under the seat or in the chairs above the seats at start and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, colleague BVB supporters had provided with light rockets for horrible scenes in Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the football bandesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spenic acoustic, which lived to the viewer just before the top of the federal league game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Hearing were mostly the guest fans with their singings.
On the other hand, the Southern tribe, where the most faithful - and loud - BVB fans were standing, initially presented extraordinary silence: no songs, no slaughter calls.
The pod of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint firement, remained unoccupied.
And on the front of the tribe, a large flag with a label of "Section Stadion prohibition" wound alone.
Only as a gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB player, entered the place, burned up short-term joy.
When his teammates followed, there were loud songs and hurt shales - but not at all.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern tribe, there was nothing.
Also that Stadion speaker Norbert Dickel once again recorded the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide celebrations.
Only five minutes before the pitch, the Capo climbed his pod - and the hand-takable tension to date was exhausted in a loud scream, as Dickel as usual the atmosphere of the gangs in the stadium.
Lastly, as always, the southern tribe was on line - and finally was here again as used to the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when with the pepper from the southern tribe came the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" was everything again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had hit light rockets into the viewers and fired on the place - and almost gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was peeped late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and they believe that Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultramove," announced the BVB Boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid it," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnology.
In addition, the Ultras has been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, Watzke says, the BVB will fix a sanction until the end of the next week.
"This is going to be incredible," assured Watzke.
You may be excited how the reactions to the southern tribe then occur.
Pfandhouses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pand house in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a couple of ear rings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about EUR 1,730) each month as an administrative employee and also works her husband, the monthly family income does not yield, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South-East Asia – where the debt of households grows – is so large that valueMax, where she made her exchange, this week became the third pfand house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The placing of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favourable as an uncertain bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhouses in Singapore require an effective 17 percent annual interest rate, which is only less than 15.4 percent, demanding by the United Overseas Bank, a local credit provider with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pand houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of the creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are faster than for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are addressed to pandhouses, after families feel the pressure of increasing life-keeping costs and increasing budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium income are looking for pandhouses to compensate for the difference in stunting economy.
This week, the Rating Agency called standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising mortgages, a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product, as the Agency considers.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, an increase of 60 per cent still in 2008.
People's businesses are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday the data showed a remaining export weakness and a delay in consumer demand.
“In the final effect this means that in view of increasing costs, people in the middle to the lower segment (income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, Economy at CIMB, a Malaysic Bank.
Historical peaks in the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend for the placing of personal items, as people use the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are located in the 200 pand houses of the city state of gold.
People say: “The gold price looks good, let's plug our grandmother's gold chain and get back next month.”
The largest Thai pand house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20-percentage customer growth in its branches in the last few months.
The growth in the pfand business is so strong that valueMax, the operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, so Yes Lee Ching, manager of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars that took it this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors have been hit in the cross fire because of high interest rates, Yes says that pandhouses not only offer more favourable interests than other suppliers, but also did not directly increase debts.
"Customers are borrowing items they already own, and the liquid personal values do not increase budgetary training," she explains.
The pfand lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pand loans are in financial difficulties.
Wealthy people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to preserve gold bars and Rolex clocks for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
To us customers come from every social layer.
“These includes wealthy people who lend something for a business or an investment on the short term, or small companies who have to bridge over paces in the cash flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they also just need very fast money.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Discoverer Edward Snowden has a principal interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly growing NSA-Speicher Fare.
Following the presentation of the Hans-Christian Strøbele Green-Bundesday Assembly, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former Secret Service staff would proclaim at a German prosecutorship or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complex legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health
The Australian government is under the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of over $325 million in Australia for the Tasmanian health sector in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “indelay” measures to prevent a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Financing for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has prepared a emergency rescue package that we believe concerns the unique challenges faced by the state”, said Plibersek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency aid for elections.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey star, residues are to be removed.
In addition, there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better retirement after stationary stays, medical training, psychological health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas of which clinic staff affected me said they were the best way to improve the Tamanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister was on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-headed Commission is set up and is intended to ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would only be low if “the real reforms do not accompany them that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Regardless of this, he praised the government for reacting to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aid will contribute greatly to taking the public health system of the state from the list of concerns,” said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these elections will largely legalize the recent cuts.
However, the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is just a "pflaster solution".
“We are therefore in the situation today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government will take nearly a half billion dollars out of the system and rip the Commonwealth 300 million in and then do as if the good news is.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the salvation package for additional bureaucracy was issued.
Guillaume Nicloux' Adaption of the Roman of Denis Diderot convinced with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also more severe than necessary.
The act playing in France of the 1760s tells the dramatic story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent by their family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelness of an extremely sadistic upper and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never shines out in lustfulness or sensational desire – and its problem lies in it.
The celebrity of seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a peasant bitch for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its potential for the manufacture of chemistry weapons, so a surveillance group
Syria destroyed important plants for the manufacture of chemistry weapons and gitft gas ammunition, the global monitoring group for chemistry weapons declared on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious conflicts near one of the locations where toxic substances are probably stored.
Similarly on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed three years ago since the start of the civil war.
The announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came one day before the date on
1 November, which the Damascus Organization established in the Hague to destroy all plants for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to make 'inoperable', including all machinery for mixing chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at destruction of all Syria's chemical weapons until mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including sennep gas and nervous gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday battles took place in the city of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemistry weapons and warehouses here, as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights established in Great Britain informed.
The group of activists who pursues the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria explained that 120.296 people died on Thursday.
There are 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the Army of President Bashar Assad, 18 678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militants.
Similarly, among the dead there are 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee from the country.
Assads troops have been fighting against the rebells in Saffira for weeks, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights underline the danger of the chemical arms inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a magical civil war.
According to the OPCW, who cooperates closely with the United Nations, the team is “non convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced their destruction."
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the places specified by Damascus.
As a result of security concerns, the inspectors said that the visit of two institutions was not possible.
On Thursday the OPWC stated that the two locations were "released... and the objects of the Chemical Arms Programme there were transferred to other devices referred to inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the place in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
“I take the hat before the braveness and courage you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization”, said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunitian Muslim Rebels in this civil war have fought against Assad's government and their security forces, many of the Alavians, a division of Shitian Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the Observatory Group, Rami Abdurrahman, said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Wrath of judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died at the bomb attack in Bali in 2002 reacted angryly on the judgment of the last incentive who was put before the court, since Umar Patek believed he should be shot on a statutory basis.
Patek, who was nearly ten years away as one of the most seeking persons in South East Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bomb attack.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A debt claim was also made in a number of terrorist charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia at the weekend of 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a lifelong penalty, even if it could have been called "demolition Man" for the man who, because of his reputation, was known as a master bomber.
The decision raised painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin colonel Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators caused almost ten years ago.
With tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any other grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made like the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small loader that was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide attacker had an exploded backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times, while he was hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Terror Cell of Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the blood bath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before all others.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds hurt, isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber standing before the court.
He was almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where US forces almost four months later killed the former al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiation, a FBI agency stated that secret service reports had given the evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between South Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown regret for the amount of suffering he has added to other people.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with Memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers are now able to use electronic equipment in aircraft (but they do not have phone calls)
From departure to landing, flight travellers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and using the view of movies, but not telephone, so the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the respective airline, FAA colleague Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training manuals of the aircraft staff and the rules for degrading the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the condition of the plan, we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices,” the FAA announced in a statement.
At present passengers have to shut down smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors are closed.
You can only start them again when the plane reaches a height of three kilometers and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers have to turn them off and do not have to start them again before the plane lands.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances may allow passengers to use the devices also at start, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most of the new transport planes and other flights that have been converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should comply with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the professional flight companion's union, welcomed the changes.
“If the new scheme is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – will benefit both sides,” commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like guardians in this topic.
However, Internet connections remained prohibited to browse, exchange e-mails, text messages or download data less than three kilometers, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actress Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the flight.
And heavyer devices such as laptops must also continue to be stumbled, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not comply with the FAA.
FAA may lift prohibitions for certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security experts on national transport issues on CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because it could cause potential disturbances in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb shipping masts”, says Rosenker.
A consultative committee of the industry, called up by the FAA to examine this topic, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to relieve restrictions on use.
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become present.
In some studies, it is mentioned that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by flight travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices by passengers, which were the latest technological trend.
New planes are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they don't care about electronic interferences.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for a few years when the flight height has been reached.
The flights adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also insensitive to interferences.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give minimal radiation when bleeding.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amason.com is one of the suppliers of a locking of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, companies invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disturbance through the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots who speak for the disturbance of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the devices by passengers when landing instruments under bad perspective conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be fully equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by the North Sea drilling island of rescued bird
A bird flying at the coasts that was found exhausted on a North Sea drill island was released again into the nature.
The water rays were fled to Aberdeen with a helicopter last month, where it was pocked up by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in the centre of salvation in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water ray was probably a winter train bird from Northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds across the North Sea.”
It seems that the tired bird was seeking refuge on the drill island.
He added: “He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help. ”
At their release, the water rays were fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's Elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide for prosperity and work in Great Britain want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have instructed the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed over 1,000 economic leaders, representing approximately British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found out that the majority of companies are currently exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU's states stagnate.
They wish that new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil should be favoured by government instead of stopping with the long and struggling process to reform the obscured EU institutions.
Asking about certain legally regulated topics – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recovered to Westminster.
It was generally dissatisfied with the internal market, as, according to the statements of companies, the costs of Brussels regulations would be greater than the advantages of being part of Europe's trading zone – even 40 percent of the largest companies agreed to the most traditional Europe-friendly.
Finally, and most likely says this, our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Great Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing to a “intelligent change” that brings the penalty of action back to Great Britain.
It is a great deal – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Great Britain would lead to a 16 percent change in opinion in favour of the remaining in the EU in a national vote.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for the EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a reconciliation of a significant shift in power relations back to Great Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and is increasingly necessary after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and financial union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom, as the result of our survey shows what a strengthened focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations for companies.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gasary
The start of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Board.
“Today’s event is a milestone: the construction work at the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has started," said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in an explanation on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its pension in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, increases the risk of conventional routes, as is heard from official side.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are 'forever' disabled.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to favour prices when the entire project is running in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way beyond the real estate site in Germany.
The economic framework data are valid, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange.
The German real estate markets benefit from economic strength and good economic conditions in the country in the European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange.
According to the search for German commercial property, the view of the transaction volume shows, says Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Investments offer an attractive interest," said Ulbrich.

Consultation before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff in charge of accusations against Jonathan Lord charged for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual offenses in relation to children before 2011, accusations against the child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised, as the Royal Commission heard for sexual abuse by children.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA stated that “in the organization never was involved in an incident of sexual abuse of children”.
Manager Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA member had been accused of infringement of child pornography, and another where one sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been sentenced to him for the abuse of trusted children.
Hare said to Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assisting lawyers, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA opening declaration to the Commission was also uncommon in the assertion that ‘there were external reviews of the YMCA where the YMCA was recognised as the front front in child safety’.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-first assessment of four possible at a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management failed "from me downwards" in the setting of Lord and did not ensure that employees were clear about their obligations to report infringements of the directives on child safety.
Lord had been sentenced for sex deceased to twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years of prison.
Hare, however, rejects the fact that the YMCA had a cultural problem that the staff had prevented from reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for them as babysittors, let them sit on his head, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose manager was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was in YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very neglectable”.
The manager declared that he would not accept the statements of employees that they would not have trusted to reimburse their commanded notification.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord had affected her judgment, why they had not reported him.
Hare declared that he informed the Board of the YMCA NSW of his opinion that the lesson to draw the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord's case" was "not to report" by staff, and the Board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to press the employees to sign secretary obligations shortly after the accusations appeared was taken by the manager of the YMCA, Liam Whitley's children's services.
He said that there should be no contamination of the evidence, but that had been “overhearted” and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse, explained the Commission.
He explained that there have been "reasonable problems" in the setting up, review, processing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was defended by 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight at the fifth anniversary of his exclusion from the Office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his retirement in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing itself on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as the Messenger of the Peace Founders in the Middle East.
On the question whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted from the evening standard from London with the words: "Yes, surely, but it is unlikely that happens, so ..."
When the horse-show experts found themselves in Sharen in Cardiff to cruise the horse of the year, they realized that there was a hard competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, who is not even in the children's garden and did only a few months ago his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee was slowly hit through the three rounds and picked up the first price – and they left 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both equally large, was praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition, which is organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his plate moisture in a cheerful angle and led the two-year-old taffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which was far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift last March on his third birthday and has been practicing with Shetland-Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Coffee are a great tension.”
They had to go against the entire participant field and have gone from the place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been presenting horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was like electricized and everyone fired it and clothed it.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and even though he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
As it starts, it will not take long until he's on the "Heart of the Year" Show – and I'm sure he will cut well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they had beaten and presented in the presentation.
They take care of good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothing has contributed to this part, that really fits perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be reformed after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested release of a reporter charged for diffamation, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for release by the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Yet, Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribe money to fake reports about a state company.
Now the new expression will be subjected to a ‘wide rectification’, stated the regulatory authority.
The "regulation" was made by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several irrelevant reports on the börsennotated company Zoomlion.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unordered”, the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to "have a administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license."
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a complete rectification of the new Express and recommend that the relevant responsible for the New Express be detected and immediately check the leadership team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about claimed financial irregularities to a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on State TV and admitted that he published false reports against payment.
“In this case I harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain confidence in the public”, he explained to the public news transmitter CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory.
I realized that I did wrong.
After Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the title page and explained that it has failed to verify the reports correctly.
In recent times, several known suspects have confessed on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel with own rail between the United States and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 cm measurement tunnel as one of the most defective passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields in the ciccuit pattern, connects camp halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless insignificant storage halls that make it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before it was unrecognized to be transported into it, the authorities stated.
At the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to the authorities' statement, were accused of the possession and the intended sale of marihuana and cocaine.
They are threatening prison sentences between ten years and life for a debt.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers set on an extensive underground network of decomposition channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cards to the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metres long pass with railways, leaving from a kitchen in a home in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love
Schauspieler Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken for separation from his wife, Topmodel Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was to be issued on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "this life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and he still loved themselves, the 36-year-old emphasized.
"We will support and love each other as the parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 their boy Flynn was born.
Veganism is, according to Lexika, distinct from vegetarianism in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the eating of sahne places, ice or a powerful Edamer, these slams are not on the food card of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the veganer leaves from all food of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but when you consider it, the veganeous nutrition world is characterized by a considerable emergence.
"Bread-ups are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the herey reform house, which provides a variety of special products for veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the boasting New Zealand countries have lived vegan, in Lampertheim he (fastly) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I killed my diet and became vegetarian."
By the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the artificial leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that there are other daily concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is a ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maxim of the veganers, extending to the whole consumption behaviour.
Instead of restraining citizens, robbers or rubbers, the veganer quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan represents its no defence, no axes, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with the nutrition conversion reduces the selection of food options, Proctor is rather a result of the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also allowed some of the attempts that were so well meant to fail.
"The drug factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to when smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And say, "Definite flavors are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the species or the type of preparation that forms the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," the Veganer explains.
For example, Proctor brings Auberginen, Champignons and a few vegan brushs to a barbecue festival.
He looks after a balanced, varied diet, where it is supposed to taste well.
Of course, you want something between the teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
He has not suffered health damage until eating disturbances, another widespread assumption.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin.
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are best, I'm going to be checked," says Proctor.
In particular, many vegan simus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are feeded with feed instead of grassing on the grass, it is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the cooling bed, the vitamin B12 share is high," says Proctor.
For Veganers, there is also the possibility to take the coensym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are okay," he explains.
Proctor must not go far ways for food procurement.
There are eventually basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need here.
Just sometimes I'll buy something special.
"Many people ignore that just the finished products are expensive, but this is what it is known for "usual" finished products."
In any case, the preparation of vegan courts was much more favourable and less timely than commonly accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few little knifes you can achieve good if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more back powder and carbon acid instead of eggs, with its vegan cheese cakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his mother-in-laws.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new job value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, skepticism was already confronted with him.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act as veganers with finger tip feeling.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to tempt enclavanasein.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as far away as suspected - and the veganer is not as restricted in everyday life as commonly accepted.
Almost food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many danish shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he turns out on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of the habit.
The restaurants work so slowly on it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people to make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, for example, the combust in manheim or the café bird free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a veganeous court on the food card.
In fact, vegan courts are there for all.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Flesh courts are, however, exclusive, in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of the past impossible," says Proctor.
But the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult at first.
Especially if you learn to understand which can also contain animal additives as a colouring agent in earthnuts, it seems that the follow-up of ethics in so many obstacles and traps quickly leaves the courage.
Not only therefore, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are added to food but also cleaning.
"After and afterwards you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to stumble," knows Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes on consciousness.
He may not make it all possible to put down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to inquire his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps his customers in breath.
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only Tuesday, the indexes of Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively defective purchases to the options markets due to technical problems.
Then the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and strike the orders.
Two days later, half of the total share trading in the United States came for several hours because of a computer pane at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange.
In addition, in the last year, the stock exchange of Facebook had been provided for supervision.
The Nasdaq systems had not grew the flood of purchase and sales contracts, later detected the stock exchange supervision SEC and distorted the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-olds around
According to the police, there was an accident when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, at 22 a.m., was on a lady’s bike on the left road from the train station to the market site.
As a 63 - year - old man suddenly walked from a local on the road, the bicycler, according to police, could no longer brake in time.
During the following collision, the footer was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and increased a 15 cm long place wound on the head.
A rescue wagon team brought the injured to the physician treatment to the klinic.
The British police sends Assange a delivery notice
The British Police has today delivered a notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who seeks refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and seeks asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had a “recognition to stand” that invited him to appear in a police guard, and added, he should not comply with that, threatening arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the accusation in a sexual offense, after its possibilities have been exhausted by British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected his objection to the delivery at the beginning of the month.
As he fears that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, on 19 June, he was seeking refuge in the Ecuadorian Message in London and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had “a 40-year-old man invited to come to a police guard at a time we chose,” said one speaker.
He continues to infringe the conditions of his release of money.
The message did not comment on the issue of the police call.
Assange fears he was delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spyment charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeaks discovery website.
A driver who had been stuck with 210 km/h and a hot drink between the legs receives 1,000 £ punishment
A car driver was imposed a punishment of 1,000 £ because he was driven with up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In front of the Colchester Office, Howie confessed without taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced for the payment of costs of £90 as well as a offering of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chemical Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a 7% stamp tax in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost more than two million pounds, and annual fees for buyers holding apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already now, the revenues from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, are higher than the sales for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, the northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-prise housing and the introduction of the related legislation against handling, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated Community tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more restraint with regard to the purchase of real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class property – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest belt, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has been experiencing about 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed an equal annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by a rising domestic market on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced a rising trend, so an investigation of Savills.
Scientists were able to lay more light on the context of a dog’s navel with his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more weaved to the right (from the dog’s view), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “In people, it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimulili, which causes positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in humans, the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and reversed, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs respond to their species’s sidely necklaces, researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the cock moves into the one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturally sound version or a silhouette to eliminate diminishing other aspects, and thereby we could control the movement of the cock more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how a otherwise expressionless dog moved the cock to the right (from the perspective of the wrecking dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, if the neck turning was mainly to the left (always from the perspective of the dog who waves), their heart rate increased and they looked distressed.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: “If you have different contests with other dogs and wedding with the neck is rather linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to improve understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, a expert on dog behaviour and hospitality at the University of Bristol Faculty of Animal Medicine, explained that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria, Canada, the following stated: “Hunds go to a robot dog, when its ‘schanz’ wedges left and not to the right, instead of being distressed – exactly different than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that in the various studies the dogs did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for various purposes, but many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are not an exception there," says Bradshaw.
But as their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves into one, sometimes into the other direction.

Pope Franziskus appointed first Cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Franziskus was first called for new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so that Franziskus will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer participate in the Pope election – that is a group of 120 "optional cardinals".
In an explanation in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals will be held before the ceremony was held for the appointment of the new cardinals known as the consistory.
“Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to call the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned”, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals would probably have decreased until February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed to allow the number of elected cardinals to be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year is therefore important because it was the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overhang on the sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the order to find opportunities to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
"Now French has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He stated that it was "good possible" that French ask the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Franziskus is “full of surprises – so we don't know who he appoints”.
GM calls new pick-up trucks back in the United States to repair the seat leans
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat leather, so a communication from the U.S. regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the cars there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seats.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines for Vehicle Safety in Head Supports.
“If the vehicle is lifted from the back, it is possible that the head support does not protect the inmates properly, so that there is an increased risk of injury”, was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models returned were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM-Trucks began in June and represents the main model start of the leading US-American car manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdowns, which had a negative impact on the sale of cars in October.
The sales of silverado and Sierra trucks, which were re-developed for the model year 2014, increased by 20 per cent during the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup Trucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 per cent at the New York Stock Exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday morning.
Depression crying of a Obama chooser
I chose President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible.
He says that Obama has made praiseworthy efforts that have been defeated by the blockadectics of the Republicans.
The blocking policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare, the drones attacks
Obama's memories on the 2008 election campaign would be a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terrible sad book.
It is a book of which I believed it would exalt me during the disgusting second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It says "The Audacity to Win" (mood to win) and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the Presidential election in 2008.
When I finish my patient writings at night and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take breath.
The choice was held into a grazing victory and news speaker held in order to reflect the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama was switched to the office at the time of 2008, he had 82% consent values.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back to present is a bad awake, as if you were ripped out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a fuzzy memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years, since I gave my vote for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could've imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced absence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that participatory blockadectics have cracked too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name only a few.
However, after countlessly defending the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I came to the end with my explanations.
I have reached a point of political depression.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to interrupt foreign heads or to kill innocent children by drones in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished to reveal government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. national, was murdered without procedural procedures, and why the public funding and expenditure borders will be overcome during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, which states that the White House's efforts to rest the media are the 'aggressivest ... since the Nixon Government'.
And in recent times it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could be contrary to its preliminary political campaigns.
It is evident that the Member's name is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacher represent the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidateship.
In the midst of Romney, he represented a confusing and unspoiled alternative, he seemed not to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, free of pressure from future elections, would satisfy the hope we had heard of for so long.
However, the return to 2008 by this book has become so stricter with the reduction of Obama's consent values to less than 45% this week.
It gives me a longing for the many promises that have resolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to place a severe loss against Clinton in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they had to return to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
"I want us to find our magic," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree stronger to you.
The views expressed in this comment are only the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters became pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a judicial dispute about the payment of $6 million to CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mine taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit from the laws personally.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives or not,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission of Palmer officially declared, with 53 votes in advance, after the recounting, the winner of the Sunshine Coast Seat of Fairfax.
Palmer demanded a revision of the process for voice counting so that it could go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system that enters data into a computer immediately and then gets the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of lead pins in the marking of the voting stamps.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
Today, it is incredible to vote with pencils.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously”.
In a public office, it is about the service to the public.
“We are seeking no reward except history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their devised department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation of the suspected manipulations of the monetary market is taking up rapidly.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the detections in the world's largest financial market on which 5,3 billion US dollars daily change the owner.
The two merchants were the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation, which the scandal draws to the Libor Interbanken business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed that it received information requests from authorities this month.
“Our investigations on this topic continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month the situation related persons stated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a former dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and is now supposed to have been admitted from his current position as the European Head of Forex Spot Trade at JPM Organ.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was advocated this week and Matt Gardiner, former leader of currency dealers at Barclay and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
The instant message group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation nearby people.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority had explained Finma that she investigated a suspected manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently in charge of claims that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPM Organ and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks come through instant messages and emails from several years looking for cases of misbehavior.
The news about these investigations has set the dealers in an area of upheaval that in recent years has heard of one of the most profitable trade units of investment banks, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currency limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-quality liquid exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume in exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “a very low-billet price influence on the market”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week she announced a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds Office after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is impeded,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building town on the Bechtle ground piece
A group of the "Schweizer Wiese" civil initiative has delighted the building tone on the Bechtle foundation at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and distributed the footway, it says in a press release.
The planned coverage of the collapseing house in the rear part of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the area threatens to rinse.
Alfred Abel, who was currently managing the property, had agreed the reconciliation action with his colleague Reinhard Domke about the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a translucency with the message "We have been able to do this" had been established.
However, this did not disturb about 20 members of the citizens' initiative in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was called "We are against building ruins".
In this way, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss grass - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passengers in front of the "building" it was clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city's project will improve many, although few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city continues to delay these answers, it says from the sides of the BI.
As it was heard, the public opinion of the Mayor also has an effect.
In May, at the municipality meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex in the Swiss way.
Some seem to be just scared, others feel as "plumps of extortion" to the population, says the press release of the BI continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick skeleton for Schiris: Mane no sulphur king
Ralf Rangnick is so satisfied with the current high-form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so the sports director of the "Bullen" was disappointed by the arbitrators.
"There is a dangerous tendency at present that Mane and Alan are pushed into the group of sulphur kings," he protected the two offensivewirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest occasion for ranknicks criticism was yellow for mane at 3:0 against Grödig on last Sunday, where the Senegalian was a supposed actress to cease - which was freely none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A crase of misunderstanding," said Rangnick, the arbitrator Harkam called "fullly overrequired".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German countryman decided: "I would have acted in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scarmskytter with Hüter.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the success, however, ranknick agreed to a lobeshymne.
"For that there are only two words: really good," he found.
There's not much to suspend.
Above all, the way the crew plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on that way.
There will be hardly any frame changes in winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Apart from a player, he wants to leave the association," acknowledged Ranknick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Law
It is a great victory for the Government of Obama: The US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US-American citizens to complete a health insurance or to pay a punishment – is constitutional in the context of the State’s tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also expressed the view that the regulation of the Health Law, which states should either extend the conditions for access to medicine or otherwise eliminate all state medical aids, would not be constitutionally restrictive.
The complaint against the law had been enforced by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-elected campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself with giant mirrors light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunrise, the Rjukan located in the Westfjord Valley usually descends from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height, a century dream came true on Wednesday.
"Definitely!", sweared Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony at TV2.
Some valley inhabitants reversed solar chairs, others set up security sunglasses.
So far, sunsick people had to drive with a seilway to a close summit in the winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to guide the rays with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in the place since 1913.
After a multiannual debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns (around EUR 615 000) expensive project.
A similar design has been provided for a few years with the Italian Alps town Viganella winter sunlight.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday learning are still on different carriage boxes of the capital and the parts of the city, but read the small printed on the yellow containers of the Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying of sunshine and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the postal building in the Ernst Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jacob-Müller Street 1 are cleared in cabin field.
Whether it is still cleared on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten, the answer to the question of FDP is not answered.
The social and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to climb here.
The Sunday learning is an important post service at the appointment post.
"This dims this business, despite the rise in prices for letters on January 2013, radical and insultable."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals of the Group and the City Association, supports his colleagues: "What I am anxious is the fact that here secretly the time of clearing is changed or deleted."
From close to citizens, the post is miles away.
"At least the letter boxes in the town parts must be cleared new slots and Rosengarten on Sundays," says Bittner and tubenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the city of Core, especially non-mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday learning.
Röhrenbeck in the city parliament asked whether the city administration plans discussions with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
But his knowledge is also a Sunday teaching in Hofheim.
Their party has stated itself for privatisations.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt's parking fees are intended to increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become sensitive.
The Magistrate of the city consults this morning about a presentation of the transport deputy Stefan Majer (Green).
Thus, parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent.
However, not the prices are to be increased, but the interval of parking hours and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
Then, in December, the City Regulatory Assembly has to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee believes that it is not a good idea.
The parking possibility directly before the business is "a unestimated advantage for smaller traders".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "relevantly and actually overdue".
Public transport is also expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions Overwhelmed hosts
With a smal frame, the Gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabic Alb.
The Elders stood on the other side with an experienced team.
Soon, however , she did not fully understand the fast actions of the pleasure cities , even as it was age-related .
With the hard and placed looks, the Gönninger did very hard.
Repeatedly, they missed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz were purely on the network center and were not in place at the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the villages of joy in all interests.
In view of this impressive and play-determining performance, the third sentence was then gained a little lazy and luxury to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to stand clearly in Nagold, will be a significantly stronger opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchele, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, in the Murgtal Hall in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and the city of joy were confronted.
They delivered a hard-fighted two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused, above all, errors and score gifts in the ball assumption; even in the passports, the precision was sometimes a lack of software and in some critical game scenes the overeifer prevented the view of possible score gains.
In this powerfully balanced meeting, however, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team was fully involved in the great physical use and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
At present, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hut in Ibach, the fifth day of care in the success of the Natura 2000 project above Hotzenwald.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of view should be cut free into the valley, said Mayor Helmut Emperor.
Many hikers, so the emperor, described this area as the shiny piece of the climb, on which the landscape offered the ideal framework for glorious views.
He thanked the participants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of human and nature.
He offered every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time, with the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration could also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government Bureau Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen rule and wanted the action to succeed.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the long-looking view covers the goal of maintaining the strongly grown old alien field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Several species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections for the conservation of species.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss a lanser for the planned biosphere area at this point.
In this plan, the current measure is not only in vacuum.
A biospheric area also offers the chance of sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the life project and the previous care days achieved for the future.
Following these various presentations, the district leader Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff informed the assistants in groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in the front, and the forestleaver may be ready to take off.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of Wacholder tubes and the care of a dry stone lock.
The objective was the free perspective at the viewpoint.
Lopenings: Buyer still a single candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarsstädchen Löffeningen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, children, youth and senior politics, as well as its own city works can be described as attractive, no second Mayor candidate has yet reported.
As the only candidate for the follow-up of the no-people mayor Norbert Brugger from age, the 46-year-old bank buyer and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löpingen has been established.
The application period will expire on Monday, November 11, at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei charged for Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, stricted on Thursday a lawine of complaints for patent injury against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he had offered insolvency increases.
Rockstar, the consortium that purchased the Nortel Patents for $2.5 billion, declared Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent injuries before the US District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the Community ownership of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused in seven cases of patent injury.
The patent deals with technology, which brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, so the complaint that thereby meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC create mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which are in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google issued a initial order of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patches.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel Patents were bought by Rockstar, Google Motorola acquired Mobility for 12.5 billion US dollars, a business that was also motivated as part of Motorola's library to patents.
“While Google failed with his attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google has injured the patent and continues to do so,” says the complaint.
Rockstar demands a high replacement of Google because it claims that Google's patent injury is deliberate, so the accusation.
Egypt defends the first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi departs the office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was defeated as the first freely elected president of the country and thus approached the succession of Husni Mubarak, who had been driven out of the office 16 months earlier.
With his official introduction before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist presidents of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth Head of State since the fall of the Monarchy some 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 in black robes dressed judges of the court, who have his seat on the Nile and have been emphasized by an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are seeking a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi at the festival ceremony, which was transmitted live in state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, a trained engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been mostly taken into vision by the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, when Mursi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 o'clock.
Only a few hundred attendants had gathered before the court to rejoice to the new president, and, in contrast to the presidial prunk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was only suddenly stopped so that the autoconvoi could cross the normally busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismic "replacement wheel" of the brotherhood, his personal prerogative has increased since his victory and a Friday talk, not only as an attendant of the Islamists, but all of them who wanted to reach the goal of the rebellion from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” explained Mursi, in a blue suit with red clothing clothing, to judges in the cabined chamber in which he put the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to hold his attendance talk.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel that played the national hymne he listened to in his position of possession.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing hall of the university with speaking hearing from "The Army and the people are a hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as Bastion of Secular Education, developed into a high-burg of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi put a symbolic oath on the Tahir place on Friday, the birthplace of the rebellion that led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubaraks, and he vowed to call back presidial powers that the Military Council had taken over from the office.
However, by delaying the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he abstains from the will of the military, indicating that the battle of power will continue.
Mursis talk on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has started.
Today Friday evening, it's called Pump this party, and on the morning Saturday night it's going on with a Ü 25 party.
Of course, fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organisers on both days.
Workers crashed from ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell down by a ladder and hurts himself.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor at the outer phase of a guesthouse.
When he climbed on the ladder to the roof, this ran away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to Salzburg's National Hospital with the Christophorus 6.
Violent in South Africa: Two-life Penalty
Nine months after the brutal rape and pollution of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the transgressor has been condemned twice for life on Friday.
This was reported by the transmitter SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had caused disturbance across the country.
In February, the 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in a industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
14 hours the doctors struggled for survival of the victim, but in vain.
The view of young people was so disgusting that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar in the evening with Booysen.
He also admitted to beat them and rape, but he argues to be responsible for the girl's death.
At first, the police had expelled from several transgressors, but two suspects released the prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecution also emphasized during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost everyday in South Africa: There are about 64,000 advertisements every year for sexual violence.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers of sexual violence at 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the black forest shinking
Jumbo looking for the "best shinking of the world": The Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited for the TV broadcast "Galileo".
The speaker is clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the shinks is the pigs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can shinks that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large schinken factory in the Black Forest, explains the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"German love shinks," as Jumbo announces to the black forest shinks.
Only with hair-protection and kittle he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at fast imbiss in forest shut
"Here I will work awesome amounts," the TV Macher, black forest shinks as a mass product.
16.000 colds per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat proportion, color: Uli explains what it comes to in quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details like the Ph value of the flesh also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm excited when you meet Roberto Blanco what's happening," said Jumbo cypriotic.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching anyway.
The viewer sees that the destruction of the keels continues to be handwork.
Because: Black forest shinking is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of shinking is the mixture of spices with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoking fire Jumbo recalls an "U-Boot".
The trick: Tand twins here in smoking provide the special taste of the black forest shink.
20 days in smoking eventually make the shink almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test nutrition.
"He's really delicious," says the facility of the TV star.
This will enable all the stakeholders to live.
You thought that travel offices belong to the past, thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record income from vacations in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now runs from a fixed annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means an increase of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As manager Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre won eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half, especially in Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are in good way towards record incomes before interests and taxes,” he explained.
This includes Australia and the UK, typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which balanced a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went well for the recreational business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while the business customers also make less expenses here.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a gain is expected for the third year in the following year for the whole year.
The shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents to $38.20 last night.
Schools are stopped to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses to English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British Romans from 1914.
In the test, "unseen texts" are also found in order to stimulate broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is disappeared.
From 2015, students have to submit an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as separate qualifications.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new educational plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first factors that have been radically transformed.
Other kernels will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for audits, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less course work.
In one talk in the summer, Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would be "coming challenging, more ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools receive an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will not be any formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, but coalition circuits say that the comprehensive mathematics test – combined with a greater weighting of the ranklist sector – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The teaching plan focuses more on ‘problems of the right life’, including financial mathematics.
Tooth Beautiful Animals and Delicious Torts
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colors present the circuit performance view this weekend in the citizen house.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
Again, the local association W514 delivers this great exhibition.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Economy Conversation Forum
The next Ecumenic Conversation Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, is the theme "Cover Hell with Hell - Theological thoughts about today's dealing with the last things".
Reference is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecoumenic Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church municipalities of Salem, the Palace of Salem and the Culture Office of the Soil Sea.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question in the Forum, how people today class the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries have known too much about it and put it on those pictures of heaven and hell, "which make our ideas to this day," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completement is rather embarrassed or even speechless.
"The greater hope has been driven out by Christian women by religious critics," says the referendum.
She has "supplied us with so many questionnaires that the proclamation marks seemed to be available to us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death."
This is related to the question of that desire, "who dreams that everything may be good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
In 1997 she promoted Dr. Theol, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenic Theology followed the University of Wilhelm in the West of 2003.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleinen Heuberg confirm their confession of faith in the company
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old young people have been confirmed by the seal care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg.
In the morning the service accompanied the group Laudate-Si, on the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit.
With the receipt of the company, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Spirit.
The companies had prepared themselves in the past months, under the direction of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous members of the community for the great festival.
In various projects, they were acquainted with various tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmenseee: Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In a lovely weather, 214 bicyclers came to Illmenseee to handle the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This informs Ulrich Knobel of the organising sports association Illmenseee.
Among the participants, especially in the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters, there were numerous cyclists who wanted to exercise their hobby in the race atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German Masterships.
Both of them were expected to resign from the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small precipitation to the goal and defended his title as a total winner of short distance.
On the second place, Pascal was able to relocate Treubel.
Theresa Duelli was at the team of the nightmare who made it at the top of the victory trap.
Anne Adel came to place two and three from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A joyful development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality.
Not only with regard to performance, the entire bandwidth of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years to over 70 years in the youngest with the oldest launchers.
In the main race this year, more absolute topathlets were at the start.
Four drivers were able to resign from the regional drivers.
Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professor from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl was two times world champion in the 12-hour walk with a team colleague.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 hectares, there was a vimper finish in the target in front of the three-sea hole.
Pangerl first rushed over the target line.
Only a second behind the routine ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place secured the area Blersch from bintwangs from Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the western African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George's wave watched his sick father lose his consciousness again and again and again and again, traveling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation that expanded to his brain and caused there a hematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neuro surgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in over-filled clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first, and isn't the first.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one physician for each 5,000 people, says the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered, in Bwelle, the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a publicly useful organization called ASCOVIME, traveling in rural areas on weekends and offering free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and riding with the worn medical equipment on the roof over unfitted terrain to the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and muds.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages free medical supply is really a reason for celebrating and wave – with its wide smiles and its unlimited energy – is happy to attend the celebration.
The next morning the team will begin with the study of hundreds of patients.
"We are dealing with 500 people per ride," says Bwelle.
They come from a circuit of 60 kilometers around the village – and it is walking.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crawls, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local dilution.
The operations usually take place in a school, the house or a apartment; after the intervention the patients rise up and go into the restoration area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the group's generator and thus works Bwelle and its volunteers until early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will then go back to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with her work it makes a huge difference for the people she helps.
A man explained that the free surgery of a loss of performance that he received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his publicly useful activity, such as Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying and voluntarily working in Bwelle's group at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
He's always in the hospital or is trying to spend money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nurse students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to collect practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help to dip blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring with you healthcare materials.
But if they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people know no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is no burden.
Making others a more happy life and thus fulfilling a promise that he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellently Massed the Fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson is an old hase in his metre, the acting art.
The old man Santiago doesn't have anything to do with fishing.
That's how the two are complementing greatly.
They almost mean to see the folds in the neck of the old man, whom the fisher boy Manolo is talking about.
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair, it's real with Janson.
Besides, the role of the old fisherman is greatly mastered by and through a character role.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will strength.
Janson is in far distances as an entrepreneur on the stage.
He makes it possible to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is made of blue-lighted bottles of water.
Regisseur Jens Hasselmann lets the old man operate in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sing with her songs and her glorious voice the life feeling of Cuba.
The four musicians play Kuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Decline to the Romans
A wastewater channel from the Roman time is obtained below Cologne, about 120 meters long.
Whoever visits Köln does not come by the Dom.
Around 157 meters, the two towers rise to heaven and make it the second highest church building of Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrant church towers, know that there is a lot to discover under the dom too.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Cologne Underworld.
Meeting point for its leadership is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Dom.
The round starts unspectacularly: "We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a auto-recorded city, so the rest of the old city walls remained just that which was not too large.
Thus, most users of the parking house now also travel to the Roman remnants and just stop their car.
But who looks more accurately, discovers in the Park Deck D2 an archaeological foundation separated by metal grids.
There are approximately five meters high ruins of handcuffs of large stones.
"There are remnants of the Roman city wall, which was built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, school leaves the participants on the upper parking level to look into a dark, 15 meters deep box.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
The next station of the round is the pretorial, and here the participants rise down into the depth.
We experience here the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the President of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "Stadt of Roman Law and city of the Agrippins, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor culture".
And the pretorial is the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the front of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel, which has been obtained here at about 120 meters long.
"You can slowly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," the school embraces the guests.
A surprise still has schools.
After picking up the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, passing box.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
Until today, at the bottom of the Michwe, whose origins decline to the eighth century, are different water levels available through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone at the courtyard, for which the construction work will soon begin.
But until completion, a few years will pass.
Bone almost cracked: Recharge of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rerolled after over four years.
A process for attempted murder, dangerous body injury and injury against two 30-year-olds has started before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The defendants are silent at the incidence.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecution proposes them to have, together with unknown competitors in Finowfurt, put on three men in a car in June 2009.
All the victims were severely injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have been part of the competing group of Hells Angels.
One was supposed to have been a high-level member of Berlin.
Preliminaryly, there seems to have been a number of cars hunting.
According to the accusation, it was about counterfeit fights and a power demonstration.
The two accused persons had been released in a first procedure at the beginning of 2012.
A judicial speaker said then that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody fever.
The transgressors had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof revoked the judgment following a review of the prosecution and referred it back to the ruling court to the country court.
One of the accuseds is currently in open execution because of another delicate.
The reconstruction of the processes in the evening was mainly at the moment.
As a witness, the investigating Commissioner was charged.
In the center of the police, there were telephone talks of the accused and other persons who had been listening to the police.
Difficult is that Rocker is almost always keeping a law for her and not proclaiming.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had packed out.
Advocate Stefan Golfier of the State Advocate Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces had appeared since the last procedure.
There are 11 further negotiations for the process.
The disposal company doesn't think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it went home.
Only: In the books of people on the trailer and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Sure, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What is closer than riding to the next drive-in to get a little?
I admit, I'm glad to join you when it's going to fast-food hole at late night or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a citizen - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
However, on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangers are noticeable.
Because what must be missing that you throw your fast-food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on weekends, paper bags are disposed of on road edges and on parking spaces.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home and to the next trash?
It's not just the case that the paper tools disperse the landscape.
Traffic facilities such as guided boards have also been covered and thereby caused accidents.
However, "removement society" does not think about such things, she probably doesn't even know what this word really means.
When you are more frequently traveling in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a back bank can look for feasted nights: clothes, bottles, and other waste are worried there.
There would be a few bites more or less, but nothing - in contrast to the road, where no one wants to walk around on the food remains of others.
I've seen the day when the cities and municipalities have to make the removal too foolish - and the fast food chains for their bites must demand pfand.
Obama's retreator in health policy
After heavily criticism, President Obama made a retreator yesterday at his frequent, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of insurers received a letter of announcement from their insurer, the Republicans sent to the President in the last few days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
“The majority of the citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them,” he said at a talk in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the announcements, Obama asked those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could receive better and more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than forecasts.
"They're coming a better offer," he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the people who have concluded insurance themselves have to look after another tariff, since their contract does not comply with the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say to these Americans that they have earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the start of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as all others," she said.
I'm determined to recover your trust.
This statement of a challenging Sebelius on a consultant sitting behind her at the yesterday hearing at the Representative House was taken up after a discussion with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly urged the question why the "architectin" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse a state-promoted insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news transmitter CNN that Israeli fighting aircraft had attacked an air weapons base in Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
The aim was "rakets and related equipment" of which the Israeli government feared they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab transmitter Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base point in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday in the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis was responsible.
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base point in Latakia, on which Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 km and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilos.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes that Israel had carried out the attack, but was not safe.
In any case, a speaker of the Israeli Defence Ministry said, "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver soil air rockets to Hisbollah earlier, partly successful.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every attempt by Syria to provide hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means the crossing of a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented consent that the U.S. spionage “has gone too far without measurement”
With an unexpected consent, John Kerry pointed out that the United States' defence of its monitoring programmes had become too far in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he was liable together with Barack Obama to turn to "autopilot" when the explosive disclosures of Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spying activities of the NSA.
Through the through-sicked information, the U.S. Government has been admitted to a diplomatic storm of disarmament from the sides of its allies.
Kerry said in a speech transmitted by video connection at the Open Government Conference in London: “The President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned about some things that have been quasi per autopilot simply because the ability was to do what was still on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on 11 September.”
As a first high-level member of the U.S. Government, he then admitted that the US spionage has exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights have been abused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of goodness and had been saved many lives by its surveillance operations.
He added: “We have to deal with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is conscious of killing people, bombing into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In the meantime, US legislators will travel to Europe in order to disperse the concerns against the claimed American spionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the USA in the anti-terror efforts, as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with our joint efforts to combat terrorism," Murphy, who is the first democracy in the Senate and acts as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to clarify there that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their trouble with the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have stressed relations with some US alliances, although the head of the Secret Service explained this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO alliances and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from documents distributed by Snowden, according to which the NSA monitored the phone of the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The Head of National Secret Services, James Claper, defended the spying in allies as necessary and explained that this is common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the trip of the convention to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "severest words".
He said that European governments must be honest to their people about the kind of spying programmes they have used for years.
"We can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect Europeans' rights, but they must also deal with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," says Murphy.
During the weekend, John Kerry has a trip to the Middle East and to Poland to deal with the cruelness of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A violent injury at the spring gelenk threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Federalliga outdoor game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz wants to use Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he'll try to train with the crew.
So far he could only do that individually.
"We will decide on his operation on the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his six hits with the best guns.
For the Mainzers have already to abstain from the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman complains against prison penalty in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has made an appeal against the judgment and has been released on a deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a province court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after she had indicated to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours on Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held them.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she was safely reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to have discovered the story.
Until the trial, she was in police warranty on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a prison with a low level of security at the edge of Phukets instead of in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy Liga, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s welfare and wanted her back to Australia.
"Of course, we are worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on the free foot.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is making holidays in Krabi, South Thailand.
From the court's side it was heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, could be tried to improve its depressed tourist image, and it is therefore a free saying.
