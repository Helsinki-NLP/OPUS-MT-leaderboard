Triumph of the right-populists in Austria, a total of 29 percent
A sensible weakening of both parties of the large coalition so far and a significant strengthening of the right-populist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria after the first provisional results.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (OVP) suffered losses, where the position of the former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the hill.
In contrast, the Chairman of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntnt Landführer Jörg Haider, rests for a triumphant return to the Federal Policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country by 29.8 percent of the votes, but from the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the OVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party, which demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
At the beginning of July, when the OVP was excluded from the coalition, the people's party had a clear precipitation before the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for having the government failed.
In the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible withdrawal from the party chairman and previous vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such a development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the election debt, i.e. to renew the large coalition from SPÖ and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-popular parties - the Freedomal (FPÖ), the BZÖ received provisionally 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes -, the social democrats at the same time expressed their fear that 1999 could repeat when the People's Party with the Popistic Agreements (this time the FPÖ was still unanimous, it split off from the BZØ in 2005) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
It is obvious that Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with each party, is going from a return to Vienna to the Austrian Federal Policy.
In addition, the Group of the Greens, which suffered slightly losses and broke from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties, entered the House.
No other party probably has misled the four-percentury and, therefore, did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India for the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg considers that a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations could come.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then surely it comes to a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a penalty sentence, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
"His problem could be cleared," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of freedom penalty, Mukherdshi's view would be the best if he would go in appeal at a higher instance.
He could thus request release for deposit and in freedom wait for his judgment, says the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal at a higher court, and then would be in question for him," said the Chief of the Czech Diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the condemned "competent legal support" to the condemned, the Indian Minister pointed out.
At the same time, he said that such help was already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech press agency ČTK confirmed the problem of Czech entomologists before his partner.
"We really believe it is a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he had received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister rejected.
"Mir was already promised quite much," he just found.
A Czech is directed over ringing around the sea ground
It enters an electronic map on which Australia and the neighbouring sea areas are pictured.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the neighbouring sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself", says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-headed teams of UN Divison for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the Director of Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it on and on.
Here is work and enthusiasm.
So far, the sea ground has a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here is oil to be found, the wider herb and other non-resistant raw materials, but so far unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to developing a medicine against cancer.
A sea ground, larger than the mainland
Today, the lands of railways reported their right to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental sea, which often reaches up to some hundred miles from the shore of a country to the sea.
This country, according to the Convention, has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly expressed as a continental shelf is regarded as the part of the sea floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the ocean, often also the border of two hundred miles of the sole economic zone,” says Mikulka.
The application submitted by the corresponding country of the Commission to fix the external borders of the continental shelf must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical assistance.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three last-named countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently encountered Australia’s success, which as the first country could significantly increase its sea areas.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea soil that was approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
As they promise, they will have an invaluable value in the future of the use of the sea floor.
Further countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment in which you ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean soil, which is referred to as the Convention as "the common heritage of mankind".
There's no state in a special position here.
The right to promote in this area gives an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor is not a gold graver country," says with a little overdrive director Mikulka and adds, "whichse areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Block under the Joint Organisation Interoceanmetal.
This was given in 1991 by the Convention, as well as by the investors of some less than another countries, the status of a so-called "trail-breaking investor".
The organisation has the right to promote the area ClarionClipperton in the Still Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea ground.
"There can be a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich founding place of polymetallic circuits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a convergence as a pattern.
It reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, of the sensible shame that brought the legend to life after the Golem.
German specialist forces were on site at hostage exemption
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
About the circumstances of liberation eleven kidnapped European tourists in Egypt, more and more details become known.
Indirectly, according to the Defence and Interior Ministry, German specialist forces were also involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both the Federal Army and the GSG 9 officials were the Federal Police Flyer Staffel, the Federal Criminal Lamb, and logistics experts in the technical aid work at the place of liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the Ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Happyly it hasn't come," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry of Inners.
An attacker had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and her eight Egyptian companions on September 19, in the south of Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and the Chad had been slaughtered.
The identity of the hostage holders remained unclear until the last time, as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued people have now arrived well in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages are in the guard of the German message.
He did not comment on details of release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "picture" stage, the five holidays and the special forces are to be fleeted out with an airbus of air weapons and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House rejects rescue package
The first Chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollars heavy rescue package for the financial markets hardly fail.
The Dow Jones came out in the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the financial market rescue package of the government.
Despite all the appeals by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to reduce the chaos to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollars heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the Members to approve, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the prevention of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones broke up by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were worried about the fact that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after notice of the failure, to fall back.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, it is necessary to approve both the House of Members and the Senate.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organisers:
For travel bookings for the next few months, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even with more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic perspectives, the lust of the Germans remains untrusted according to a study.
In the winter season bookings, the rice offices recorded a surplus of 31 per cent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings already increased for the autumn months is also available.
Thus, the turnover of the travel agencies for October was about 11 per cent compared to 2007, the DRV informed.
The basis for these results are the figures of GfK which evaluate monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and calculated high for the overall market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travels were asked in particular to the United States, the DRV informed.
Here the booking growth is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, and the homefilds of the Germans are specially requested destinations.
In particular, holidays are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for customers than for individually organised holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months had also been very well booked, so that the previous year would be a turnover increase - although, according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-hits in the endless loop, beer from litres and promise in designer-dirndln.
It's a shower debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV modern and wears a customized Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Just three minutes on the show, the photographers fall on us and cut the memory cards full - very flattering and that at my first show visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap Dirndl seems to meet its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the white-wheel-creator, the well-being remained in the carriage until the date.
But first came to the Theresiense, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather hoss; no one looks reversed or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Strange views at the chocobanan stand only harvest my dirndls.
A monksman makes me aware that I had misbound the scrap: "Lefts up free, middle virgin, right forgive, left widowed behind."
In my home, I'm putting the sleeve back to the left.
"Pass," it said and laughs.
Others make less efforts for subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filthy housings on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and stretches the naked back part to an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long-drawn "ooooo".
That's what he tells me after he's done his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, all of which thinks he's a trash.
So Bob is one of these famous "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have the luck of losing the alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, healthcare professionals are running over the festival site that must take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the wheel - always four at a time dragging a covered cargo of tent to tent.
It works like with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
Whoever is in the promille bag under the plane, you can't see.
"These are those who goartakers pack," one of the sanitaries called to me on request and disappeared in the garbage.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female walker who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on the Friday afternoon at the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was brought to Queen's hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspicion of a lightweight ride.
In the meantime, he was released on a deposit.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, European powers were interested in entering deep into the rear of Turkey.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, emperoral struggle.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guides tell you.
The building is riding at the end of the railroad with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German Councilhouse.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is crushed about
But once you are within the waved driver, there is no doubt about the excellence of the project whose western access was this.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was a late in the imperialist game, had to do so before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and further according to what is Saudi Arabia today.
However, Germany's imperialist project was encouraging during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and its Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the inconvenient borders of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces kicked out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha railway station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen, largely overflowed from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gate to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ACP has introduced a gentle new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of neighbouring regions, produced by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a approach policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian divisions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the core data of this new foreign policy, I have gone to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on slices that produced the equation of the old world in the famous documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is viewed as a new city, for the new worldly government project, to turn back to the osmanic past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of distrust in the west, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the ACP's main business office, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a growing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and bowls in which middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first businesses of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party of Europe.
I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the Party's external policy is now to reinforce Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from her backland.
Today it has to look at the East and the West at the same time.
There wasn't either one or another.
She had to do both.
"But surely Turkey could eventually," I asked, "twould be to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "I didn't want to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: the relations of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally beneficial for Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel to eastern eastern railways towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha railway station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments, Mr Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the same time, there seemed to be no doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Dood" was handley (after call on 11 September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonics and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth chore, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any music that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that has never been read for years.
How often the death held us to "leave the music to speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sing!"
His type of conduction was absolutely clear and precise, but never prevailing.
Whatever the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any director had to be hit to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonics.
In the last 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Tod Handley was the rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated dirigents who, according to his words, went simply "with one or two famous shovels in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25th) you write that in 1946 "he took over the teaching of the economic history in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while he studied at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author note in Woodruff's book "Behind Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a teacher of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as the British rubber industry in 1958.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universitys of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
He finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois in 1953.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black-white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They gave me attention to them for their ease and for the power they radiate, as they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magic moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November Honda catches with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior room, this large-space limousine still offers a significantly larger.
This also includes the technical fees that make it possible to save even more convenient driving and gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, as aesthetically, the new Jazz has a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism should be emphasized.
Yet, before you start analyzing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where the Jazz is the most sold car of 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, 17% of the estimated growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002. This is 6.7% of the total sales in Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
Exactly considered, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models, which are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared with the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, Honda sets on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters, which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remainder is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 inches ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 inches) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 inches.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due to the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in Jazz's predecessor model.
The capacity of the bagroom, which has a system of double cargo surface, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation's baggage.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz bagroom with a 1.2-liter benzine engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enable low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions to have excellent technical performance and at the same time provide rotation-intensive performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first version of 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6000 rotations with a maximum rotation of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS in the previous generation, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene' that avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight depends on bees' swimming behaviour and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co Technical Development Centre have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layed Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the face eyes of the bee, which can see over a 300 degree angle in all directions, allowing them to fly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To imitate the round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notices obstacles that are in the distance of up to two meters before the BR23C and are located in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance up to the object and sends a signal to a shoulder-like microprocessor, which is translated directly into the signal for preventing the collision
`In the moment that obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately switch the direction by rotating his wheels around 90° or even greater angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other systems is that this exception manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can not differ up or down, but also overground; he can only move to two dimensions and to the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not into the endless directions and in an infinite way how it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan, next to acceleration and braking functions, used the rotation function to prevent the small robot from collisions.
`This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the manövers performed, so it can continue to work with just a few thousand KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it is not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of the technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years to the serial cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the target while driving and avoiding obstacles on the road.
It is shaking before it is loaded with a mortgage.
It must be realized that the Ministry of Finance of the United States, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of US citizens in hypothesis stories of the claimed payable banks, a entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfer was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', says it.
Or maybe, the 'Hotel of Bad Credits' or the Distortion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specifically his receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And above all where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a page for the teenagers than a place for all the spectators.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, with which this would be the first bank in Japan that will spend nine billion dollars and thus take 21% of its capital, a innovation that is due to a strong case of its stock exchange rate.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley strains will be purchased at a uniform price of $25.25, which is a total of $3 billion.
The estimated price is below 19% of the rate value of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares that will secure a profit of 10% and can be re-saled at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business is being carried out on the basis of a single average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current rate.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, decreased by 6.79% by $23.07 at $17.00 GMT.
`This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the status of a holding bank', explained John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand its businesses to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The methods presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last days: last Monday Morgan simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for some $8.5 billion to Japan.
A week ago, in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, director of the MUFG, we thought that the participation would consist entirely of tribal powers.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and safeguard ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for their Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their rate value.
And the business will take place with a reduction in profit by approximately 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half its preferential acts into tribal acts in one year if the latter are exchanged to more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan declared that his balance has been reduced since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their stock exchange rate went down by half, while the price of insurance against incapacity speeded up.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only survivors of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, 15 billion dollars, partially rejected at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic restarts socialism around the 21st century.
This is the common project of Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his associates and friends, was the third one who put the plan of a new constitution to the choice.
Mission fulfilled because, according to 80% of voters, the public results in the referendum agreed 64% with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% were in agreement with 'No', 7% of the list of elections were invalid and 0.7% were delivered empty.
In order to adopt the constitutional project, a vote must be achieved by more than half of all votes delivered.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the elections and a counting of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes' and prophesied 63% to 70% to him.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had also demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has victoriously triumphed', he had in Guayaquil, the seat of the government, 280 km southwest of Quito, assured and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his chilenian equalist Michelle Bachelet.
The elections held in breast-feed in accordance with the Observatory Order of the Organization of the American States (OAS) referred to a text of 444 points for the safeguarding of the 'new socialism' for which the President is in place.
The constitutional project transfers government power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to "development planning" in a country that is largely living by oil promotion by foreign companies and by the exchanges that send the immigrants to the country.
The project, which is driven forward by the 2006 selected Correa, also allows the Head of State to have a comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates every four years and will have the possibility to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education which the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants living in 50% of the population below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will bring an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial support point as the starting station for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in the Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the wilderness for 11 days, were delivered back to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military support point al-Maza right next to the international airport of Cairo at 15.30 p.m. on a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without speaking to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers were not paid ransom', explained the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the rolling field.
After being captured on September 19 at an area car safiri at the foot of the Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly approached by 35 unknown kidnappers from a hide.
It is 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organiser of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board of two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before the morning damping.
`On both sides shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remainder fled', said this responsible who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is just located, about the role, secret agents and elements of Italian specialities.
`We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units', he explained without further details.
He also argues that a ransom was paid.
On the morning the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a landing vehicle at a patrol where the kidnappers were six of them, including the Chad leaders, killed and two arrests.
The army explained that they were in connection with a rebel group from Darfour, the movement Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, contradicts this movement immediately.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the headlines and is central to the current election campaign.
Well, better.
But one area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will rise and bring up the painful sums that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that are hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important constructions?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides EUR 3.5 million alone for the restoration of the Castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage belongs to the American culture and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all governments, in mutual voting.
In Quebec, in the Association of History Societys of Quebec, at least 40,000 officials gathered in 211 historical societies, strive to deal intensively with history, to save a few larges the numerous private archives, and to obtain archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the strength of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments State parts of the Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux States of the Belgian-Long Fortis Bank, which is encountered by the U.S. financial crisis in Turbulence, want to take the arms: the three states make a total of EUR 11.2 billion available to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which is also established in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now being taken in connection with the bank could have a precedential character.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to approximately 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell some of its shares, all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep valley journey last week, in the second half of the week already recorded serious crisis scenarios.
However, analytists agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a plague.
The institution's securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year depth.
Since Jänners, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the group's market value is EUR 14 billion, but according to its management, it is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion expensive American rescue package and the insecurity caused by it on the markets is debt in the valley of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses have slightly increased.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new Director-General of the Bank.
The Money Institute was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interesting one with a fair offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor should shake for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers, the bank's branches have not been stumbled.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies their own.
Fuchs in chicken stall
Due to the drug consumption of a person, life and health insurance in America often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust in the fuchs the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of prescription data.
Insurances shall determine fees and amounts of payment in the event of injury depending on the condition of the customer, and should the risk be estimated too high, insurance will not be completed at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick invented a far more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacists, speak what preparations have been bought, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medications, it would result that his blood fat levels are untreatable, which would automatically reach it into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance only needs to make more of the paper crumbs, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the perspective of the insurers, while the above are not.
For querying and processing the data, their own companies have formed which, before referring the data, ask the patient for his consent.
Now they have to do this by law, although absences have not been done until now.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and connect them with the data on the use of medicines. They thus provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use will be more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a private privacy law for health data, its effect is only on healthcare providers and insurance providers.
The draft legislation has already been presented to the Congress, which allows the authorities to control data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can be transmitted only with the consensus of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned may hardly forbid access to his data, since insurance does not conclude any contract with him.
And so the chickens are only left somehow the grace of the fox.
Global Food Plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After both the European Union and India are the leading trade partners of each other, this was the main topic in addition to other global problems at the nineth summit.
Today the French-Indian Summit also takes place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more voices and laws in international affairs, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether they should support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the nineth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. A agreement was concluded with a double trade in the next five years, i.e. to increase to about 100 billion euros.
Given the increase in the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 civil aviation agreements with India were also legally summaryed into an agreement, so that air transport will be fleeted in the future.
By 2009 India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one India, New Delhi is only nine of the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
These were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which was strongly condemned by both sides, and the call for an UN conference was also urged.
The Doha round should also be completed and both sides are blamed for failure.
The EU underlined that it holds its energy and climate programme, i.e., which is to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed to conclude a global compromise at the future Climate Summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, so both support the opening of an international conference on financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Head of Government visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
However, in Paris it is hoped that contracts should be made to French companies in the value of EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency notifications, the Agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurter Buchmesse.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book fair expects the current event over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171.790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403.000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Culture Maria Giro will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony at the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 qm large exhibition "Punto Italy".
There will be a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives are discussed around the publishership in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but in particular in the adult and youth parliament.
A year ago, the billionaire Steve Fossett's smaller aircraft was recovered.
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which was discovered on September 3, 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was found.
The individual parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully defended the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a troop was sent out. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or near it.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Security Office (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent for a few hours after the plane's observation, which identified the machine: it is the Bellanca 8kcab that lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett in Yerington, Nevada, started a three-hour flight.
Last night, some of the personal items of Fossett were found by a couple near their house at the Mammoth Lakes in California, near the border to Nevada.
It is two exhibitions named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long series of records.
In 2002, he managed to surround the worldball in a hot air balloon in the sixth time: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he surrounded the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Among his several records, a height flight of 15445 meters also counts over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls from the traditional schemata through its original design and the special line management, the discharging surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring new breath to the sector with this victim.
Just because of its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
Thus the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new thing in the automobile sector in restraint Italy.
A project with a maximum load that will be carried out in various stages, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como, to give a special optic: the new Suv will appear as a three-dimensional model in its nearly real dimensions.
In fact, the car seems to appear from the poster on which it is pictured.
On this, using the Elumina8 technology of the new Glk will be illuminated in all its details in different moments to reconcile itself again as a whole.
It is undoubtedly the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new type of author clam in this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in traveling the interests of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" who has traveled for years afterwards by the Italian national team and who, honestly, did not cause serious problems until recently.
Never happened to conflicts with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the tricolori, which the cities of the military appear on, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a conflict with a truly right-radical fanscene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided 144 cards to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued by name and thus easily controlled.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal all: under the travel to Sofia, no one had a running stage ban.
Four fans of the Italian crew, which were already preloaded in this respect, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to begin further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
It is an international ban that prevents access to the stages throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation practices, which could follow little more than 150.
"This fire must be exposed immediately, and that such a behavior does not in any case give the opportunity to justify," says Viminal.
That's why, "Outlooking above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
For it is actually a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisor) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the aise, i.e. the secret services that are dealing with the problem of the stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (explicitly expressed in no joy), which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but no doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the number 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are sanctified in the country of their action.
So far, this group had remained in the chamber, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the hymne of Mamelis: even though this is not a crime, they allow me, but there is no education...".
