Crying to the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have started well, and crying and calling in nature is beginning to move people wide and wide around the world.
“You have the collision, I need Iceland,” says a woman in the large world in comments on an advertising from the market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland at YouTube.
Another audience will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says that it must come as first to Iceland's end as her loved one is inhabited there.
However, in the United States, she is unhappy and expects to have to wait for another month.
Another observer asks whether the route to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Thordson at the Peel advertising office, who came to make the ads together with the international advertising office M&C Saatchi, says receipts have been more hopeful.
“I came to many inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very well but this new campaign has already begun to be assessed.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, that is to get foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has been incredibly good.
In a relatively short time, we have been discussed in some seven hundred media worldwide, totally reaching over two billion people.
The value of this report is estimated at £1.8 billion.
It's not funny."
The main market is the same as the United States, and the campaign has been very well there, although the Americans are not on their way to the country.
According to Egil, marketing areas such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also taken care of them, Russia, which is a comfortable surprise.
It has resulted in reaction from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically imposed on them.
“ These ads have traveled far beyond what we expected, ” says Egill, but over four million people may have looked at YouTube’s material.
“ We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
The pictures on the opening took The Year of Seaberg, the Morning Magazine photographer, at the hands of advertisements that carry the headline “Let It Out” about the middle of the last month.
The cups went wide and wide, such as in the Way of School in Reykjavík, in the Five of Reality, in the Forest Foss, in the Sunshine, and in a cave at the head of the Shepherd.
The leaders were Samuel Bjark Peter’s son and Gina Paul’s Olaf’s son at the Scote of Production and the captured fear of the Son of God.
In their roles, Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
A number of Icelanders made the advertising, but at the same time recording took place in Southern South, another group in Western and Western Fjords was made.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is only the first phase of this work for an Icelandic office,” says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has worked very well.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the limits we are talking to."
Explosion: Talk the job market position, life-eye and many other things
Asmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children's Languages, meets in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. on the Wave today.
He is also a working market minister and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair and other matters.
He also discusses rural matters and transports to a land that has gone badly and has been disputed over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, chairman of the VR, will also meet the part, but he will discuss his criticism about investments in life-saving treasures and present ideas that work movements and professionals will withdraw from the governments of the treasury to reduce the risk of economic expenses.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar, the son of Ingimar, a traveler in the East, and John's daughter, the manager of the Nordic Marketing Office, about the position of travel services in the rural area.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading ban on what is to come.
Listen to the section below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's how she looks today 25 years later.
Elisha Donovan, a playster, had a successful career in adolescent classes.
Yet, she was worldly celebrated as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in the sections of Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
It has been little in the past, but she has been able to look over the road and express herself about Clueless in a lovely TV in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“ I must acknowledge that I built the person mostly on girls I met in school that were not good for me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after night's visit.
Today, about fifty cases arrived on the board of the police in the capital area, reporting in the police journal that the matter had been diversified.
The day at the Police Station on the Vienna Street began with the need for a police switch from a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of an alcoholic race.
Did not want the man to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of police who told him to leave.
The man won a continuing stay at the police station because of his conduct.
Then a man was arrested during the morning year suspected of infringement in a company in Kópavog.
Police also had to interfere with two men in Breithole because of announcements of body attack.
In addition, a woman sitting at the shopping center in Copavog could not pay for the account after the meal, so it was called to the police.
Also, stolen in the city was reported this morning.
Renault’s driver looked off her for a while, and she was then taken freely.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Happy Party - The Horrible Destiny of the Cleasants
The doctrine has reached a flight on the Internet that is cursed over the Joyful Group, but the playster Naya Rivera drowned in California during the days, thus became the third main player of the elements to leave life long before age.
The classes of the joy teams (e.g. Glee) are a popular series of songs, dances, and joy.
The thresholds drew about the so - called joy team of youths at school, their love, and their destiny.
It was not always lucky to be in the party of joy, but through singing and dancing, the individuals of the elements seemed to be able to overcome any situation in their lives.
But outside the scenes, there have been a lot of disasters over the actors and employees of the parts, so much that the doctrines have awakened to the fact that the elements are cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the parts, a complaint driver who did not call all his grandmother.
After the series of parts had run its stage, Rivera went to have the actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him his first and one child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband, and then understood.
However, Dorsey refused to complain, and the problem of home violence was dropped.
On July 8, last year, Rivera was reported to be missing after her four - year - old son was found alone on a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy found himself sleeping in a rescue west on the boat and could report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stuck to swimming, and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never left himself there.
He raised a huge search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we had been looking for from Rivera’s drunkenness.
Five days later, Rivera was found and made a public decision.
It is assumed to have been in the water in a large amount of stream, and its last requirement to save the son is new.
The cause of death was recorded by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the features, the American footballman with the angel voice that played the key role in bringing the Joy Team to glory and respect.
But beyond these elements, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
Since he was 13 years old, he had struggled with addiction and proved hard to escape from it.
In 2013, his colleagues felt enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and seemed to look better.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after having gone out with friends.
Banamein proved to be a deadly mix of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that willing works were being done.
Moneith had been treated, and his tolerance had decreased so much that the dose he had previously endured was deadly.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death devoted his fellow workers, but his contesting wife, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the parts, devoting them a whole part of Moneith’s memorial and his Finn’s personality.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the parts, Puck was an American footballman, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members in the Joy Team, or all until he gained the courage to acknowledge that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of child porn.
At his home search, he found an enormous amount of child pornography, and the matter was soon asked out publicly.
It was obvious that Salling had been away.
He was then accused and convicted for his wrongdoing.
He had four to seven years of prison, in addition to what he would come to have to be registered with sexual offenders and seeking the treatment of childish affection.
Before the judge had decided the punishment, Salling, who was then free from security, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not only the actors of the elements that fell from far before age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant player.
He was suddenly asleep in 2013, only 41 years of age.
At the stage, a woman named Nancy Motes also worked.
She was the younger sister of the Great Star of Julia Robert, who had no beautiful story, but she accused Robert of great government and disrespectful behaviour.
Motes died her own life in 2014, with severe depression.
She left a letter to her wife, calling her mother and sister, among other things, responsible for what happened to her.
“ My mother and my so - called sisters will not get anything but the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the elements.
She has recently been accused of using her companions of distraction and excavation at the recording site and having overwhelming constellations.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the 2012 elements.
He was arrested and accused for a driving force in 2019, which felt greatly intimidated.
The playster Heather Morris played a major role in the factors.
In 2010, she found unpopular computers in nectar pictures of them and published them on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the parts and in a love relationship outside the parts.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used her to be violent in her relationship.
Flowers can be placed on almost everything
It increases the maturity of children when they are allowed to play out with their parents to cultivate flowers and watch them grow and grease.
It can also be done forever with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Buying a boat after the tenth grade
“ I don’t think we are many sailors working in the play schools of the country, ” says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, who is fishing on the beach in summer but is psychology at the University of Iceland over winter time. ”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If fishing is good, it is possible to have good income and I find it great to let go of learning.
The takes also work well in the winter," says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, a 25 - year - old psychologist who is fishing the beach in summers like the past summers.
Axel was the newest to the bridge of the Talknaver when a journalist reached his speech late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The knowledge I was in the tenth grade, I took ship management rights for boats under 12 feet [12 m], and I bought my boat the summer after I finished my primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my friend, the son of Hartmann, and I made the boat name his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat was carrying his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half a million, at the beginning of summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had hunted.
So I had the boat indebted at the end of this first summer on him."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished the primary school?
“ I had been putting and collecting money, I had been working with Dad to the sea when I was a boy, I was all fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my square money in my boats.
Axel is born on the Isaphard, from where all his mothers are; but he has lived in Copavog since he was a boy.
“ I can hunt here in the western area because I have a law home at my grandmother’s Iceland.
I learned in this area west of the rods with my dad.
I shall move between the distances, according to the way I feel; for this field of fishing is over all the western lands.
Though I feel the best to be from the west, I have also been given around the snowfall and other things.
I have also given for the south, but the preferential trait," says Axel, who always runs one light light in the morning and sometimes says speaking to the moon and singing for the sky, in the one time together on the ball sea.
“ The network out on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to video shows, and music.
I don't feel like being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing in hazard, but certainly sometimes something has been weathering, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he's never sea-sick.
He says the length of the day of work depends on how fishing goes each time.
“ I am never more than 14 hours hunting at once in the beach, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the taxi, but then I have been continuing for one and a half a day in a bit out on the sea to fish. ”
The arrangement in coastal fishing says that he is so that he can hunt 770 kilos a day, which he feels inhibited.
“ Other restrictions are that I may not hunt Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days for weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is required to calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to its head.
Thus, the Divider may also go for me, and the sea lock that is well placed at the fishery should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the thunders of salt sea on its beach fishing, but also only floods and some other species flow with.
Axel is working over the winter period with the university study at the Nupi School in Kópavog.
“ I don’t think we are many sailors working in the country’s play schools, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was just planning to work temporaryly at the school.
“ I got stuck there because I find this awesome job.
I hope that the psychology study will take advantage of me at the stage in the future, ” says Axel, who has also studied business.
An error occurred while registering prevented backcoming.
An error in a recording magazine that is filled out when it comes to the country, resulted in that a person, a resident in the country, was not called back to showing.
It is not a condition to file the ID number if the person fills the paper in English, as it is done in English.
“ This will be examined during the week, ” says a pharmacist in the field of pharmaceutical protection.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday.
One of those who proved to be positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the application of so - called homesickness rules.
The residents in Iceland are then investigated at the land’s arrival and again preached in the showing four to five days later.
In the midnight news, however, it appeared that the person had followed the old system.
The exhibition on the borders was negative, and it was not called back in the screen for the virus.
Camilla Ruth Sigfusdaughter, a pharmacist specialist in the field of pharmaceuticals, says to a newsletter that this may be a mistake in the electronic recording magazine.
If people fill out the entry magazine in English, it is not a condition to insert an ID, as it appears in the English version.
Finally, it was primarily thought of foreign travelers.
Therefore, the patient was not automatically invited to take a show.
However, Kamilla says that even though they have filled the English recording form, many have followed the rules on home - to - home route, and in some cases, employers have also been alert to sending people back to the show after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be considered during the week how accessibility can be facilitated by people to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is isolated, and six have been infected.
They're all taking a show, but two of them have been showing symptoms.
Infectious drinking is now undergoing the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, mostly due to two infects reported on Friday.
In both cases, the Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are varieties of the crown virus that have not previously been found.
In the second case, the bond focused on Israel, although it was known that the person who moved the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
In total, there are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID. is.
135 are in disease.
Four out of five infects unconnected
Five inland infections have been identified here in the past days.
Of them, four of them are not connected and have not been found for the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Infectious drinking is still in place.
Originally, at the third decade, they were dispatched to a disease of sixteen.
Overall, there are 34 infectious diseases because of these new infections that were detected yesterday.
This is for the second time in a short time that detects athletic events, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Johnson, head of the General Police Officer, says that very slowly, as long as people follow the rules and regulations.
“ We are constantly impressing all those living here to maintain individual infectious agents.
We also need to emphasize that there are certain rules to apply.
Then there can be an event," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping individual infectious agents in the air.
In addition, the rules and criteria are in constant review.
“ What needs to be done, and what is constantly needed by the General Department of Humans and the Medical Office, is to bear in mind these individual infectious precautions.
Both at home and at the same time in service companies.
To wash hands and to use alcohol.
It prevents infection from continuing," says John.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to maintain the success we have achieved here. ”
40% of victims of COVID-19 had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone the difficultness of her father to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical advice.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was led to sudden respiratory difficulties due to chronic virus infections.
Diabetes were indicated in the death witness as a underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is feared that the same will take place.
The Reuters report says that the fear of Brumfield is not reasonless.
The numbers of new studies by the U.S. authorities show that at least 40% of those who died with diabetes 2 were underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the proportion increases to half.
The U.S. P.D. (CDC) study included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the February and May period.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious expert, says that the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed of diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuter’s slow growth was hidden, showing the answers from the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported the underlying diseases.
“ Diabetic disease was already prolonged.
Now, COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful age," Reuters of Elbert Huang, head of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes are more common among black and South American people, which have also been worse from the chronic virus.
One of the best protective measures for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control with physical training, healthy diet and healthcare professionals.
However, the chronic virus age has made many difficult for weeks to maintain a routine.
In this case, some have had a high price of insulin to continue working and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 could have caused by the virus.
When SARS transcended the chronic virus in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in the 2009 pig breeding epidemic, this group for three times greater risk of hospitalisation.
When MERS experienced this in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to disposal had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because of the effect of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could have taken away a number of previously unknown complications.
“ I fear that we will see a flooding wave of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the chronic virus age could indirectly lead to increases in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies have led to the increase in diabetes.
Reuters say that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the crown virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lung and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many who have diabetes.
In this case, the high rate of glucose and lipid in diabetic patients can produce a proper “cell messenger storm, ” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Injured intravenous cells may also lead to inflammation, which can again cause fatal blood clots.
“ This is all one big pussy, ” says Dela Cruz.
"It's related to all of this."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited to champagne, and they went out of the room."
Azrun Magnus daughter and Atli Bollason, a couple of them, received the extraordinary request from the artist Ragnar, the son of Israel, to have sex before a camera for work that the artist was set up in Paris.
“We loved each other, so this wasn’t complicated. ”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and his grandmother, Azrain Magnus ’ daughter.
“ I was very pleased with her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but then it also felt quite unhearted.
And I'm still sorry," he says.
Assron remembers this too, the husband recalls the first regularly found.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Last only for the weekend," she says, "which also attracted the husband at the first visit.
“ I found and feel so excited around Atla that I loved.
There's a lot going on and a lot of things happening, and I was thrilled by it."
Atli says that the couple stressed their own ways in their relationship.
“ We don’t bind our baggage to the same knees as travelers.
We're avoiding the routines we're distinguishing around us."
It is possible that they took the work from the artist Ragnar’s son, although it would be softly said unusual.
“Christine Anna, our common friend, contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörn Ragnar’s wife, on Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, met the threefold on Snaps, and got a desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through their plans for a video show, which he was going to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the autumn.
“ He had a multi - channeled knowowork called Scenes from Western Culture.
He declared it in a simple way."
Assrun says that he described the work as deadly and decades from Western people’s everyday lives.
“ He had sketches of all the visions he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
The Senan that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in should show a young intercontinent pair of love in a minimal room.
“ These are associations with the beginning and end, ” says Atli.
The couple did not know much, even though they knew about him and he knew about them, “but they knew us and felt that they were fitting in this.
They had the words that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people, but people who would get sex from performing for others."
They urged Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“ When we got out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and all his team," says Azrun and Atli.
"This is about love and love"
Senan was taken up to a fine apartment on the Miergate.
There was a very small movie team; a captain, Ragnar, a musician, and the couple.
After the recording had been ticked, all left the room to wait in a car except Atli and Ásrun.
“ We hadn’t decided how we should be.
We received some instructions, but we tried to forget some time and place.
To be unaware of what we were doing and for each one.
It was nothing, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Azrun.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, this was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Azrun agree.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a fine hotel in Paris."
The team was satisfied with the pair’s performance in the work that moved them.
"When Tommi was watching this, he cryed, he felt so beautiful," says Atli.
“ It is as much about love as the neighbor as the associations themselves, ” says Azrun.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and say to Atli that his mother heard the voice of the son in the List Library of Reykjavík and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and begins to go into this, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "Good to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Assrun recalls.
And would the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between the Assur and Atla?
“ At least we are still together, so this may have deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with the family,” says Azrun and laughs.
Assrun himself saw the job in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else, ” she says and turns to her husband.
“ But it was fun to see this because this is just one sentence in a much bigger work, and when you saw it with the other works, it is very nice.
I could cut a little away from this, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Azrun, who was pregnant by the other child of the couple when the sea was taken up.
"This was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to the Assruna and Atla in Love Stories at Council 1.
Swansea with victory in the previous final game
Swansea won 1-0 victory of Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the final outline of the turnover to get into the English Decoration.
The game went to the home of Swansea in Wales.
The half-game status was 0-0.
Homes in Swansea received a 64 - minute hell, but Andre Ayew failed the archaelics and was defended.
Only two minutes later, the red map was given to Rico Henry, actor Brentford.
Brentford, therefore, played the rest of the gamed man less, and in the 82th minute of the new Swanse players.
Andre Ayew then added the Vita chamber by cutting a great target and guaranteed Swansea 1-0 victory.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the enemy, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
For five years from the year 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. Ambassador in Iceland, is in the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed lifeguard in fear of his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors in this country.
Since the United States Ambassadors in April 2009, Carol Van Forst has been unamitted in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Forst had a special position, but Kastlys reported that she should have received the false word in 2009.
On the way to a greeting meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international communication with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Forst’s successor came to work, in September 2010.
In some ways, Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador, but he resigned.
Finally, Loius Ariega had served for decades in the field service.
Then, in the fall of 2013, he resigned to the office of Ambassador in Guatemala.
Then the second time of embassy took place.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Assembly in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but no ambassadors had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Baracks Obama.
He left his jobs as soon as Donald Trump accepted the presidential office of January 20, 2017, as is the custom of a politically appointed ambassadors.
Trump government was unusual to appoint both ambassadors and high officials in the Washington government system.
So it took two years until the U.S. Assembly proclaimed Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him from and confirm it as an Icelandian ambassador.
In his witness at a congress, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who died, had been broken from a Dutch mountain.
Gunter, formerly a skin doctor in California, has been prominent in the Jewish organizations of the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The game owner Sheldon Adelson set up a organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassadors had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of a country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s control was to include people in key offices, and in recent years, the work of the U.S. Assembly has been intensely reduced, including confirming ambassadors in official offices.
Thus, since 2009, there has been a total of five years without ambassadors in Iceland.
However, it has not prevented executions on the roads of the ambassador that recently opened the headquarters at Engateig.
The operations are considered to have cost about 6.5 billion, but knob-tight safety walls cover the building, and a hollow glass is in all windows.
However, it seems not enough to fill the current ambassador’s feeling of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has desired a armed lifeguard.
Former IBV player had racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former player IBV, said he was racism when he was in Iceland and he regrets his coming to the country.
This is seen in a interview with Tonny, which appears on the Ugandian Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who plays in Uganda's top department.
In the Daily Monitor interview, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country, which he played with IBV, Val and Development in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I was used to play.
The leader of the team was in that position, but he was also with the trust number I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the playtime with IBV.
Among what Tonny talks is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem for many black players when they play in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I did not understand the language, I ignored just what was told me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
Then he told me that my opponent had made a racist pronouncement fall about me after I tempted him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not been able to join Haugesund’s initial team, but he wanted to play more to get to the country team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on a loan, but he went to the side of Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have been given the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably come further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has broken out his dreams of getting into Europe's large team.
Found a worm in a woman’s neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 cm of a long black worm in the throat of a woman looking there.
Doctors successfully pulled the worm out with a tight.
A study revealed that there were parasites.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashim a few days earlier, which are the thin meat cuts.
The woman soon improved after the worm was removed, but such creatures are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi lays to bed in the Western countries, cases where parasites have been brought into people have increased.
Fearing Other Waves Starting in Europe
Spania is now in the burn of concerns about the second wave of the Crown Virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-establish the spread of the Crown Viral Age.
In Catalonia, there are more cities than Barcelóna, where infections increase.
Other European countries have also taken action as a result of the increase in pollution in Spain, but in Britain, everyone has to be infected at home from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned on travels to Spain.
Infections are also increasing again in France and Germany, since governments are trying to find balance in restraining the virus's spread and re-economic life.
However, Europe’s situation is good compared to other parts of the world, but global infections are nearing 300 thousand a day, where the most infected in America and South Asia are considered.
According to John Hopkins University, 16 million have been established worldwide, and 644 thousand deaths have been confirmed to be associated with the virus.
Mosaic Deeds Eventually Enjoying
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík, there is a large and deep hole.
Below it, men with orange helmets.
There's also a big grave.
And more less work machines.
The street is closed before passing.
Yet, the circuit is qualified, and many people are now standing and viewing the artworks of millions of mosaic tiles — just as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it is not respected.
The job has been hided right before it were parking places that were always entrusted.
People lay there, locked the car in a quick hurry, and then jumped to take care of their business in the city.
The "living and diversity of the public" and "attracting city tastes" are a guide to the current reconstruction of the Security Guard.
The goal is to glorify the area and to allow the Mosaic work of Making a Holy daughter in the Tollhouse to enjoy a better vision.
Besides the work, there is a place and where the area is well at the sun, it is considered suitable as a dwelling area for roadmen.
The artwork will be highlighted and the materials will now enjoy better than before on this 142 square meters [142 square meters].
In the area, there are also small “smooth sprays, ” some kind of water sculptures, offering up and giving the area certain secrets.
In this way, the replacements are described by Reykjavík City, which is currently implemented in combination with Vita.
Water vessels, heaters, and electrical power stations will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the school plans and the coal waters have been from 1925 and have served in the midst of towns and businesses in less than a century.
When the gate is reopened at the end, cars can drive it back.
However, it becomes a pathway, and at the same time it creates more quiet and accessible space for the walking one.
According to a research on the customs office’s web of the customs manager, the house was used in 1971, but its architect was Geisli Halldór’s son.
Because there were 250 square meters of windowless wallpapers through the house.
The construction committee and architect agreed that such planes would have a bad impact on the total hole, if not special measures were taken to decorate the house’s appearance.
Parties, therefore, agreed to calculate by setting up a permanent artwork there.
At that time, a great word was made by a artist’s daughter, Gera, said in the summary.
If she had worked a lot for musical works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was intended to contact her first before deciding whether it would be possible to compete for the job.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the harbour, because the harbour had been a lifeborn Reykjavík since it was made.
When she was discussed with her artistic woman, she became tricked by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
She had the time she had to make, and when she returned home, she presented some suggestions for her discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
In addition, it was desired to make an overall agreement with her and the famous artwork company in Germany, the brothers Oidtmann, but Ger Ger Gerd had long worked with them to set up artworks throughout Europe.
Contracts were concluded and the artwork was made under the construction of the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of a setup in the Tollhouse.
All the work was very well done, both by the half of the Holy daughter and by the Oidman brothers, says the summary.
Since then, it has endured an unpleasant Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to do the work that was done and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
Two years after the customs work was completed, she died, only 47 years old.
Preparing the shipment of other strains to land
Asmundur Einar Dadason, a social minister, proclaims that more official institutions will be transferred to the country next.
This was said by a minister in the phase of explosion on the wave at noon.
Recently, the burning area of the House and Human Agency was reported to be transferred north of the Sheep Arc to the fall.
Six specialists in the field of burning are working at the Agency, but none of them intends to follow the North Institute and have the National Association of Firefighters and Nurses criticised the transport of livestock.
“ I think we should take further steps in this being.
I'm preparing further steps in this being.
More transport," said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that the majority of the nation want to see the greater distribution of officials throughout the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of official work to land, as I was doing with a House and a Human Agency,” said Ásmund, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to land and made a great deal of importance for communities in the country, such as transportation of a Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland's land measurements to Akraness and employment security at Skagastrain.
All of the most important from the second day of the Master's Congress
Iceland's Meisterst Meeting in Free Sports ended today on Akureyri.
On the second day of the race, a number of contests were set.
It was calculated with an exciting rivalry in the most exciting women in the Third World, but Viggis John’s daughter from FH set Iceland’s met in the worst in 2014, until Elizabeth Ruth Run’s daughter from IR added an estimated May last year.
Viggis won the Iceland's rate back earlier in summer and has been in fantasy in the late, but it has tribited Iceland's estimates.
Elishabet Ruth has suffered injury and has not reached a strike today.
She had only one valid cast of five, throwing 25,69 feet [25,69 m], far from her best.
Vigdis was thrown a long time today, or 60,08 feet [60.08 m] in her last attempt and immediately put a contest.
She set its Icelandic measurement earlier in July, 62,69 feet [62,69 m], but she was something from that.
Godrun Karitas Hallgrím’s daughter from IR had the next best cast of the day, but she improved its best success with a cast up to 50,18 feet [50 m].
In a group of men, Hilmar Örn Johnsson, an Icelander, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last cast and set a contest.
His Icelandic measurement in the article is 75.26 feet [75.26 m].
The God of God’s Son of God, Olympics, and Iceland’s Metherian in the circuit, worked in a bullet TV last night, but today he competed in a circuit that is his main article.
The Icelandic measurement of the Gods of Vals is 65.53 metres [65.53 m], which he was thrown at a maximum of 59.13 metres today and guaranteed its victory.
The next day, Valdimar Hjalt Erlendsson was thrown, with one valid cast in the second seat, 49,43 meters.
Hafdís Victory daughter, an Icelandic Metherian in a long-distance, won the long-distance race with superficial features, but Hafdís jumped a maximum of 6.25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from its Iceland measurement.
In the 200 meters of the women's race, it was the IR God-saving Jonah Bear-daughter who was the most blowsome, but she came to the target in 24,04 seconds, but her Iceland measurement in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Jonah’s gods were victorious on Akureyri, who won two golden prizes yesterday, a 100 - metre race and a 4 - 100 metres [4 x 400 metres] tender race today.
In a male group, Kolben Höfer Gunnarsson from FH first was in the 200 meters of the race in 21,57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Monna Samuel’s son from Årmann.
Like the God - saving of Jonah, Kolbeen won gold for 100 meters yesterday as well as for the 400 meters of the race.
Do not get guilt for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Executive Committee has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who claimed to be guilty of a person for undercovering its funding girls who had been found for sale on the Bitcoin electrical coin.
The statement concludes that the tax investigator had not given clear evidence of the need to blame man.
The Committee's decision shows that the tax investigator considered that the man had places of material wrong tax statements due to the accounting years 2016 and 2017.
He would have mispronounced his financial makers who were in existence because of the sale of Bitcoin’s electrical coin up to 27 million, either willingly, or by a magnificent shepherdlessness.
Debt the man for his manner.
So the man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
However, he agreed to sell an electrical coin for 27 million in 2016.
In 2009 and 2010, he would have had been buried when such things would have been easy and incomplete with a normal home computer.
He then pointed out that when he sold the electrical coins, tax operations for such sales would have been considerably unpredictable.
At least it could have been expected that public citizens would recognize such arrangements in tax pronunciation.
He would not have meant to avoid paying taxes from the harvest, and he would have recognized his property in a statement as an inexpensive account.
He would have asked both experts and government tax managers about how this would be, but without success.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
Hence, he would have been in worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities had not made a clear view of.
Thus, the man believed that his taxes for these two accounting years would be redetermined and stressed, but otherwise not being punished.
Then he repeated that he was working in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country from 2012.
He would never have meant to escape his duties in an unqualified manner.
The requirement of guilt would be fully moderate and would put him in debt.
“ This man understands what football is ” is an advocate
Andersen Willumsson has been considerable between the teeth of people, but also impressed because of its conduct what is left with the Breit Moment in the Pepsi Max department.
Flashes will be in the fireline tonight when they receive IA in direct broadcasting on Station 2 Sports.
Then, because of the four reminders of the season, a branch will take out the play ban and will not come to play with new cuts, as in the summer games so far.
He had been able to write "bla, bla, bla" on his point for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but when talking about character, this was better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball for every time and if there was someone going to balance this game, I thought he would do it or create it," said Godmund Benedictsson in the Pepsi Max Strip, when thought to be fought to the Brynowl.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ Sometimes it is hard to realize what his position is.
He looks a little out on the left when it begins to feel at the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said the Herfar Season.
The Dorkel Mond Peter’s son says to Brynilf, and he rejoices to have such a colorful person in the branch: “Nobody is disputing about this being character.
This is a fun type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There's incredibly a lot of people busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what football is.
“ I am a entertainment force.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and like it."
The people are reading the interviews with the Brown River, people pay in and watch what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Mond.
A player of the KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in touch with some teams in the B department"
Tobias Thomsen, player KR in the Pepsi Max Department, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media of Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Danmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the home country’s period, but to do so, he must first quit his contract at KR, where the Danish department begins before the Icelandic likeness.
The company knows that I miss Danmarks and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in his conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with some teams in the B department and I will probably change before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract with KR."
He then says that he is likely to have a wage reduction in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably felt more the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland.”
The bike whisper Brightness has recovered a bike for millions - now answered for itself after the DV report
For more than a year, Leo’s Starfish has been different from the majority of others.
He cleans up and saves lost and stolen wheels, electric bikes, and wallets.
Have Brightmen gained the name “The Whistle of Bicycles ” for the year.
Yesterday, when a person published an account of his dealings with Brightness, he became so excited.
Then DV pointed to discussions on the Facebook group of Western Beachs, where it appeared that Brightness took the man to speak in the East Valley and said that the baggage might be stolen.
It was only possible to read from the original writings of the electronic man that Brightness taught him to die.
The text has now been modified on Facebook and the title of original news DV has been updated accordingly.
Brightness says original news of the matter at all not a description of what was really going on yesterday in the East Valley.
Bearers said that they have received information from the victims of electropathy that these were truly their electrical tubes.
The information was measured by the owner of others, but the information appeared to be wrong, says Brightness.
“ I looked at the guy, and I knew of the truck, with information that there was an electric truck that had been missing very long and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shuttle, I decided to stop talking to the man.
The owner was sure for his sake, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general I am very fine in such a matter, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken the word of me."
Brightness says that the man on the electrophone had likewise invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called to the police.
“ Yeah, great, ” said Brightmar, “we just get this clear. ”
Then the owner of the electrical cable proved possession of his electric cable and went.
Later, as reported in the first news, the right owner of the electronics told about his history on Facebook.
In this longer year, the Brightness of his practice says that he can count the times that he encountered on the side of people on his fingers.
“ I have had peaceful dealings with the hardest men, ” said Stars, “they are the most frequently smallest brothers and sisters of the community, drugs, psychiatric people, and other people who are somehow on the street.
“ Drug is a hard master, and at some point the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately, thiefing is easy to reach that goal, ” says Brightness.
“ My dealings with these people are really so good that I have many of those good people with me.
Examples are that people have taken care of themselves and then looked to me and helped me with what I am doing, ” he says.
In general, Bjartmar is communicating with riding bicycle people in courteous notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle numbers, and so on.
Rail - stealing is a major problem that has not been discussed.
In addition, Brightness says that even the police have started pointing people to talk to him because of stolen wheels.
Brightness is inconsistent with the previous news transport of DV and does not claim to be an independent policeman in personal search for justice.
Asked if he wasn't yet at the throat of ice by his actions, and whether this is not the most important role of the police, says the Brightness certainly.
“ Of course, the cops should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cop is simply not doing so.
I have to take a look at cops driving away from a big rock of stolen bikes.
She's just said unmay in these matters."
“When the cops are not doing anything in this, and this is just in the face of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve a success in this class of matters, why not?” says Brightness.
He claims that he has achieved such a great success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he is hitting on his “residents ” on the street that they only had the right Brighter wheels they had previously reached.
The times that Björtmar has called for police assistance have just made it uncomfortable.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owner of the bike to blame, ” said Brighters, and I’m sorry that the victims of the railroad thieves have to suffer from the emptyness of the police in this class.
The results of Björn are not divided.
In many cases, stories of people can be found thanks to Brighter for reaching their possessions again.
Even says Bright Bears have long lost the number of bikes he has returned, but the amounts are naturally running on millions, if not millions of days.
A heavy weight of electricity, cycling, and electric cycles, but a cycling may cost less than half a million.
Brightness works in the school on the day, and every other weekend he works in a cohabited home.
His search for a bicycle is, therefore, an unpaid work that he does during his vacation.
Life - treasures and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a lot of birthday years in the history of Iceland's lifelong treasures.
It is true that officials had been retired from Danah’s king all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919, a treasure was established by officials who finally became the treasure of the life of all officials.
The foundation for the current lives of the general payers was then placed in 1969 with a total army of nuclear contracts on the labour market, where a job-dependent life-eye treasure was charged with a duty and a complete collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, the laws were then established on the basis of these contracts, and the life - peripheral system continued to grow after that.
Labour life system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century work movement led to its nuclear fight.
Unemployment insurance had been in a similar way in historical actions in 1955, as well as gradually achieved its demands for sickness and sickness, substantial leave rights, shortages of working time, improvements in home affairs, and more as much.
All these rights took a great and strict struggle but, after thinking, there was a much greater and lasting reduction than the increase in the yields in the wage surgeon, which was as hard as far as the price inflammation that marked the period after war and until 1990, as many remember.
In 1969, the attraction to the Organization of Global Earnings was both long and complicated.
Even though the fact that the funds were actually owned by a social society, the work - genocide movement agreed that their governments would be equally appointed representatives of professionals and social partners.
In the next few years after the facility of the facility, the majority of the workers in the government of the fees were often discussed in the organizations of a payer, but it never achieved its success, so we still have the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the councils are not in the majority of the governments of the fees.
Paragraph 36 of the Law No 129/1997 on the obligations of the rights of life and the functioning of livelihoods deals with the investment policy of the treasuries.
The first figure says that “the interests of the social partners should be led by a treasure of life. ”
The 5th figure also says: “A treasure of life must set moral standards in investment. ”
The shareholdership policy of the Buyer's Liquidity Course includes the following regulations, following the abovementioned laws:
The Cost of Life is part of the United Nations Regulations (UN PRI) on responsible investments, along with many of the largest livelihood and professionally established Western and Europe.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social matters and good governance companies can contribute to improved investment results.
In this way, the interests of investment and the goals of society are combined in a broader context.
The LV considers it important for companies, particularly those registered on the market in shares, to adopt a public policy: to maintain a good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The life coastal value, which has the largest resources in the country, has established a “policy for responsible investments” and there are similar regulations.
All of this is recalled here as the introduction to the latest fashion word of the Icelandic, “shadow management. ”
Since the word is new in this matter, it is not hope that it has been defined in detail, but it seems to me that the following definition is now “the most taken”: Shadow management is when a council leader in the media says that he is going to send the representatives of the Society in the management of a life allowance or instruction on how to take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be disfellowshipped by first fitness.
However, if the leader does not bring this into the media and does not speak of discouragement, it is not a “shadow control, ” but, of course, human relations are always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave the reader to consider the way he feels “shadowed. ”
In particular, two men have tried to form this definition when it is written, on Saturday 25 July 2020.
They are the Harden Eigisson journalist of the newspaper and Asgeir Johnsson bankruptcy director.
The reason for both of them was that Bogi Nils Bogason had said to Icelandair that he had decided to terminate the agreements of the company with airlines and airlines (sing them up), and Ragnar Thór Ingolfsson, President of Reykjavík, sent them the recommendations to the representatives of the Society in the government of Living Lieutenants to not support the possible purchase of the fund on shares in the company, or they might be left to be deviated.
Sometime later, Bogi Nils returned his decision, and then Rachel Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which of course were based on Boga’s decision.
Yet, they saw Harden and Asgeen reason to multiply the matter in the Friday newspaper with great words about shadow control, lawbreaking, and a profound need for changes in laws.
There, indeed, a little duck was to wonder a heavy lace, although the blessed dove had been in an interconnection and was also quickly wiped out.
Since this matter is important, let us consider the matter at the end.
I followed these things in the laws of life - for - life treasures that are underlying this matter.
These include the need for civil interests and moral standards in investment, and these elements are implemented in closer terms in agreements with both the value and the life of the merchants as I mentioned.
However, life - treasures DO NOT only look at short - term losses in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous approach, and it would not be necessary for long to look for examples of such things in the past, since large loans of banks and treasuries have been made up to immoral adventures and environmental sources, with tragic consequences.
President Icelandair was obviously on the necks of ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus drastically decreasing the welfare that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position in relation to investments.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
The time reveals whether it is sufficient to make the investment of life - dealing treasures in society liable for civil society at the time of the rise.
The author is a former professor in physics and science history.
One of the infected practices did not come back
One of the three distinguished with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Eastern Kingdom on July 15, last, about a half week ago.
However, he is an Icelander who is not regularly resident, so he was not given clear instructions to maintain the so - called home - to - home plight after his arrival and to take another exhibition a few days after his arrival.
He got a negative distinction at the border.
“ But he’s in the islandic community, ” says Camilla Josep’s daughter, a psychiatric expert at the Agricultural and local pharmacist during his summer vacation, in conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration format and there is no obligation to record the ID numbers and if the ID is not registered, you will not be proclaimed automatically in the later display.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a foreign resident but because of his connection in the country as an Icelander, he should have used it rather Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
“ When the ID is not recorded, you must seek it yourself to come into the second show.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to strengthen the information giving about this while we find some way to make an auto - preaching system, even though the Icelanders do not record their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, although he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, he is associated with a few.
Only six have been sent to an illness after he had been diagnosed yesterday and all of them were associating with him.
They are going to take a show, but two of them have shown symptoms of Covid-19 infected.
On July 15, the man got negative from his showing at the border.
Camilla is likely to say that he was recently infected by the virus that she was not yet able to detect it when the vision was taken on the border.
However, she does not want to exclude the infected man here in Iceland but not carrying the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that this is surely infected because it is long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little war in connection with the sports conventions. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few man’s associations here.
“ It is really unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but it says that it cannot be excluded until the islandic genetic analysis has been seen in man.
“If we get a virus that has not been seen here before then, it is almost sure that it has brought it to the country. ”
Piper sprays and bombs directed against Protestants
There was a fight between police and Protestants in Seattle this night.
Polices used piparsprey and immortal hand bombs, but Protestants broke rods and turned on.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police servants were hurt.
Police violence and race prejudices were protested in many United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were supported by Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As on BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people met in peaceful protests.
Then, a group of people burned in the building area and broke the pants of the city’s courthouse.
As a result, the police said that the protests were disturbed, and there were conflicts between Protestants and police.
The demand for justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by the police in August last year, remembered by Protestants.
A car ran through a group of Protestants in the city, but there was no injury.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of national guardians gathered together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried weapons and joined arms at closed gates, where the police engaged in the group of protesting Protestants and also carrying weapons.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, footspioneer of Manchester United, does not want to do too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final cycle of the English Division.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, the end of the sunshine and his men in the 5th seat and thus lose from the Master's seat.
However, they should still be hoping to come to the Master Department by working the European Department next month.
“ We haven’t been in line.
If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," said Solskjær.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a great deal in land by reaching the two teams above us,” said Solskjær.
It is evident that human nerves become thunder at 15 a.m. today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that each other game was being played.
“ If you want to be part of Manchester United, you must get used to being under pressure during the last game of the period.
This is nothing new, and it's based on this company.
We have created a great opportunity to end the period well, and now it is ours to use it," said Solskjær.
“ This is not the most important game of the period; this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The end does not define our period; we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed greatly for us, and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solskjær.
65.000 infected by sun ring
65.490 new infected chronic viruses were reported in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4.178.021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in the country.
900 died by the virus yesterday but last four days until the death of the virus was more than 1,000 a day.
In the United States, 146.460 deaths have been confirmed.
CNN reports that, according to the prophecy of the United States, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 August 15th.
Fear the Second Wave of the Episode
Spain's governments are now trying to refrain from the increase in COVID-19 spread in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports come at the same time as the Spanish begin to suspend one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The relapse led to British authorities now to commit passengers from Spain to enter into an infectious state when they returned.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The worst situation in Catalonia, in the northeastern part of Spain, is where governments have taken more wide limits to try to match the level of growth.
In the capital of Barselóna, the next two weeks of entertainment will be closed, and in the midnight, the halls will be closed.
At that time, the exit ban is now valid for 200 thousand inhabitants of Segria County in the western part of Catalonia.
It is thought that Britain’s decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy that is very relied on the coming of foreign travelers and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, the largest British Travel Office, announced all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments in many parts of the world are said to prepare for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be to take back to a widespread expansion ban that has destroyed the economy.
For example, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken a very bad deal with such things as nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
At that time, France’s Prime Minister, Jean Castex, said that the nation “will not survive, economically or socially, ” if it would be taken back to a national ban on exit.
Hoping that many advisors will be able to refrain from the virus in the next traffic if it comes to the inhabitants of a particular city, city, or region.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three inland
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday, plus two more than the border.
Thus five subjects were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infections yesterday in Iceland.
In the reporting of the general survival, one infection is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football contest.
He has been sent in isolation and sixteen who were in close association with him in an infectious state.
The infected person participated in the social work of a athlete in Reykjavík and is, according to the report, “only part of the sports industry” in an illness.
Others who were sent into an infectious disorder are in another way connected with the man.
The origin of these infectious substances is unfounded and infected by the CEO.
ReyCUP’s contestants have followed the instructions and rules of the pharmaceutical and general immune system that are still in force and have been taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the assembly brought attention, which could be seen in a very close association to celebrate its good team in the field.
Right before 11 a.m. today, the contestants published the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says: “Ath: Parents kindly respect the rules of picking up their own things at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but was associated with the infection reported this morning.
In the notification, “Islandic genetic analysis has seen the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
It is also infected in isolation and infected by 12 infectious diseases.
The third infected thing is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
The one is now in isolation and six who were closely associating with him in an illness.
Two of them have already shown symptoms of virus infection.
In addition, two were detected at the border and were waited for further studies such as a process of infecting the border.
Eventually, the report says: The Head of State Police and the physician officials urge people to take care of individual infectious agents.
There is no doubt whether the Covid-19 symptoms are present, the same one is asked to take a show at the next healthcare station.
Patch feather says the tent area booked about a merchant holiness - Been guests else
The Palestinian Territory is completed during the weekend, according to the western news.
The guests are suggested to consider other possibilities.
The names of the Western Billy Valley, the Talknavland, the Melanes of the Redsand, the Hotel Compocalund, and Hotel Breitavik are the second option in the position.
It is enough to be at the patriarch of this weekend, for as in the past year, the Schild city, a celebration of Icelandic records, will be held in town.
Since 2007, it has become a strong tradition in town.
This year, if the weather does not account for a strike, DV said earlier today about a degradation of prophecy.
However, the worst weather in the south can be expected, and hope for the Palestinians.
The web bb.is first reported, and said that all other places in town were already booked.
A whole multitude coasts down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free on Dunhaga 18-20.
While seeking reconstruction permits, their business has been successful in the system for the third years.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavík City, a glorious multitude is located on three highs.
On the ground floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
The back of the house is a door of two walks, each of which holds four beautiful apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, but mostly over 100.
The house has a considerable story to be stored.
It was built in 1959, including a video lease, the Skoroom, the Milk Sales, Joa’s guns, fish sales, and now the last post.
The house has, as mild as words are taken, remembered its fist beauty.
The house is now under great damage, as shown in the following pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to a company record, Magnus Magnussson and Godrún Helga Lárus daughter.
Magnus was the defendant of the Cash Society.
In the ownership of the Payment Society, Steelships are ehf.
Steelship or the Investment Society of Godrua Lárus' daughter and her children.
Godrun also owns a third part of D18 ehf.
Godrun and her husband, August Godmundur the son of Sigurd, once went out the Steelship.
D18 pp. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so there has been little but nothing since then.
Say to neighbors that the situation of the house has progressively worsened since, though most in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one inhabitant says that the house “wasn’t particularly lively last years. ”
There may be the fact that owners have been trying to change the house and land for a few years.
Other neighbors say that the house has long not been okay.
“ It’s long time to do something generally with this spot, and it’s sad that it’s been pulled like this. ”
He also tells us that he is filled with the owners of the house because he has not done this, found some common flat with the neighbors of the house, and quit this “top of law. ”
“Do this just in consultation with the community around so that it can be done and done. ”
The legal pace, which is intended to refer to, is the organisation process of the field which has been in progress since 2017 at least.
They picked up the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 to build a height above the current multitude and behind the house, a new elevator, and a building on one height, plus a basement.
The Building Authorisation provided for this implementation was declared to the Committee on Environment and Resources, and the Committee rejected it from its validity where the implementation was not supported by a divisional organisation, and the disclosure was not satisfactory.
Reykjavík City then started participatory work and finished it with an advertising in the Governance News in July last year.
That organisation was also accused and the Committee rejected it in March 2020.
At this time, therefore, nearly three years had passed from the initial application for building permits and owners of the house at the initial site.
At that time, the house had suffered considerably, and the neighbors were tired.
When DV asked the neighbors into the situation and reacted to the neighbors, the answers were in a number of ways.
Some had understanding of the purposes of the house’s owner, others at all.
Others directed anger to the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but nothing had to do with anyone.
Others said that the cars were busy, but neighbors have a new unused parking site of Dunhaga 18 - 20 under their vehicles.
One attorney said long - suffering in the government:
“ Let’s go through the triple process is quite unbelievable.
It's like Reykjavík City couldn't read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A memorial of the city’s phase of governance and the precious intentions of the owner and of the many years of work that is now on the start.
When a newspaperman had a garden in Dunhaga 18, he was blown with a galoped door and a garbage.
Playstation computers and recent television were inside another waste on earth — the victims of the Icelandic Summer Battle.
It was opened into the old office of a college paper, where a large number of cats of the smell were judged.
Obviously, someone has screwed around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Snakes of sofas and beds and a few boards of geography magazines, which were likely to be a book, came to pass.
The stairways of the apartment were also open as well as lives in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to meet the inhabitants of one of them.
There the Romanians were buying potatoes for dinner and inviting a journalist in.
The Romanians are working for the Ztrongforce Employment.
They have been there for some time, simulating DV’s sources that the company has not paid for the accommodation except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it does not seem defensible to obtain a rent.
Of the places of mail in the door of the house to be judged, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers in the past.
A company has not been a part of the Covid-19 situation, since a collaboration in the tourist sector leads to a collaboration in the building, and these two industries are the most durable to take advantage of the service of employees.
Yet, homemen in Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the jobs and tailors in the property were hired to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the bad condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist claimed the boys to be in the room, he suddenly became clear of the athlete: At the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of property is defeated.
Owners want to change the house to improve, and neighbors want to improve the situation but to share the definition of “benefit. ”
Between the city's organisational field, the victims of endless prosecution, and the organisation process's choices and the visions of the Committee on Environment and Resources.
In the house, then, sleepy workers, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article appears originally in the weekend magazine DV 17 July.
To fight against overweight following chronic viral age
The British presidency, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on prompt advertising, following his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
At present, Johnson presents the campaign that has been called better health tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign encourages physicians to prescribe cycling for their refugees in overweight and will also be attacked in the event of an increase in cycling.
Then, according to British media records, advertisements on television will be prohibited for at 21 o’clock.
“COVID-19 has raised us with regard to the short and long-term risks of overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthy, active and eat healthy food”, says the spokesman of the government.
Johnson himself had to deal with a gravity problem, but he was put in the guard when he was infected by the crown virus in the spring, and is partly to his weight because he is considered to have become so seriously sick.
Women Become Better to Lead Changes
She said that the new governance was the largest step that the nation could take towards more power, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the overall interests.
“ We need to change a bit now, and who is more likely to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s position.
Standing together and keeping together leading changes.
So now we're just about to lead these changes."
She said she was a little anxious about the emphasis in Iceland as “best in the world ” in both sex and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to consider what to do.
Like Germans, they are very conscious of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming, knowing the story and listening.
Listen to the voices of the adjacent groups.
We don't have the same rules all here," said Helga.
As asked, she said that women were in many ways in good business in Iceland, but added that, as in many other lands, the Icelandic population had a huge male value.
She said that politics were about to form their own interests, authority, and powers that were the forces that maintained wrongs in all society.
“ Women have now set up this group, gathering together, and have just become a little irritated about the fact that the Almighty will move to overlook this 2012 national voting fee, ” she said.
“ It’s these female values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and natural protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all really at the same level," she said, adding that the previously mentioned values are the basic values of the new governance file.
“ We are a very rich land of natural humility, and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide differently," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women are always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that airlines and nurses have to stand in a chamber struggle forever only to achieve human rewards."
The signature list of the new management file can be signed here through Electronic Iceland.
Trying to rob a walking streetman in the city centre
A man was arrested in the city center this night after he threatened walking roadways and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Aurby, where two were arrested for the matter.
Then the police stopped the motorcycle driver in the Hoids, where its driver was at a speed of 146 km, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been similar to driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn tonight, and more than 80 cases were recorded in a police journal from five yesterday to five this morning.
At that time, there was a great deal of noise in the event of meetings.
On Saturday night, there was an announcement of eleven noisy meetings, and it was thought very much of a police journal.
On the other hand, last night 22 noises came on a police board.
Six were stored in a prison cell tonight.
In the town, police were called tonight when members shot firefires.
However, they had escaped when policemen were in the park.
Then nine drivers were stopped for alcoholism and drug trafficking.

Then, after they fell on their face, two were moved to an emergency, one in the city center, and the other in the western town.
One was transferred to an accidental department after he was hurt by jumping on trampoline in Copavog.
In addition, police officers stopped a driver who took a bike at Chalarnesi last night.
According to the police journal, the bicycle equipment was “very bad ” and was still.
Can be stayed in Monet’s house for the saints of shoppers
The house in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his training is now available on the Airbnb page.
The next nights in the house are about the merchant saints.
The house is small and fragile, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.
The painter was living in the house from 1883 until he died in 1926.
The house contains three bedrooms, two sitting rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
At the Airbnb page, it is next free in a week, on Sunday of the sailor sanctuary, so it may be optional for some vacation shoppers to book the house of the painter.
The two nights over the saint of shoppers cost no more than 964 dollars, or just over $130,000, as the newspaper comes next.
Infectious numbs and some of these begin to show the symptoms of the crown virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with the crown virus within the country and most of the infected are unconnected.
Due to this, some of them have shown the symptoms of the virus.
Yesterday, three were diagnosed with the inland crown virus and two at the border.
A specialist in the physician’s office says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spread to the community.
“ There has been a series of distinctions from the former domestic infection, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something newly arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Camilla Sigridur Joseph's daughter, a specialist in the field of pharmaceutical health.
Most of those infected have been associated with people from abroad.
More visualizations occur in the next place than some in association with the infected have shown the symptoms of the chronic virus.
“ Now there is no influenza and less than other respiratory tract infections, so we can be somewhat free - minded by doing these tests on individuals who had found reason to do something else first in the period of influenza, ” said Kamilla.
Infectious estimates are mostly completed, but there is no other need to be infected.
Two of the infected were detected after attending sports events.
Has it raised questions about whether such events can be defendable?
As long as people follow the standards and rules.
Kamilla almost notes that the infected people were infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there is no more isolation from these individuals after having been with them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our infectiousness at the conventions has worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
The public defence charges are being reviewed on a constant basis.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems to be reasonable, ” said Kamilla.
In more than a week, multi - data markets will be extended to a thousand people.
This new situation may affect strokes.

Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared rebellion as a result of numerous oppositions in the city.
Yesterday, the police took a blossom and a pepper spray to try to ruin a large area that Protestants entrusted and stretched over many lengths of houses in the neighborhood of the city’s city.
The police informed Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that a study was conducted at the police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bombing.
Citizens and police authorities say that Protestants stoned police with stones, bottles, bombs, and other loose bombs, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where his injuries were made.
However, the protest in Seattle was peaceful for a long time.
They were blowed up to show Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where the city has repented for severe conflicts between Protestants and depressed federal police.
There, like in other cities of the United States, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter, George Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis, May 25, resists systematic racism in the United States and demands an extension.
Not revoked until after vote
It is not yet necessary to withdraw the reports of Icelandair, which are to take effect for the next month.
Icelandair's electronic vote on the Icelandic Airlines Airlines Agreement will end on noon tomorrow.
Lieutenant Liney John’s daughter, President of the Society, assured that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the conclusions of the vote are made.
“ It's cleverly linked, ” says Godlieg Liney.
“ There has been no withdrawal; this must be made so that human machines can be made available.
So, of course, people are uncomfortable after getting to know if they're going to have work after the monthly convention."
The choosing of a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is assumed to be valid until September 2025 and is based on a previous agreement by airlines.
On 17 July, the Government and Confidential Council of Icelandic Airlines agreed to proclaim a general work stop at Icelandair, societies agreed on a vote fee.
It never came to her, but this was decided after Icelandair's decision to quit conversations with the Airlines Society, quit all its airlines and search for agreements with another company.
At that time, the company’s pilots were to take care of security teams on board temporarily.
Asking how she believes that the vote will go, Godly Lieutenant Liney hard to say about it.
“ After this approach, people are hurt when all the airlines of the Society were dismissed and reported that the agreement would be with another company.
Now it shows whether it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April, 940 missiles worked at Icelandair, and 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their revelations are disadvantaged for those who have the lowest working life, three months, and therefore ends at the monthly conventions of July August.
There are about 90% of Icelandair airlines.
What does the contract not be accepted?
“ Then we wish for continued discussions with our people.
With this contract, we meet Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it's clear that the airlines seem to have gone too far."
The vote on the end of the nuclear agreement and Icelandair presents a second fourth year tomorrow
The airline's vote for a new nuclear agreement will end at 12 a.m. tomorrow.
Icelandair's second quarter is also published tomorrow, while the preliminary extermination results indicate that the company's income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period in the previous year.
A electronic vote on the Airlines Agreement of Icelandic Airlines and the Working Association for Icelandair began on Wednesday 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 a.m. on noon.
Those who are allowed to choose the contract are Icelandair’s employees who pay social expenses to the Airlines.
Icelandair and FII signed a new nuclear agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday before, Icelandair had broken conversations with the company after the airlines collapseed the first vote agreement at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and airlines of the company on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new vehicle contract was signed.
According to a new nuclear agreement, airlines need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic wage.
The atomic agreement is valid until the year 2025, where flighters and airlines have been agreed on how long they can fly on one guard.
The agreement was presented to FIFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many airlines who were discussed by a newspaper office on the grounds of dissatisfaction.
However, most people seemed to agree that it would be necessary to approve the contract to keep FFI alive.
Icelandair's second quarter of year will be presented tomorrow than the EBIT of the Society, its corporate income for funds and taxes, is negative, according to preliminary extermination results, about 100 to 110 million US dollars or about $15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Capital a preliminary calculation last Wednesday, where it stated that the company’s income had reached about $60 million on the fourth or $8.3 billion.
The hand - handed money and its equivalent were about 154 million dollars at the end of the fourth century, about $21 billion.
Icelandair also aims at offering the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair is to conclude contracts with fifteen lending rats, governments and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before submission.
New variance rather than new virus
“ New virus simply means that this has been a person from abroad.
This is not something that has been malling here in the country," says Már Kristján son, a chief doctor of the National Hospital, on the report that “new type of virus” has been identified here in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports community at Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is undefined and infected.
Infections were also diagnosed in individuals who arrived in the country on 15 July, two of them who were in association with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, in yesterday, infected with contamination reported this morning and after a series analysis of the islandic genetic analysis, “new type of virus that has not previously been identified ” was observed.
Infectious toxicity has been completed with it.
It may be argued that it is not a new virus, but that is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 crown virus.
It is better to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new virus.
Asking what it meant, and whether it could say something about the beginning of another epidemic wave, Marr says that as a single case, and it could be so that it could be no more.
“ However, if there are cases of domesticity that are not linked from abroad and have the same genotype as this specific variance, it would be possible to draw the conclusion [of a second wave], but it is untimely to support it, ” explains Mar.
Happiness in the Holy Pot
Is the secret of the happiness of the Icelanders hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC programmakers lead to the likes of a fun video that throws light on the pool and hot pot culture of the country.
The Icelandic bathing population is special in the world, and it is claimed that nowhere in the world is as many bathing places every inhabitant.
The natural heat of the earth is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of divorce that here exists.
In 1940, children’s instruction was legal, but older citizens are equally durable to use the hot water for health improvements.
Disturbances are described as a fixed part of the country’s general welfare.
Everyone in the pot is equal, regardless of the position.
With the mobile phones, people talk on personal notes about home and spaces or use the appreciative power of water: meditate and load batteries of soul and body.
To pick up a hundred days in the election
Hundreds of days are until the Americans choose their president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-chooser, but he's got the brick to pick up.
Joe Biden, the expected Promotor of the Democracy, has a great priority to Trump in the country, taken into account by the surveys.
According to a new study by the AP newsgroup, a number of Americans believe that the nation is wrong.
Trump’s reaction to the world epidemic of the new crown virus is also very hostile, and more Americans than before believe that the president had been disadvantaged in economic affairs.
In detail, only two in ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent say that Trump’s reactions are supported by epidemics, and 48 percent say that he has kept well on economic matters.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January 67 percent.
According to the average of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is followed by 49.9 per cent in the country than Trump 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his attitude to the epidemic of Biden, to promote so - called cultural disputes, and to proclaim policy that should turn to law and rule.
However, Biden’s offer is a strong effort to keep attention to Trump and considers a great chance of bearing a victory if the election is really about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
The opposing Trump also seems to come down to the Republican Senators and fear the Promorates that the majority of the American Senatorial Department could even reach the most, which has so far been very excited.
In the days, Politico told us that it would be comparable to follow classes and offerers, and this is what the Republican group would now receive its greatest disturbance for decades.
It has been particularly bad in the 2016 Assembly elections, and now it seems that this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the population to follow, including by saying that he will become President Biden, he will destroy the outskirts of the United States and promote racial conflicts.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a regulation since the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase the diversity of the outdoors.
Then he urged “mamums ” to deploy the United States to read an article of the former assistant head of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the United States’ outskirts and took Trump into account.
“Wait will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
Inhabitants of the United States are increasingly electing.
According to NPR, they are about half of the choices in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the offerer who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Unless in 2012, Mitt Romney received major votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
Investigations have shown that despite Trump’s assurance, the majority of the districts in 2016 have been significantly shattered.
Although there is a difference between the tests, Biden has been measured with about fifteen percent priorities for Trump in the perimeters in the past.
Regis Philbin's dead

Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the walks?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, events that have only led to world wars until now, the International Olympic Committee’s president said that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the gangs, ” and there expected to be a world epidemic of crown virus that the world - inhabited world is now going through in a united way.
Yields have an additional year to prepare, and the governments in Japan make up their costs due to the delay.
Yet, everyone keeps his head in a lot of trouble.
When announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the spot of the Olympic Games this year, the joy of the Japanese representatives was true.
They were crying and laughing at once, because Tokyo had tried to keep the games in 2016, but it was a lesser part of Rio, Brazil.
At this time, Tokyo City and Japan were devoted to the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24, and August 9, but have been postponed for years, starting on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.
If you are not able to keep your games, if your crown virus is still too threatened, your games will be stopped.
Yet, no one wants to think of that thought to the end.
Olympics are no normal sports competition.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be amazing and seek to top the last games.
The choice of a city for Olympicity is based on the assessment of the election committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation is — the more likely to get the nose.
Tokyo spent 150 million dollars trying to keep the Olympic Games in 2016 or over $20 billion.
The next time, at the time of the 2020 plays, 75 million dollars, about $10 billion, were placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had the plays this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion on the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the sea as well as the cost of building Olympic villages, theaters, and generally strengthening the indoors of the country to manage such conventions, preparing them, and keeping their own plays.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympics in Tokyo, which should have been ongoing these days but have been postponed for a year as a result of the crown virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
In Japan, however, a report published at the end of the last year revealed that the cost was almost double.
It is unlikely that the cost of delaying the games will not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars additional to the original cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
There are so high figures that all taxes in the Icelandic State were due only about half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are events of the size that they have often become the multiply of economicists, who are trying to check figures and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, many seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive to the economy of the cities that hold them.
The short - term effects, for example, increase in jobs very much to a short time, but for a longer period, cities often sit up with debts and threatening costs of small - used manufacturing.
Río in Brazil has a serious debt for the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the maintenance of all the major sports activities built for the games.
According to the London 2012 plays, only 10 percent of those who received employment in the Olympics in the city have been unemployed before.
This means that it was not about new jobs unless in a small way.
In general, cities have not been very good for economically maintaining the olympia because of the disadvantaged cost of man’s works that are built for the games.
However, benefits are often included in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which, however, is very uncertain about the 2021 plays.
Also, it is uncertain whether all the number of attendants that usually attend the plays will be accepted.
However, the main matter is the honor that the cities have to be elected, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
In spite of the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy of the games is not the nature of pricing it.
However, although the show is often awesome and nowhere is saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes in the forefront.
For some successors, it is surprisingly welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five - year - old woman and a gold - payer in her article on the page of Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, who had been a casino and had not been a good fun in summer but hopes to be in the contest for the 2021 games.
It is, therefore, among the athletes who are just rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intend to stop after the games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the delay of the games in some cases means that they stop competition before the games take place.
Just don’t trust his body to go through years in addition to harsh exercises.
A few athletes found themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as well as Simone Biles’ fiction star.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has visited some interviews in his home country in the United States in the past to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's going to the 2021 plays, but she's not sure she'll be still at the top of the games in the next year, and she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered high age, it is in a higher place for a chief woman in the first row.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but it smiles into another interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee asked whether she would reach the 2021 games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’m still on the top after a whole year, ” says Biles.
She has previously spoken that her body does not tolerate the stress that follows sports training much longer.
Yet, she exercises zealously for the 2021 Olympic Games.
Biles acknowledges that it was a discomfortful feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the world pandemic was the highest and the sports hall was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic Gold couldn't buy any access beyond the other, she had to find various ways to remain in shape as others.
Surely, the basic form is better than in most people.
“ We have a tight plan now.
It was hard to start practicing first after the sports hall opened.
We started slowly, but we have come back to full, and I will increase my exercises constantly according to the years.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games are going to be, or whether they are being held, but we do not exercise, even though we can.
I've worked too much to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like many others, a doubt is blurred, or perhaps rather conscious that the situation may occur that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
However, predicting that is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation in the world epidemic of the crown virus will be in July 2021 and nothing but preparing for the Olympics in the year.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be the light at the end of the Covid walks.
Deferred Marriage Due to Epidemia
The modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was to marry the former Bachelorette contester Wells Adams this summer.
“ I think there are other more important things to think about accurate now, ” said the actress in conversation with People.
“ We would like to marry sometime and have a dream wedding and all the attendants who love us.
But we decided to take this time and focus on what is important today, helping to share information about the importance of being with masks and staying at home.
I look more at the world than the wedding languages of these days.
There's a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
