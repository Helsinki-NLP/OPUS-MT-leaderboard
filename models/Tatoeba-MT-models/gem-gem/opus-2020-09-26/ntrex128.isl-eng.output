Welcoming counselors are worried about “like a fool ”
Some ministers suggest that their title be transformed into MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, members of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have come because of the plan to change the Council’s name into the Welfare Congress.
Advocates of all categories are worried about the fact that this could make them laugh.
One manager of the worker class said that his group was worried that “twp and Pwp are in trouble. ”
For readers who live outside of Wales: in Welsh means twp wrong, and pwp means beast.
A director of the Plaid Cymru group said that the total group was “dissatisfied ” and made other suggestions to the name.
A councilman of the Welsh Containment Group said that his group had an “open mind ” about the change of name, but pointed out that there was no significant difference between the word MWP and Muppet (floon).
In this context, it can be noted that the well - being w is presented in the same way as you in English.
The Council, who is now working on a lawyer to submit the name changes, said: “The final decision on all the names that are headed over members of the Council will, of course, lie with the members of the Council itself. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the goods authority to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public survey that showed great support for calling the Council the Welsh Congress.
The WMP (Welsh Parliament Members, Welsh Senators) chose, as regards the title of the Council of Ministers, but MWP received the greatest support of the public in the surveys.
According to the news, advisors now make other suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the Council, Elin Jones, who should submit the basis for changes within a few weeks.
The initial reform will also include other changes in the work of the Board, including rules on the withdrawal of the Secretary and the Committee's Organization.
When discussions begin, counselors will be able to pay their final titles.
Macedonian people vote in elections for the country’s name change
The choosers will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country into the "Amt of Northern Macedonia".
This issue was understood in an attempt to resolve a decades of dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, who has its own territory with the name Macedonia.
The city of Athens has long claimed that their neighbours in the north are equivalent to their territory and have repeatedly protested their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, which is inconsistent with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, the supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the value that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s Church Clock, Harlem’s Churches are in trouble
“ The elderly people I have spoken to said that before then there was a bar and a church in each corner of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is no one there."
He said it would be understandable that the beasts would decrease.
"The people have other ways to meet," he said.
“ Children are no longer the centers of the neighborhood, where people meet regularly. ”
As regards the churches, he is concerned that the funds that come from sales will not only be as long as leaders are expected to “and sooner or later they will be back to the original place. ”
He added that churches might be replaced by a apartment house that was full of people who will not help save the next places of refuge.
“ The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white, ” he said, “and therefore will haste for these churches to be closed forever, for it is unlikely that most people who move to these apartments will be members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black - Metropolitan Community church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church decades later.
In the 1940 ’ s, the original white Medical Congregation moved away.
A congregation of black people who had served in the neighborhood took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over St. Martin’s church under the direction of prince John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to dismiss shoppers in 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping gate, who desired to administer or give them positions.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged in fire, but members of Serge Johnson’s congregation did plans to rebuild it, and they also made the watch game.
Serge David Johnson, son of Johnson, called the watch game proud “the clock of the poor people. ”
The specialist who played the watch game in July called it another name: “Principality ” and“ a unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also argued that this was the first watch game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved to a larger watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin hadn't got anyone else in his place.
Last month, many architects and actors have taken their way to St. Martin, some of the leaders of the church and others of the Bishop region.
The church council, who is appointed church leaders, wrote the Bishop region in July and declared its concerns about the Bishop’s “tourism seeking to overcome the cost ” of the church council, even though it had not taken part in the architect’s and the agents’ recommendations sent by the Bishop Counsel.
Some attendants complained about the lack of transparency of the Bishop region.
A shark hurts 13 - year - old boy who broke after a cum in California
According to the authorities, a 13 - year - old hay attacked him and hurt him on Saturday when the boy was dying for a cum in California on the first day of the humar fishing period.
The attack became right before 7: 00 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then ripped over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought that it was just an excitement to reach a cumber, but then “he realized that the boy shouted:“ I was bitter!
I was biten!"
All the bone on him was ripped," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Rady Child Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously wounded.
It's not known of the type of shark that attacked the boy.
At a media meeting, Larry Giles, head of the coastal guard, said that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed coastal access from the Ponto Beach coast in Casablad to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety.
Giles said that more than 135 different types of sharks were in the area, but most of them do not consider dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to have a wide range of cleaning products in Britain
Sainsbury’s is going to take care of Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenham’s with tailor stores in the center style and with specialist assistants.
This is part of the plan for entering the British Carriage Market, which is 2.8 billion pounds worth and grows increasingly while sales of fashion and household goods are declining. The larger carriers are tested in 11 shops across the country and are placed in more shops next year if they are successful.
Investment in clothes is part of a large-scale way to use a shilling lock that was previously new to TV, microwave ovens, and home goods.
Sainsbury’s claims to double their selection of goods in up to 3000 product species, including trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The shop also intends to re-sale its Boutique product selection so that the majority of the lips are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test a warehouse in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Networking and the increased tendency of consumers to buy a small amount of food every day in the neighborhood business means that large markets need more effort to make people come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, conductor of Sainsbury, said that the sales would be more and more similar to commercial centres when the shopping chain is trying to fight against the low - merchandise stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and other goods than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos camps in hundreds of shops and has also introduced numerous Habitat camps since both chains were purchased two years ago, according to which it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt of the shop to survive its clothing and medicine departments did not succeed well.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000, so it ended because of a dispute on how to share the sales of medicines in the large markets.
The new policy follows that Sainsbury sold its 281 pharmaceutical shops to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd product sales, for 125 million pounds ago three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these programmes by adding a large selection of luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Sainsbury’s market manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: “We have transformed our looks on our shelves to improve the environment for our clients.
We have also invested in special training for employees who will be in hand for advice.
Our selection of goods is designed to meet all needs. A delicious environment and comfortable locations make us an exciting shop of goods that transforms old shops."
Peter Jones' "intention" after Holly Willoughby terminates a 11 million pounds contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den elements, became “awning” after the TV scientist Holly Willoughby terminated a 11 million pounds contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home warehouse and accompanying warehouse brands, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s trademark.
Willoughby, a 37 - year - old student in the sections This Morning, announced his decision at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has declared Peter Jones, the Star of Dragons’ Den, afterwards painful by stopping participation in popular lifestyle companies in the last hour to focus on new and profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Authorities say that Jones has been “indignant ” at a difficult meeting on Thursday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the television woman popularly admitted that she did not have enough time for the Truly homeware and accompanying product brand because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s trademark, and was intended to double the property of Willoughby, their estimated value is 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, a 37 - year - old, informed Instagram that she was going to withdraw from Truly, Jones from Britain flyed to stay in one of her summer homes.
A author reported: “Truly was the longest priority for Holly.
This was to be her future project, which would bring it to the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely open to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Thursday, so short that the line would be marketed.
There's a full layer of lips in Marlow's headquarters that are ready to sell."
Experts believe that the elimination of this morning, among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost millions of the company due to large stock mountings, from pumps and candles to clothing and home goods, and may cause further delays in selling the line.
This could also mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been a friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly, together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined the presidents in March.
The pairs spend their summer holidays together, and Jones has 40 percent of the share in Baldwin, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV component manager I'm a Celebrity.
Last night, a author of close Jones said, “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Difficult discussions “and then we became in love”
He looked at the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider unappropriate to the President, and for being so positive to the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Said Trump and simulated the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't left anything."
He argued that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards nuclear weapons North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions on detention of nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, chief Ambassador of North Korea, said to international leaders at the SD General Assembly on Saturday that the north had not been “admissible” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear weapons.
He said that instead, the United States continued to engage in business relations to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his meeting talk.
"We are very happy to meet North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have given up positive results - fireplace tests, hostages had been released, and the earthly remnant of American soldiers was returned home.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It is so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter a trembling scene, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing out the people in front of themselves.
Flows and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage on the island, hundreds have died
For example, after the earthquake in Lombook, international assistance organizations were told that they were not needed.
Though more than 10 percent of the people of Lombok had to flee from their homes, there was no necessity declared, but that is the requirement for the international association of aid there.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they have stated that they are not going to ask for international aid, so this is difficult, ” said Mrs. Summung.
Although the Organisation Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still unlikely when foreign assistants can begin working in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, an advocate of the National Emergency Agency, said that Indonesian councils are appreciating the situation in Palu to see if international associations should be allowed to assist in the assistance work.
As a result of the widespread earthquakes in Indonesia, the land is sadly unprepared to defend natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, which is rarely seen at other beaches.
It seems that, even if a warning was published, there is still an increase in the fall of humans in Palu’s floods.
Even in the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters make organization even more complicated.
A medical ship that has been laying at the port of Lombok for the victims of the earthquake is now on the way to Pala, which will take at least three days to get to the new location of the accident.
President Joko Widodo made the most important features of his election campaign to rebuild the downgraded roadways of Indonesia and has put a lot of money in the way and railways.
However, a shortage of funding has affected Mr. Joko’s control, but elections will be held in the next year.
Mr. Joko also has to face persistent tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where the majority of the Muslims have developed a more sustained religious policy.
Over 1,000 people died, and thousands of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims struggled in streets with swords, bows, arrows, and other basic weapons.

The shortest British Congress of Cromwell is the latest memo that is accused of “Rewriting the History”
The ban of the map would be the poetic justice of the Taliban destruction of his persecuted Purite followers on so many cultural and religious devils of England.
On the other hand, the Cromwell Society said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was "small" and "try to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion on removal of cards, it was inevitable to avoid the shortage of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
The Andoph of the English Civil War against the Culture Symbols was not a command or execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas in the past.
The magnificent map of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a sign of the 19th - century era and is part of the history of a man who many believe that he still deserves praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps late in the 19th century rather than today, has been the protector of the Congress against external pressure in his case of the kingdom.
There is still a great historical dispute about the fact that this description is entirely correct.
However, the conflicts in the mid - 17th century have shaped our nation’s development and Cromwell is known as a representative of one side of their struggles.
It is worth greeting and remembering his accomplishment as a protector of the kingdom."

The remnant of Rosa’s turbulence brings great results over the southwestern part of the United States
As foretold, the strength of the constellation rose decreases when it crosses the cooler sea at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring a great debt that could cause floods in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next days.
Rosa became a molecule of Class 1, with wind strength up to 136 km a hour, at 5 a.m. until the eastern time on Sunday, and was located more than 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa is going north on Sunday.
At the same time, it is lowered in the formation of the Pacific and will go eastward to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja Californian shake on Monday as a tropical storm, then a huge tropical rage will follow north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will follow up to 25 cm of descendants in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical range will be mixed with the nearby low and will form a large and widespread descendant over the southwest part of the next days.
Locally 2.5 to 10 cm descendants may cause hazardous fluids, soil movement and possible steps in the desert.
A large tropical raft will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of descendants in some places, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be up to 5 to 10 cm of descendant in some places in the southwestern part, especially in most of the Arizona county.
There is a possibility of rapidly degrading situations because of the spread of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised not to walk into the wilderness when there is a risk of tropical rain.
High rain can turn gils into blowing rivers, and thunderstorms can result in a windstorm and dust storms.
The closer to it will carry local waste in certain areas at the Southern California coastline.
There is a potential of more than 1 cm of descendants that could cause a small movement of the soil and the throat on the road.
This is the first descendant of the area during the rain period.
Some distributed tropical cows will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the descendant spreads over larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great deficiency will spread over four states on Thursday and will end on Wednesday.
Due to the colding of the Northern Scotland, the tropical world is expected to have a great temperature change everywhere in the United States.
Sometimes this can cause great fever fluctuations over short distances.
In the Middle Americas, there was a very good example of a great heating difference on Sunday.
There are nearly 7 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days will try to build up and re-distribute the remaining summers.
It is expected that large parts of the Central and Eastern United States will begin with a warm start on October with a temperature of around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeastern.
At Thursday, the temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast indicates that there are great risks of temperatures above the average for the eastern part of the United States in the first October.
Over 20 million people watched hearings over Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people looked at the exciting witness of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, on Thursday and the witness of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual fraud that should have occurred in the 1990 ’ s.
At the same time, the political atmosphere continued, and television stations interrupted regular schedules to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Senator of the Arizona Senator, presented a radio so that the FBI could examine the accusations for one week.
Ford told the Elders ’ Board of Justice that she was assured that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to put her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional witness, said that he was assured that it had not happened.
More people likely looked at the trials than the 20,4 million Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company measured the average view of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC television channels.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen is usually in trouble with the measurement of people’s views in offices.
To put this in context, this audience group is similar to the size of football or the Oscar prize feast.
According to Nielsen, most of those who took the whole day were looking at the Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million, who have loyally supported Kavanaugh’s name.
ABC was at the second seat with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was a lot of interest.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Senator of the Republika group released an announcement that he would choose Kavanaugh in favour, the captains CNN and CBS took pictures of when Protestants called him on Friday morning, when he tried to get into the elevator to meet the Judgment Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while raining over him in a direct broadcast at CNN.
One woman said, “I'm standing right in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he's telling the people the truth? ”
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women are powerless. ”
Flake said his office has issued an explanation, and before closing the elevator door, he said he would express himself rather at the committee’s meeting.
The Capal and TV stations had all direct broadcasts later when the Judgment Committee chose whether Kavanaugh’s name should be forwarded to the Elders’ Chair.
Flake said he would only do that if the FBI examined the accusations against the appointed one next week, but a minority of the Democrats has encouraged it.
After part, Flake was convinced by his friend, Chris Coons, a democratic Senator.
After that, Flake made his decision with Coons and some other elders.
Flake’s votes changed because it was evident that the Republicans had not enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized the FBI's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.

Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrical engineer, participated in protests of divorce with his wife and said that he no longer was hopeless that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because of being able to choose, but now we sit fast, ” he said.
Despite the necessity but little victory of regional elections in December last year, independent categories of Catalonia have been difficult to keep a damp this year, since many of their most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in awaiting for trials due to their role in the organisation of the votes and the independent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old engineer who took the protest to support the police, said that both states had encouraged the dispute.
“ The tension grows constantly, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who had been imprisoned and asked for trials since late last year, announced that he would offer himself to the European Congress in the next year.
“In the middle of the European elections, it is the best way to condemn the return in the area of democratic values and oppression that we have seen the Spanish government use,” he said.

Infringement of the 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
First Goal of Dolly Menga guaranteed Livingston victory
Livingston, who came from the lower department, entered Rangers in an open cover, and Steven Gerrard had to suffer his second loss in 18 games as director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the happiness, and Gary Holt's team is now in another seat with Hibernian.
Team Gerrard has not yet worked at an extraordinary department of this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead, on the top, on the next Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the European Department on Thursday.
At the same time Livingston is still invaded in the department with six victories, and Holt chief trainer has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses devices against bitless guests
Laughter Holts should have been over long before it took a target, but their bone loss caused Ranger great trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but heavily hesitated in his attempt to screw, and Alan Lithgow then overshot after running through the defense to receive a scalp shipment from Graig Halkett counter to the target.
The guests left Rangers to play before them in peace, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble in the right places.
And that was how the target was considered important.
Rangers received an extra call, and Livingston worked in creating marketing facilities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga jointly, which received a transmission and scouted from the center of the Vita.
At that stage, Rangers had ruled the ball, but the defense of the residents was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, a target guard had not had much to do.
So this continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had reached to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the targetman of Ranger, and Lithgow shot from the mark after a visit from Livingston.
Askings were constantly encountered in Vitateig Livingston, but were kicked from, and two requirements for a hellshot - after the protection of Halkett against the vice-president Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were rejected.
"Smart" for Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and finality for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood great and continued to overlook all expectations on their way up.
Their style and their teams have hardly changed anything since they came back to the top branch, but Holt has deserved great commendation for having been together since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a superior leader, was very good and led a full-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes all the time.
On the other hand, Ranger lacked inspired.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they had much to do with expectations.
They did not finish their attendances and only once managed to open the half of the home so this should be an awake for Rangers, who is now in the middle of the department.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Köln
It was smiled and bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s visit to Germany, which is designed to improve the relationship between the two nations.
There have been disagreements between them on matters such as human rights, media freedom and access to Turkey to the European Union.
The Erdogan then moved to the Columbia to open new, huge mosques.
The city is the home of most Turkish people outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25.000 people from gathering before the mosque, but a number of supporters were allowed in her neighborhood to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of Kurds — also spoke and condemned both Erdogan’s and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two counterparts reflect the dispute of these guests, who is celebrated as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictatorship ruler of others.

Six prisoners were hurt when infringements broke out in security prison for men, according to an announcement from the Prison Office.
Disturbances broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 9: 30 a.m. at the British local time on Sunday and still steady.
The "Tornado" specialists have been called to the area to try to prevent the disturbances of eight prisoners, and they are only in one yard of prison.

The Vallibyl Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (dry area might benefit)
It is uncommon that the tropical layers are fighting over Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early in the next week when the remainder of the turbulent Rose is over the southwestern part, with a risk of sudden floods.
The weather office of the country has already issued warnings on a sudden flood before Monday and Thursday in the western part of Arizona and the south and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will go straight over Phoenix on Thursday and come late on Monday with a descendant.
The weather office in Phoenix on Twitter said that only “twen turbulents have reached the strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows in shorter than 320 kilometers from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a turbulent within 64 km from Arizona's border."
Last predictions from the country's gallibyl center predict a 5-10 cm outlet, with a unique result up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwestern part, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin (The Great Basin), with the possibility of a unique outcome up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of landing in a sudden flood, Rosa’s descendant may be a blessing because there are great droughts in the area.
Although floods can cause great damage, some of these results will have a positive effect, since dry is now in the southwestern part.
According to the Dry Surveillance of the United States, at least over 40 percent of Arizona is very dry, which is the next highest,” reports from weather.com.
First, Rosa is going to reach a country on the Baja California shaft in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a turbulence on Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels northward at 19 km speed per hour.
The storm crosses the cooler sea in the Pacific, and its power thus declines.
Thus, he is expected to arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday or Monday evening.
There is a great potential in some areas of Mexico, with a considerable risk of flooding.
“The result is expected to be 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of departure,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then keep north of Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach Arizona’s borders early on Thursday as a tropical slope, and then continue through Arizona and come to the southern part of Utah late on Thursday evening.
“ The greatest risk expected from Rosa or her remnant is a very great descendant in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert area of the United States, ” said the country’s county center.
It is expected that these descendants will cause life - threatening floods and land movements in the wilderness, and steps at the end of the mountains.
The attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests due to a murder attempt
Three teenagers and a 20 - year - old man have been suspected of a murder attempt, after a 16 - year - old boy was found with a knife in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured at the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, about 4: 00 a.m. at the British local time on Saturday.
He was moved to a hospital where his condition is said to be “steady. ”
A 17 - year - old boy, two 18 - year - old, and one 20 - year - old man were arrested at night in the district, according to the police from Avon and Somerset.

Trump says that Kavanaugh “was feeling the evil and the anger ” of the Democrat class
“Accord to the support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote rejecting the merciless and absurd methods of the Democrates Group,” said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling in the West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was “found to feel evil and anger ” from the democratic group.
Kavanaugh witnessed the assembly on Thursday, where he hardly denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had punished her sexually a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusations to the Committee.
On Saturday, the president said that “Bundish people had seen the genius and goodness and courage ” of Kavanaugh.
“A vote to confirm the Kavanaugh judge is a vote which confirms one of our best lawyers, a lawyer with a brilliant CV as a official staff,” he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president pointed indirectly into Kavanaugh’s name when he spoke of the importance of the supporters of the Republic.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't offer, but I'm really doing it," he said.
“ That is why I am going all over the world to fight for great offers. ”
Trump argued that the Democrats were working to “beat and stop. ”
The first key statement on the floor of the Elderly Division on Kavanaugh's appointment should be carried out not later than on Friday, according to the assistant of the Chief Officers at the interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died from a earthquake and a wave of floods in Indonesia, and likely the number of the dead will rise.
At least 384 died, and many were washed away when a huge centuries fell on the coasts when a great earthquake and a flood of flood raged over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the coast of Pala on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] of the high centuries at the beach at sunset, washed out a number of people on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The flood was created after a earthquake of 7.5 points in Richter.
“ When the flood - wave threat developed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Emergency Institute, at a information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The river wave did not come alone, it brought cars, trees, houses, she swallowed everything on the ground, ” said Nugroho, adding that the flood wave had traveled over an open sea of 800 miles [800 km] speed before it hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos published by the Emergency Agency showed many devastated buildings and shops, rotated and brows and mosque surrounded waters.
Afterquakes continued to run over the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was seen in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian facility for food and technology, stated that the energy, which was released from the bleeding of the great trembles on Friday, had been about 200 times greater than from the atomic bomb that fell to the city of Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city’s geographical location at the end of a long and soft flood may have increased the size of the flood, said the Institute.
Nugroho said that the damages were “important ” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres, and hotels had crashed.
A number of victims were found to be bound under cracking buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death and property damage could be more than 300 miles [300 km] north of Pala in a area called Donggala, closer to the recording of earthquake.
Communication from Donggala, Nugroho said, “was completely below and no information was obtained. ”
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in announcement, adding that their employees and volunteers are on the way to the relevant areas.
“ This has already become a tragedy, but could be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The foundation was criticized by many on Saturday because they did not tell that a flood wave had scattered Palu, although official representatives said that the centuries had come within the time the warning was published.
In a video published in social media, a man could hear crying from the upper height of buildings to warn the people on the street below about the approach of a flood wave.
Only minutes later, the flooding wave climbs on the coast and carrys out buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood caused no power that prevented Pala’s communication and made it difficult for the authorities to organise helping work.
According to the authorities, the army has started sending aircraft with aids from Jakarta and other cities, but people who have been helped from the area still need food and other needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and will be closed in October.
Joko Widodo, President, is going to visit the refugee center in Pala on Sunday.
The number of dead ones is more than 800 after a flood in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
Workers of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in tent cities set up in the garden outside their offices.
“ People said they've seen many houses ruined, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Auxiliary groups have started hard helping work, but some have complained that abroad relief staff with great expertise would be blocked from traveling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocks and staff may only begin to arrive if the accident area is identified as a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ This is still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
When the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign assistance, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell over Pala after the earthquake and the flooding wave on Friday, friends and their missing families kept in the hope that their loved one of the miraculous stories will be who will bring hope to the devastating predictions of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a launch.
On Sunday, helpers saved a woman who had been stuck under ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian inquiry team, had been the trainer of two missing pilots for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with a long experience in swinging, I have my own emotional burden to wear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news came within the vision group because the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he would have sent WhatsApp a message desperately to the competitors who stayed in Pala and participated in the coastal festival.
His message, however, showed only a grey sign, instead of blue.
“ I think that means that the message was not received, ” he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 dollars at a high-speed bank in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed 26.750 dollars from Brink's employee who was filling a fast bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a news report from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been clearing a fast bank in the entertainment area and was filling more money on it, said Dennis McCarthy, police officer.

Kanye West: The Rapper turns his name into Ye
The rapper Kanye West's gonna change his name - to Ye.
On Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter and wrote: “The world that was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of its eighth album that came out in June.
The change comes for his participation in the Saturday Night Live feature, which is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He places Ariana Grandi in the factory, but she resigned for “sensitive reasons, ” said the manufacturer of the factors.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortening of his current name.
“ I believe that “ye” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means“ you, ” said West earlier in the year when he discussed the name on his record with the Big Boy Radio Manager.
“So I am you, I am with you, this are we.
It went from Kanye, which means the only, and over to just Ye-- to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, all.
The plate is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former co-worker West, has also written his name both with and without braces and braces.
The elected president of Mexico promises not to use the army against general civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised to never use military power against general citizens, now the country will soon be less than 50 years of birthday of bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday, in the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “the army will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers launched peaceful protests on the square and drowned up to 300 people at a time when the left - minded movements of students were shooting roots throughout Romania.
Lopez Obrador has promised to assist young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening more free public university.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational facilities led young people to criminals.
The United States should double the funding for satellite
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of satellite, the United States should double the funds it is in research in this field, says the inventor and the satellite user Kai-Fu Lee who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statements were reported after the various departments of the U.S. Government issued announcements on satellite, even though the United States did not have a formal overall satellite programme.
On the other hand, China reported its plan last year: it refers to being the first place in a new design with a satellite design before 2030.
“ It would be a good beginning to double the funds that are conducted in satellite research, while all other countries are so far longer after the United States, and we are waiting for the next major discovery in the field of satellite, ” said Lee.
Double funding could double the chance of the next large discovery of satellite in the United States,” said Lee to CNBC at an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order”, published this month by the publisher of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is head of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the main satellite companies in China.
He worked with a satellite system in the 1990s at the Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of the former technical competitors held by the U.S. authorities, such as the robot race of the Defense Department, and asked when the next race would be held, to see the next first cells.
In the United States, scientists often have to work hard for the government’s strength, ” said Lee.
“ It’s not China’s who’s the main mind, but the companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technological corporations have advised brilliants from universities to work with satellites over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigrant policy could also help the United States to strengthen their satellite studies.
“ I feel that those who have a doctoral degree in satellite should be allowed to stay automatically, ” he said.
The Chinese Congress issued its future programme in July 2017.
Like the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, the quality of science is worse in China, says Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defense Department launched a satellite centre, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the development of a special committee for satellite design.
And this month DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million each year in satellite studies.
At the same time, the American legislation, which was intended to create a satellite safety advice, has not continued for months.
Inhabitants of Macedonia choose to change the country’s name
Inhabitants of Macedonia chose in a national vote on Sunday whether the name of the country should be changed to the "Amt of Northern Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, named Macedonia, claims that the name of their neighbours in the north is equivalent to their sovereignty, so they refused to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, which was based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the image of the majority of Macedonia’s inhabitants of slave origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote fees and campaigns to ignore it has raised doubts that participants will reach 50 percent of the minimum required to ensure that the vote fee is valid.
The question of the election note is so sounding: “Will you go to Nato and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the name change, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable remuneration for Macedonia to get part of associations such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, many of the Senators have said that they will apply it and bind it in law.
The name change would need to accept two thirds of the assembly.
The council committee said that nothing unusual was not reported at 1 a.m. after noon.
However, the participant was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of participation in the last elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the electors recorded paid their vote.
“ I came to choose because of my children, our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old choosing in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian presidency, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian National Counsel on whether to change the country's name, but it would pay it the way into NATO and the European Union, in Strucica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje, the 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardarkov worked in preparing a small area and setting up chairs in front of tents built by those who will ignore the vote.
"We're down NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the door of service," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a land of poverty, but we have glory.
If they do not approve of us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European relationship."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO will transfer the necessary funding to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“ I believe that the longest majority will agree because more than 80 percent of the people in the country are dependent on the EU and Nato, ” said Zaev after paying their vote.
He said that consent would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A monthly survey published by the Macedonian Political Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of electors would participate in the national budget, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV shows that 57 percent of respondents intend to pay their vote on Sunday.
Of them 70 percent said they were going to say yes.
In order to ensure that the national vote is valid, there must be 50 percent more than one vote.
If the vote is not accepted, it could mean the first serious attack on the policy of the government, which is linked to the Western countries, from its adoption in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, a player of Manchester City, goes through all the defense Brighton and scouts
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he checked his target in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian predecessor received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attendance.
He scattered over three defenses Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Aguero then became surrounded by four green - clothed defense men.
He crossed one defenseman and then ran away from some more just like the Brighton Vitateig.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English prosecutor used the first touch within the vitamin to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play Mathew Ryan, the target Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
“ Aguero is in some footing matters, ” said Pep Guardiola, director of City, to the newspapers.
“ We told him to play 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky that he took a target at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the excellent game.
That mark came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a shipment far inside the field half of Brighton in that attendance.
He sent a beautiful long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling to the distance.
The embarrassing city sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City plays a meeting with Hoffenheim in the Championship Division at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play excavation game against Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing at the end, there was no great reason to force another beginning.
But the enthusiastic Scherzer hopes to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get to the end, but they have the same game forehead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West.
Rockies received at least a "wildcard" seat with their 5-2 victory at Nationals on Friday evening, but the team is still trying to reach their first branch article.
“ Even though we play free, we can at least play for an electrical atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other people are sure to play their best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals will still report who will be the first caster in the game of Sunday, but it is believed that they let Scherzer throw at these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting a game at the 34th time, took a training cycle on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, a normal Sabbath with him.
This right handed caster in Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 windshots in 220 2/3 cycles during this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president pointed indirectly to the case around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, when he spoke of the importance of supporters of the Republic.
“ All are in trouble in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the great, great... I don't offer, but do it, so I go around all the places to fight for great offerers," he said.
Trump continued: “Man sees this terrible, rotary group of democrats, you can see it happen now.
And they are determined to regain power by means of any method, you see the cruelty, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to go to gain power and rule, they just want to have authority and control, we don't give them it.
He said that the Democrats were working on “the rest of the world. ”
“ And it has been seen for the last four days, ” he said, “the Democrats are angry and evil and cruel and unfair. ”
He called the Senatorial Senator Dianne Feinstein, the governor of the Senatorial Committee, by name, and was answered with a loud throne from the audiences.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was that you the last of the document?
Ha, what.
No, no, I waited in one... it was really a bad body suppression, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer a tolerant church.
He does not endure those expressing his mind
When the actors of my group chose to give me an appeal, it was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of many senators of the working group who have been told that we are not welcome, just by expressing our mind.
My member, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she protested hardly against Jewish prejudices.
In my case, it was because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn to give me an appeal.
The substances were important to have a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues, and Jeremy disagreed with the former leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to understand no one outside and be successful. ”
In my eight - year work as Senator of the Workers’ Group, the Friday meetings have been the most often.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone at many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better” policy has been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become more and more evident that different views have not passed in the Workers’ group and that all the views are judged by whether the leaders of the group consider them appropriate.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, who I thought had similar political opinions as I, began to expect that I would take complete reconversion and support the views that I had never previously agreed, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and then I don't care what I say - it follows thorough disgraces in social media, which are called after my withdrawal, central policy disowned, and tells me that I should not be in the Worker's group.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my colleagues, since most of the statements I get to me are usually political.
I am admired of the professionality and confirmation of those who have to endure the holisticness of sexual or prejudiceful offenders every day but never retire.
One of the most disappointed things in this political period is how attacks and injuries have become normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Group should have a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with any distrust or change in choices, the class becomes increasingly thirsty.
I've been given a lot of advice for the last two years, not too high, and then I'll be "alright" with me.
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Worker Group as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government thatcher, who left my school room down, I have struggled for better public service for those who need it most, whether in the city government or at a conference.
I've never hid my political views, nor at the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I agree with the current leaders.
With those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country travels to Brexit, which will harm homes, businesses, and public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Worker Group.
But my only message I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those who are within my coordination, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threats of a derogation or political withdrawal will delay me from doing what I think is for the best of all of you.

Aye 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr’s unoverseated team goes to the top
Two late touch limits could have shaken the final findings something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory divorced in this acute game of the day in the Tentent's Prime Ministerial Department.
They are now at the top seat on the list and one of the ten people who are still unmarried.
Finally, their stronger defense and better use of the tools made homemen more victorious, and Peter Murchie, a trainer, had full right to be happy.
“ We have had severe opposition in our games up to now and are still unmarried, so I have to be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "They deserved praise, they used their chances better than we."
Mark Grant Anderson overcame Ayr in 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the visit, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, which was allowed to play the game with Warriors, enabled Melrose to allow the numbers to speak and Jason Baggot reached the contact point.
Climo increased by the leadership of Ayr with a hell before he checked with a kick right before a semi-game and then touch target and Ayr came over 17-5 in a half-game.
But Melrose began the second half of the game with power and touched Patrick Anderson, after Baggot’s visit, decreased the target to five degrees.
After that, Ayr still increased his leadership with a contact target from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned back.
Blair Macpherson, the leader of Ayr, then received the yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of being over a man with a touch limit from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard visit.
However, homemen came back strongly and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card because of fitting Climo without the ball, MacPherson tested the contact target behind the visit, after an additional spot.
Climo turned the visit, as he did immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe reached the kick of David Amrstrong from the Vitateig and sent to Gregor Henry, who inspected the fifth touch point of the team.
Star Set Game features ready for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game features, seems ready to move to a restaurant shop after the arrival of his director of the restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC features popular, in which he writes and plays with his old companion from the entertainment colleague, Creg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the future nineth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has planned for Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Operation Morn Limited.
The player didn't want to say anything about the news, but a writer Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to participate in the “living restaurants” of Glasgow City.
“Our port is ours: The coastless country of Bolivia hopes that a court will open the way back to the Pacific
The sailors are guarding the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
General construction flags blue flags.
Water stations from the Titicaca water to the Amazon year are marked as the stroke: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
Throughout the 19th - century bloody conflicts, the 19th - century coastal Bolivia reminder of the coastal line losing to Chile is still in a fresh memory - along with the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now when Bolivia is deciding from the International Court of Justice in Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the unified spirit, and the anorexia, and, of course, waits for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diploma.
Many of Bolivia’s inhabitants will observe the international court’s decisions on a large scale throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Haag will decide Bolivia in their interests that Chile is obliged to have access to Bolivia, after decades of difficult conversations.
The decision on Monday is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian families, who will have a controversial fight for re-evaluation in the next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late August.
However, some analysts believe that the Court of Justice would make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and that if he did so, it would make little differences.
The Court of Justice, who has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a country from Sile, and has declared that the decision will not affect the conclusion of possible discussions.
The fact that the court’s decision comes only six months after the final talks shows that the matter “has not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a silent international law expert.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been a matter of Bolivia, but they have caused the country to return.
“ The current government of Bolivia has stolen the matter of access to the sea, ” said Zharate.
The army of Morale's speech has diminished all welfare from Sile, she was counting.
Bolivia and Sile will continue discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after that.
Since 1962, the two countries have not changed to ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “a unique opportunity to open up for a new relationship with Sile” and the opportunity to “end a dispute that reaches 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Romania, was to use this issue as a political increase.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to get back to the past. ”
North Korea says that nothing will be of nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri held his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His statements are coming now, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, seems to be starting again discussions about nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “dromeous ” to keep the continuing trade ties and oppositions of the United States against announcement of the end of the Korean war will ever be kneeling north Korea.
Washington does not want to approve the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes a clear operation to remove its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are great doubts about the seriousness of Pyongyang taking down weapons that the country probably considers as the only way to safeguard its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang for the next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris German shows present the latest line of large headwear that will come into fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not have to look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a lot of spectacular hats in the oversize of their SS19 line in the fashion field that attractively at the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of extremely unhandy hatreds have been published on Instagram in summer, and these designers have shown their newly created works in fashion.
Valentino’s main work was a great light - brown hat with wide burdens similar to the feathers and hiding the motel’s heads.
Of other supersize components, water melons could see jewelry, educated skin, and even ananas, but these items are not designed to keep the head hot.
Thom Browne also introduced many kinds of strange masks, precisely at the right time for the wake.
Many of the colourful masks had merged lips and were similar to Hannibal Lecter rather than to high - German.
One mask looked like a nipple device with a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others looked like blowing ice in bread form.
If you want to pay in the bitch, it's lucky with you.
German experts foretell that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come to the hack of La Bomba, a strain hat with more than 60cm large burdens that have practiced the head from Rihanna to Emily Ratakakowski.
The sign behind the very unhandy hat that was seen in all social media was inspired to another major feature that appeared in the fashion area — a beach bag from the throat that was almost as large as the swimming - clothed motel that weared it.
The Original Straights, with the barbecues and white leather handles, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 fataline Jacquemus on the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion stores for the next summer - where the designer has caused such a great influence should be difficult to ignore demands for supersize companions. ”
John Edward: Language skills Need to World Citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the excellent results of their students, and this has continued in 2018 with new, beautiful tests, which are still strengthened by individual and group results in sports, arts, music and other social practices.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Scoska Private School Council, SCIS) in defense for them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further further study, the career they have chosen, and their position as a world citizen.
As a teacher who can set together and teach for specialized study programs, we see that new things continue to be popular at schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it affects his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just trust in English to build up relations and confidence with people from other countries.
The tests of this year show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who are at stake in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the good rating A.
The data collected from 74 schools in the SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students received the good ratings A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French, and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received the rating A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages that will certainly need the necessary skills for children and young people in the future.
Currently, languages such as selection are placed in the same place as science - related study (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
In 2014, an examination by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that for the reasons that employers stated that jobs were difficult, 17 percent were because of the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future activities.
Now that more and more jobs require skills in languages, this ability is necessary in a world of earthquakes.
No matter what activity people choose, they will have a real priority in the future if they learn another language, but it is a knowledge that ends up in life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a massive person priority to the races.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak a different language enough to maintain conversations, and French was the one language spoken by two letters of percentages, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for modern - day children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multitudes, especially in new marketed countries, will provide children with a better opportunity to find important jobs.
In Scotland, the language they teach varies between schools.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classic new things, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for Britain when viewed up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scotland’s private schools are obliged to offer a study environment that will prepare and prepare children with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future means.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the native business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
Actually, today’s language should be viewed as “international skills in relations. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and superiority for the young people of Scotland.
I want the bees to be fair.
John Edwards is chairman of the Scotland Private School Council
LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait will soon end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Laker’s trainer, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game at Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined in how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Laker’s official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked in his plans for six plays of Laker’s program before the beginning of the season.
“ During this period of my process, I don’t have to play games before the game period to prepare myself, ” he said.
Time for Trump election meeting in West Virginia and YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendships, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote for confirming his choice of the new Supreme Judge has been suspended, Trump aims to build up support for the next mid-term elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the House when votes are paid in November.
What time is the Trump election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia should begin at 19 a.m. on Eastern Time tonight, Saturday 29 September, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, where tensions existed due to the accusations of sexual assault.
But the main goals of Trump’s meetings are to help the Republicans get better steps, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
Thus, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aimed to “fill volunteers and supporters enthusiasm when the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority of them in the elderly department and at the congress,” according to Reuters news office.
“The government of the House is so necessary for the president’s plan that he will travel to as many states as it is possible now when the alternative campaign period begins,” said an unnamed speaker of Trump’s election campaign at Reuters news office.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and it is expected that supporters come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh tell him,” according to West Virginia Metro News news.
The Saturday meeting will be another visit of Trump to the West Virginia this month, but he won over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the representative of the Republics of West Virginia, to the elderly department, but he's at the bottom of the surveys.
“ It is not good for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s newsroom.
Ryder The Cup 2018: The United States shows willingness to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three single - sided rings, the fourth, which was afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what needed in this race about the Ryder cup.
Success is a sport that has been discovered and in which the players truly believe, and never more than in the races like this.
Where would they say that success is now low?
“They had six steps in front, and now it is four points, so the success is rather on our side now, I expect,” said Jordan Spieth when he started in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has the front, four steps ahead, with twelve additional steps.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe that they have some wind in the seals, and they can be hopeful over many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each of them received three levels of four.
Spieth has played a great deal of distinguishing to flat and guided by his example.
After he and Thomas had been two stages below two games, the crystals increased, and he put down an important put to shepherd all the four stages of the game.
His put, which guaranteed them the victory in the 15th hole, received similar joy cry of the kind that tells you that he believes that the U.S. team has still a victory hope.
“ You just have to blow deep and think about your own game, ” said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players can now.
18 holes to win in a score.
One of the players with more scores than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable history of Ryder.
This weird, but fascinating European couple has won four games of four and can’t do anything wrong.
“ Moliwood ” was the only couple who received a school afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid schools on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday, and at the nine holes on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flood both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couples that have to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun is sitting over the Le Golf National.
The best option would be to both do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swiss buried into a hole that they never got to crack up.
But on Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and four games are so exciting to look closely because of the interactions between the couples, their advice, the counsel they don’t give, and how the play plan can change into a single problem.
Europe has played better so far and has a considerable priority before the end of the day, but this four - century slot also showed that the American team has the willingness of fighting that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leadership before the last day of the race about the Ryder cup
Europe will have a good precedent for the end of the day of the Ryder cup after the four-cut and four-folds of Saturday, with a priority of 10-6 to the United States.
The Starbuilding Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, which had difficulties, and have received four points in the Le Golf National Field.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn, who would like to recover the price cup, which it lost in the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the United States team in the morning’s four - ball game and won 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition during the fourth century and won two games but did not get to work up the score difference.
LADY Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European new team who works four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood ” after a marvelous weekend, are only the second couple who wins four points from their first four games in Ryder’s history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-column game, they showed a great team and won the downside of Woods and the American new team Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliant intelligence several times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was awaited for the four-column game of the morning, came back to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the four-games, and they worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are in the first and third seat of the list of best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not take all the advantage of this mild and ghosty day southwest of Paris.
A threefold victory in the golf race, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas, set the goal for Americans with two stages on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-colour games and later came back and victory Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four-games after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the Ryder cup’s history has occurred that a team has worked up four stages will at the beginning of a individual race, although Furyk’s team would only have to be equal to continue the cup.
However, after the next two days, they seem to be overwhelmed.
Northern Korea says unilateral disarmament "inappropriate" without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told SD that the continuing trade bonds were only dependent on their lack of confidence in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to remove its nuclear weapons solely under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho at the Annual General Assembly of S.D. said that North Korea had taken “a large number of actions to show pleasant willingness” in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and ventilator tests, degrading the nuclear testing area, and promiseing to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ However, we have not seen any corresponding reactions from the United States, ” he said.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certain nature of our country’s security, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons alone first. ”
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about the opposition of Washington to the "graduate" approach to nuclear weapons where North Korea would be rewarded for every step that it took, his declaration seemed special in the way that he did not deny nuclear weapons purely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint declarations of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim promised to work on the 'core nuclear weapons' and Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a solution to make a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax the strict ban on business against North Korea.
“The United States demands that ‘ nuclear weapons are first in place’ and increase pressure by using business bonds to achieve their own, even protesting the declaration of ending the war, ” said Ri.
“ There are only dreams of people who don’t know anything about us to think that business ties can make us knees.
But the problem is to continue business relations increase our lack of confidence."
Ri mentioned nothing about the plans of another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the leader of the United States spoke about at the SD earlier this week.
Instead of talking about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea for the last five months, he added: “If the party said that this nuclear weapon was South Korea instead of the United States, it would not be this state of nuclear weapons.”
Despite this, the tone in Ri was very different from his talk last time when he said at the General Assembly that it would be inevitable to direct missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after the "Devil President" Trump called Kim "fighter" in a suicide campaign.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destruct ” North Korea, but in this year he proclaimed Kim to the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still a lot of work left and that business bonds would have to continue until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable in this regard, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Security Council S.D. should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On Thursday, however, Mike Pompeo, foreign minister of the United States, at the Security Council of the United States, said: “The Security Council’s interconnections must continue to apply until complete nuclear weapons have taken place and it has confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase business relations with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close the funding for Pyongyang nuclear and aeroplane planes.
Pompeo met Ri at the sideline of the SD General Meeting, and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again for the next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “critical requirements. ”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that if the United States had taken into “core operations, ” the United States would take down a fireplace area and a nuclear station.
He said that Kim had said that the “corresponding actions ” he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and operations towards normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard Are Suspending Study
A new study at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the best university in the world often know little or nothing about the basic principles of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor in sleeping medicines at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believed that it saw the first species in the United States.
He was given the idea of conducting a study after reading the impact of sleep shortages on the needy.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why is this told me first now, in my final year? ”
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
The first study this year explains to students the basic elements of how good sleeping practices help to athlete and performance and even contribute to general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School and Head of Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce a study after finding that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour of length and includes various interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of the home room, where students click on coffee, window tents, sportshoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can worsen with the lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good routine before sleeping.
In other parts, the lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that favors those who are watching and learning all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure on students meant a growing shortage of sleep.
Assurance of sleeping of good quality should be a “secret weapon” of students to protect stress, tiredness, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fatting, because the lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped professor Czeisler to put together the course, but he sat one of the professor’s cows in the first year of Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all the students at school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all masters to finish a similar course before they start a college study.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting a wake clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to raise them, and consider the harmful effects from blue light that electrical screens and LED light give away, but it can confuse the inner clock of the body and cause trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had problems in the outermost, because Stevens Gerrard's division had to accept 1-0 losses of Livingston, after target from Dolly Menga.
Team Ibrox wanted to achieve his first victory at the end of his victory at St Johnstone in February, but team Gary Holt gave Gerrard's only his second loss in his 18 games as director. The team is now eight points after Hearts, which is at the top seat of the Ladbrokes Premiership Department.
The pollution tested seven minutes before half the game, and the team of Rangers seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to balance.
Rangers are now falling into the sixth seat, but Livingston goes up to the third and is only after Hibernian in the target range.
Rangers could suffer further difficulties after the liner Calum Spence had to have a head injury after some thing was thrown into him from the half of the guests’ field.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that wasted Ayr away and came to the final end of the Betfred cup.
However, Holt remained at the same Living 11 set that reached a step of Heart last week, and he would have been pleased with how well trained his servants overwhelmed the opposition.
Rangers may have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should have checked only two minutes after the toy when the first sending from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors, but he shot over.
A long leap from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense company, shot over the distance.
Rangers recovered the game, but seemed to live in hope rather than believing in his game in the final third part of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have had a hell when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Columbian's call.
Rangers could only take two shots in the first half of the game, but Liam Kelly, former marker Ibrox, had no need to have much for protecting the shells from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Even though the opportunity from Livi in a 34 - minute minute period had come, no one could deny that they deserve it, but not just because of their endurance.
Rangers failed to do something again from Jacob's long supplement.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and elected to send to Menga, which then easily checked.
Gerrard took his half-game advice and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly, and the shifts had effect near the time the back guard entered Morelos, but Kelly quickly reacted and ran forward to close the shot.
But Livingston continued to narrow the guests to play just the game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett got each long transmission on the feet of another.
Laughter Holts could have increased his leadership at the finals, but McGregor was well able to deny Jacobs of the opportunity before Lithgow ran to the point of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the guardian of Ranger, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell together, but Thomson rejected it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a magazine page from our general “Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and FRAM... this is the day that future theologist John Wilhelm “Hans ” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger measurement.
Since then, the Geiger measurement has been established in the science world, but was also popular in the pop population, for example, in the 1950 Bells of Coronado movie, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in different roles as scientists:
“ What the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s measurement, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put this hearing tool on you, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It really breaks now! ”
“ His ” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63 - year birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine may cause the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine may instruct the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of treatment
Treatment includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can “seen” proteins that are common in many cancer cells and are then injected back into the patient
Study vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, the vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method includes taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “seen” proteins called HER2 and are found in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “We find our results suggest that the vaccine is very successful. ”
HER2 “Let some cancers stop growing, ” including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs, and pulmonary disorders,” said Professor Berzofsky.
Similar methods of removal of immune cells from patients and the “training” of cancer cells have been activated during the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long consensus to support Trump and wore MAGA therehuva after appearing in the SNL television show.
It did not end well
On Kanye West, in the Studio in Saturday Night Live, a long - term talk was built, commended by President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he would invite himself to the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore Make America Great Derhufa, he spoke long against democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“ I have spoken so often to white people who say, “How do you like Trump, he is a race hater? ”
If I was worried about racial hatred, I would have been moved from the United States for a long time, ” he said.
SNL began the part with a panel where the Hollywood Star Matt Damon made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Elders’ Committee on the accusations Christine Blasey Ford of sexual extortion.
Though the long end of West was not sent out, the recording of it was placed on a social media of the funny Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make a joke to the West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audiences that he had received bad receptions because of his choosing.
“ I was placed in a challenging back.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the scene with this house. ”
They screwed me!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Would you want to see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero’s wall,“ because that means you can’t order me to do things, do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
His comments were received by a watchman at least two times, and, according to Variety, the SNL’s actors seemed shameful, and one attendant said to the newspaper: “There became stone silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to take the part instead of the singer Ariöna Grande, but her boyfriend, the rape Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many of them with his performance when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, chairman of TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the most courageous souls: TAKE TO BE MANAGEMENTS. ”
But on Twitter, the chat star Karen Hunter said that West was simply “he himself, and it’s quite wonderful. ”
“But I chose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”) that I feel supporting and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapist on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that now he was “the being who was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapist, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the Prince’s vows of music, who turned his name into a symbol and later called himself the artist known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the Star of the Queen Games, criticizes poisonous maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures of the HBO, the Queen Games.
The 31 - year - old player, however, has criticized the status of the male hero and says that such a role on screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be hard to gain respect.
In a interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that “something has gone wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisonous male in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his companion from the Queen Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, acknowledged that he had “stark views ” on how to deal with this matter.
“Personally, I feel at the moment - what has been wrong with maleness? ”
“ What have we taught men in their growing up, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increased poisonous maleness, because of a very male person on television.
He continued: “What is congenital, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on streets that make young boys feel like they must be made by a man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of the contemporary -- how do we change this?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also acknowledged at the interview that he would not play in any other Crown games after the following summer, saying that he had received “a lot of warfields and horses. ”
From November, Kit will play in the reconstruction of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film manufacturer and his brother who is a robber.
The player recently said that the best thing to have played in the Queen Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these aspects, so that they gave me somehow my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's loved woman, who Kit played in this Emmy Prize Event.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/infection: China reports 14% increase in renal infection
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of nationals infected by the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 8200,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A large majority of new infectures struck with sex, which is a change from the previous.
In the past, HIV was rapidly spread into some of China’s parts because of the administration of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of those infected by the HIV virus has fallen into almost zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a Yunnan district conference.
However, the number of infected patients with HIV or AIDS has increased about 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infected by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a great difference between LGBT people.
Due to the country’s sustainable values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men are eventually married to a woman.
Many are being infected because of inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of the plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from the Senatorial Assembly of the Republic, criticizing “hazardous lies” and “conspiratory teachings”
On Saturday, the Senator Maxine Waters denied the accusation that one of her employees had published personal information to the three Senatorial Assembly of the Republican Group on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said that these claims came from “super-righteous ” extremists and websites.
“ Liars, liars, and more disgusting liars, ” said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The information published contained, according to the addresses and phone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown member of Capitol Hill while interrogations were held at Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, as a result of the accusations of sexual offenses.
The game came once after the three Senatorial Assembly had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Containing pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IPs that identify the author of the information have been linked to the Waters office and published information about one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“ This unreasonable accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My employee — whose personal information and security are now in danger because of these wrong accusations — is not in any way responsible for this information sales.
This unrestrained accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former reporter of the White House.
"This denial is full of anger," wrote Fleischer.
“ That indicates that she has no ability to sit at a congress.
When a person is accused of reasonlessness, he must not be angry.
We cannot show opposition.
It must not be questioned for the reasons of the accusation.
It must show peace and contempt."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of the Kavanaugh judge, who critics said that it seemed too angry with the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the offering republics against Waters in the mid - era, also said his view on Twitter.
“ If it is true, ” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had let “the competent authorities and lawyers know of these untrue claims.
“ We will make sure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be charged for all the harmful and dangerous things that are done to all my employees. ”
Movie criticism for Johnny English Strikes again - Scenic image with Rowan Atkinson proves small
It is now used to look for the Brexit references in all new pictures where Britain comes to history, and this seems to be true in this reliving of the Johnny English laugh series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English film and just awakened to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this canyon satir of how disgusting we are a new export device for the country?
Whether it is or not, the extinct, greedy, and clothing Johnny English has received renewed permission to devour everything - his name shows above all that he is designed for a show in other than English - speaking countries.
Of course, he is the wise Secret Serviceman who seems to be living with fascinating personalities but is a little mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire at the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious world citizen who Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he distinguished himself.
There's one or two good things in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking into a helicopter dressed with a medieval bulb, and the helicopters were scattered into his helmet.
Atkinson evidently shows his funny ability, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now when “severe” movies such as James Bond and Mission Imposable pictures are also offering a joke.
The laugh seems to be more intended for children than for adults and I felt the adventures that Johnny English had not been as ideological and focused as the silent jokes of Atkinson in Mr. Beans.
The everlasting concept of the picture is now that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into Britain's secret spy network and get out of the identity of all British scientists, for a great deal of amazement for the inspector who is on the guard, but there, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon is in a small role.
This is the final struggle for the Prime Minister, who is proud and disputed by a person, and already in a great disturbance due to enormous political enemy: Emma Thompson does its best with its role as a person to remind Theresu May, but the manuscript is not a lot of fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active scientists are in danger and that she must find someone who had been sitting in a holy stone.
And there Johnny English himself comes to the story, now head of school in some fine school, but also gives secret instruction on how to be a scientist: here are some funny jokes offering English to the scientist school, which reminds us of the picture School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and there meets Bough, his former long - tired partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in the energetic role of Vicki Pepperdine does not completely let her light shine.
The spider that cracks everything in her Majesty’s service has now come back to the pond and meets the shocked Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is riding by the magic of the fantastic billionaires within the technology industry, which claims to be able to resolve from British computer problems: that's the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their shaking trips: they turn on in fine French restaurant secrets as servants, they cause disturbances when they smuggle themselves in Volta's luxury snake, and English turns everything around when he tries to use the visual glasses to explore the interior of the Volta house.
There is nothing to save in this final, but even though the picture is frightening and energyful, there is some childhood in it as a whole.
A medium-sized substance.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't think but, can British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his ability?
The working group refuses to make a four - day workweek plan for Britain with the same wages as five days ago.
The working group, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, now considers a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, supervisors want to make use of the savings made from the revolution to satellite, and to benefit employees by receiving one extra holiday.
At that time, employees could enjoy three days of weekends without lowering their wages.
Sources say that the idea would "pass" to the group's economic plan and its policy of improving jobs' interests.
The Trade Union Congress Organisation has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, which led workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A author of the Upper Worker Society said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be reported before the end of the year.
“The change will not take place in one night, but four days of working week is a goal that suits the approach of the group to change the economy to the workforce and to the total industrial policy of the group.”
The group of workers would not be the first to support this idea, but the Green Group promised four days of work in its election campaign in 2017.
The goal, however, is not supported by the Workers’ Group as a whole.
A spokesman of the Working Party said: “Four days of working weeks are not on the class’s newspaper, and the group is not considering to introduce it. ”
John McDonnell, Business Minister of the Shadow Ministry, used the Labour Group's conference last week to describe its ideas of social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was decisive to regain power from "unknown leaders" and "collectives" providers.
The shadow minister's estimates also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get all of their parts back, since the Government of the Working Party could impose a “prosperity” on the grounds of mean infringements.
He has also confirmed the plans to put workforces into the Management Committees of Enterprises and to create a shared ownership treasury in order to allow 10 percent of the own resources of private companies to their employees, which could receive 500 pounds of them annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI study of Kavanaugh could make them change their opinion.
Investigation by the FBI on the charges against the Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a weekly delay in the final vote on his name to the Supreme Judge, and raises the question whether her findings might cause the Senatorial Senators of the Republic to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the section “60 minutes ” of the republics and the Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that led them to change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
“ I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the accusations were made, I called him and asked, “Do you do this? ”
He was determined, stable, unambiguous."
However, Graham’s vote seems unchangeable.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be an incredible accusation to change it, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I know: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she named could not confirm it.
This is 36 years old.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the international civil festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York, a yearly musical event in which a series of great stars will occur and with similar influences; the end of poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Citizen Festival, and tens of thousands of people will flourish to Central Park, not only to listen to musical issues from including Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to bring an end to sorrow poverty before 2030.
The first international Civil Festival, held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project (Global Poverty Project), an international fighting organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of fighters.
To get a free record of the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP notes), music guests had to complete various tasks, or “activities”, such as working voluntary work, sending e-mails to any of the world's leaders, calling calling or using other valid ways to help bring attention to their goal of bringing an end to poverty.
But how much has the celebration achieved, now in 12 years, to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of praising people with free music really a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so - called “small operation” - because people think they do something that matters by signing a list of requirements on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “operations ” from its supporters, in order to call for many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped the world’s leaders to declare obligations and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect more than 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group summed up 390 commitments and notifications due to its operations, of which at least 10 billion dollars have been invested or collected.
The group estimates that to date the funding has affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main obligations comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and managers in Britain, who is working to “help children to enjoy their own fullness,” and promised to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help bind the end of malnutrition in the country after having received 4700 messages from the Global Citizens to Twitter.
“With the support of the British Government, empowerers, governments worldwide and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustices of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition, to the audiences of the London musicians in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent to Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach up to 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of common questions on the website of the group, one question sounds like, “Why do you think you can put an end to sore poverty? ”
Global Citizen answered: “There will be a long and difficult task - sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will reach our limits, just as movements fought for the rights of civilians and the elimination of race separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among those present in this year are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York and the presentations are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the marine army as a “contrary” to prevent Russia’s energy exports, says the Minister of the Interior
“ If necessary, ” Washington could use the maritime army to prevent energy from reaching the market in Russia, including in the Middle East, ” says Ryan Zinke, United States Interior Minister, according to a report from Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works in the form of the legitimate government there, would be a proposal to explore new markets.
“I think the reason for their beings in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy such as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he should have said.
And, according to public notice, there are ways and methods to counteract it.
“ The United States can use the maritime army to ensure that seaways are open and to create obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them is not marketed, ” he said.
Zinke addressed a meeting offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of the energy emission dance ” in the United States.
He continued and gathered Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“ The Irish and Russian elections are increasingly less and less useful for energy donations and to replace them with others, ” he said Russia has only one card in the memory of economics dependent on petrol.
The statements result from the fact that Trump's governance wants to increase its export to Europe of gas and instead of Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump itself, have tried to force Germany to stop participating in the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 tasks of deploying a new energy channel, which Trump says would "catch" Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of North Stream 2 energy management, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion meters of diameter, is an economic project only.
Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply ongoing for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“ I believe that energy should not be a tool to use pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the belts, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticised by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industrial Association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to not interfere with the EU's energy policy and the two-side agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very uncomfortable with the foreign governments of our energy team,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “two serious” to offer itself to the Presidential Office in 2020, says she.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusett’s Senator, said on Saturday that she would “considere seriously ” to offer herself to the president after the mid - century elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader, ” said a report from The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider offering myself to the President’s office. ”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “going with the country in the wrong direction.
“ I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been uncomfortable with his criticism on Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Judge.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said, “Of course, we must have the FBI to examine the matter before the vote fees. ”
However, a Thursday survey shows that the majority of electors in the Warren County do not think that it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable” choosers in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not offer himself, according to a survey published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said they supported her offer.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor Deval Patrick, who said that 38 percent supported his possible offer and 48 percent said that they were opposed to it.
Among other popular democrats who were discussed for a possible presidential procurement in 2020 were Joe Biden, former vice-president, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of the Senatorial Mission from Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, as reported by Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the disturbance of Track Palin at Donald Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, a 26 - year - old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening
“ My son is going through great difficulties after returning, I feel with other families who experience the effects of disturbance and the spiritual pains with which our soldiers return home, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the file in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ came back only differently, they are hardened, wondering whether any respect is given to what their army and air force companions and other army departments have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent announcement of domestic violence and arms under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police officer in Wasilla.
18 Countys and Washington D.C. supporting challenges against a new refugee leadership policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against the new policy of the United States that denies victims flying prosecution or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city sent a trial report on Friday in Washington to support a refugee seeker who objected to the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions Advocate of the American Civil Liberties Union has not been given up.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons who were adjacent members, ” used her to be violenceful, but American government workers rejected her application for refuge on July 20th.
She was put in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems associated with walking and domestic violence are increasingly growing.
The new refugee policy revokes the decision of the Appellant Committee of Migrants in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fled home violence to seek refuge.
On Friday, Mr. Racine, state prosecutor Washington said that the new policy “was ignored for decades of government and international laws. ”
“The federal law requires a decision to make all access requests based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and these policies are in breach of this rule,” said the trial report.
In the report, lawyers also stated that the policy that denied immigrants on entry was harmful to the American economy, and argued that immigrants were more likely to set up businesses and “know important work. ”
Jeff Sessions, a prosecutor of the State, ordered judges in immigrant matters to stop refugeing victims who escaped domestic violence and prosecution in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on races, religions, nationality, or membership of a certain social group or political opinion may seek refuge, ” said Sessions in their announcement on June 11.
It was never intended for refugees to solve all the problems, even not all serious problems that people were dealing with every day worldwide.
Hopeful rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Pala, the number of the dead is doubled
Conditions will be increasingly difficult for those who survived.
“ There is a great excitement in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son in the center of help in the city of Pala.
“ Hospital cars bring the bodies here all the time.
There's little of pure water."
Inhabitants saw returning to their devastated homes and searching for their water sauces to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were hurt, and hospitals are overwhelmed and damaged after the earthquake measured at 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and shoulder, were outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were plucked outdoor because of continued powerful postquake.
His tears filled his eyes, when he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth height, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pressed up to the wallasts, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to marry.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Sender blames China for "People" with "Agricultural Advertisements"
A week after an official newspaper in China published four later advertising in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual advantages in trade between the two countries, the United States ambassadors in China accused of using American media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, talked last Wednesday about the Chinese magazine’s advertising in the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China to try to interfere with the United States Congress elections that will be on November 6th.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere with U.S. congress elections marked what official American representatives said Reuter’s news office was a new step in the growing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising to promote business, Beijing and Washington have a hard business war, with new customs duties on import goods in both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that Chinese revenge dollars were designed early in the business war to harm emigrators such as Iowa, who supported the reputation group of Trumps.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, whereas a large number of agricultural goods are exported to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and companies.
Branstad, in his report in the Sunday Journal of Des Moines Register, said that “China was now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is using the dear language freedom of the United States and our free media by publishing a costly advertising in the Des Moines Register magazine, ” said Branstad in its article.
“ On the other hand, there are few protest voices in press stores in the streets of Beijing, and there is no real reflection on the different views that Chinese might have on the anxiety of China’s economic policy, since media are stuck under the Chinese Communist class’s hills, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China escaped the invitation to publish ” his article, but he did not explain what paper it was.
Experts warn that the Republicans are making female choosers consider them for the mid-term evaluations with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, during the next mid - era, because many Republicans have supported and protected Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, who has satisfied the accusations of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings about this matter, and most of the Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start a vote.
“ These things cannot be backed, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School Institute at the Syracuse University, at The Hill for a article published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that in the last minute of the FBI’s investigation, Jeff Flake, the Senator of the Senatorial Republic of Arizona, was calling to rob the evil choosers.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow and not November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, director and speaker for the Freely MoveOn group, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants sang “November approached! ” when they protested at the elders’s walks when the Republicans who led the decision committee decided to continue Kavanaugh’s name, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ An enthusiastic and enthusiastic chooser will rise out of all power, ” said Stu Rothenberg, independently of the politics, at the news page.
“ People will say that the interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he may be greater, especially with female choosers in the outskirts, and younger choosers, 18-29 years old, who like the president, than rarely choose."
The reporters foretold a relapse if the Republicans pressed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, where she declared her accusations of sexual extortion from him.
“ This has become a huge cloth for the Republican group, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican Group Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The matter is not only about the votes of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is taken on the class, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it, ” said Guy Cecil, President of the United States Priorities, a group assisting in choosing the Democrats, at the news station.
However, the United States seems to disagree with who should believe in a witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority of them support the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents surely or probably believed the Ford witness, while 35 percent said that Kavanaugh’s witness was sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or surely lying in their witnesses, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the flake call, the FBI is now investigating the accusations that Ford made and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to Guardian news.
Ford witnessed the oath before the decision committee of the elderly branch last week and said that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez reports that Kavanaugh was beating his gender before her when they were both at a celebration as a student at Yale University in the 1990 ’ s.

Tim Berners-Lee, the man who found up the network, is going to set up a sprota company to fight against Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last mission of the technology Gospel, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open site Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the intention behind Inrupt was “the superiority of the world. ”
"We have to do this now," he said about the sprota company.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “private online data store” or POD.
There can be a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and work-related devices.
It looks like that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is completely under the user who can get access to any information.
The company calls it “Personal power loss by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, the head of the company, the idea is that Inrupt is that the company grants access, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security job purchased by IBM, several programmers who were appointed as a worker to work in the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
Since this week, technology developers worldwide could create their own independent programs with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that would put their current business model on their head in one night.
“ We don’t ask for permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in a article published on Saturday at Media that Inrupt was “to create energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid. ”
Berners-Lee converted the network in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the discussion of the network's neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes up Inrupt.
“ I am full of optimism for the next period of the network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest and handmaster of Viktoria Crusher from World War I Honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Crucifix during the first world war, a soldier who has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, Mr. Bernard Vann, who served as chief of the army, received the cross in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, a secret shooter killed him four days later, and he was never told that he had received the highest glory of the British army.
Two of his grandsons revealed memories about him during a spawning walk in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderful figurative ” that the memorial was revealed exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s honor.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lord Vann led his army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin circuit “through a very thick thickness and under a severe shooting attack from guns and machine guns. ”
Later, he ran to the shooting line, and with “much courage ” he brought the line forward before he attacked the parachute of his army and overwhelmed three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war, the chief victory was killed by a German secret shooter.
Michael Vann, a 72 - year - old, said that his grandfather’s heroic deeds were “some thing I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the flower after the spinning, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great privilege of participating in the cruise, ” adding that“ the deeds of true heroes are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead of seeing Gurru pigs
Just imagine, having woke up all night to see an overfilled Bellator 206, just to be refused to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main record, and they were displayed in direct broadcasting all night in Britain on the Channel 5 Channel.
At 6: 00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for fighting, British observers received an unexpected event when the broadcast changed to Gurru grise.
Some were dissatisfied after watching the battle all night.
One fan of Twitter described the change to the child’s subject as “a kind of sick joke. ”
“ According to official rules, the material was not qualified to the watchers at 6:00 a.m. so they had to switch into childhood matter,” said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Gurra pigs, yes."
Scott Coker, director Bellator, said they would go through their schedules and take the viewers in Britain into account in the future.
“ I think when I think about the reconciliation that we could probably get rid of this, ” said Coker.
“ But at six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we cannot resolve this until Sunday of our day, which is Monday for them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when shipping was changed, a number of text messages were sent forward and back, and they were not all kind.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We limit the evening to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out of our way.
This is an unhappy state."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inadequate" because of sex
The olympian deaf man Tom Daley said that he had felt inadequate with other people in his breeding because of his sexuality, but that it encouraged him to achieve success.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others ” before he went to high school. ”
In the Radio 4 Radio Desert Island Discs, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said that he spoke of the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that his parent’s role reduced his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the ordinary coordinator, has taken a few months of vacation because of illness.
Daley, first part of Lavernne, said that he felt he was “lesser than a man, ” but all others when he was a child, because“ it was not agreed in the community to love both boys and girls. ”
He said: “As far as today, these feelings of being inferior have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so he would not cause any disappointment when he finally came up with his sexuality.
The twofold Olympian Bronze has been prompted as a supporter of LGBT, using its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he was being told, because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment, and he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world champion said three times that it “have surprised him ” to be in love with a man - American filmman Dustin Lance Black, who first met him in 2013.
Daley married the 20 - year - old occupational occupational occupational occupation.
"When a man walks through so much in his young age" - but he took part in his first Olympics for 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find the same aged who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley, saying that his “all his way of life ” had been curbed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning a gold prize," he said.
“ You know, there are more important things than the gold prize of the Olympics.
Robbie is my olympia gold prize."
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged 40, after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said that his father hadn't accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“ I couldn’t say to him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the first row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally acknowledged that he wasn’t victorious, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“ I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to deepen myself in front of the audience at the Olympics, ” he said.
It was also inspired to the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - who had given him inspired for the Olympics and yet gave him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a British time.
Mickelson in a bad shape and a dead place on the class in Ryder's cup on Saturday
The U.S. Phil Mickelson will be able to make an estimate on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder cup, but he needs to find his old taches again so that it is not estimated to be surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the 12th time of the match, was awarded in the class after the decision of manager Jim Furyk for the four - ball races and four games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hazard, as he has been so many times before the United States, the day of the five - fold master is divided between being a clay manager and practising the toys on the field in the hope of correcting what he amars.
Mickelson, a 48 - year - old, was never the one who shot with the killers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where long glosses often punish for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf area is a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the victory of British Open, in the nineth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new team Tommy Fleetwood and together have won all its four games this week.
If the Americans, which are four points below when they take the first game of 12 enthusiastic games, reach a good start, the play of Mickelson could divide.
Furyk declared his trust in his husband, but he could hardly say much more.
“ He perfectly understood the role he had today, clapped my back, and took me out and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has a lot of self - confidence.
He is in the famous palace, and he has been so great rewards for the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I realized more, but so this ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will strike Nick Faldo in a number of games played in Ryder's cup on Sunday.
This might market the end of the process in the Ryder cup that has never achieved quite as high as other results on his file.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and 7 equals, but Furyk said that his presence had a distinct effect on the team.
“ He's funny, he's athletic, he likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the team room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of Europe, knows that a lot of priorities can disappear soon
The European leader Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a good front for the last day of the Ryder cup of individuals can easily turn into uncomfortable experience.
In 1997, Danin first played in Valderrama, where, along with the leader Seve Ballesteros, had five steps ahead of the Americans, but was right to win at the end with a minimum score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“Man recalls that we had a lot of priority in Valderrama, we had a lot of priority in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but only rightly,” said Björn, which was shown here on the picture, after watching the 2018 yeargang, working 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and reaching the preliminary 10-6 on the Le Golf National Velline.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't done.
We'll all work out tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not finished until all the points are on the tablet.
We have our goals, and it's trying to work this cup, we're focusing on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very conscious of our opponents in the other team - the best golfers in the world."
Bjørn was very pleased with how his players were standing in a difficult field, adding: “I’m never going out of myself in this.
The morning will be different.
Tomorrow, the view of individuals is important, and it is another thing.
It's great to play with a companion when everything's going well, but when you play one one is tried on all man's ability as a golfer.
It is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to reach the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now a man leaves his partner and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bear, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek to make his players stand better in individual games rather than with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who worked three levels of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big change on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline, but ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle of Medinah. ”
“ I remember every fucking word, ” he answered, asking how Ben Crenshaw, in 1999, had encouraged his players for the last day.
“ We have to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When the struggle reaches up, it causes great pressure on the game in the middle.
We ordered our players accordingly and let them play as we think we'll go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to defend and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the plays.
“I chose these players in this order because I think they were all the way through, ” said Bjørn about their choice of players in the individual race.
The New Ship of Germany is still postponed
The latest ships of the German marine should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be prepared until first of all in the next year due to broken systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
Based on "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leadershipship of the Gweny Warship of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of the year 2019, according to the authors of the army speaking to Die Zeit.
The ship had to be helped by the marine army in 2014, but serious problems after the disposal, the project was resolved.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Marine in 2007 should replace the ships of the Bremen group, which have come to their years.
They should be prepared for a powerful parachute, a number of air-protection and ship-planes and hiding techniques such as reduced radar infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer use time - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these newest types of ships - which are said Germans are able to show their strength on the sea - will become when they are finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 ship arrived in the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the fleet and returned it to the Blohm & Voss Drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the marine has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons behind the defence, but the German media spoke of many women who were seriously “defected in software and machinery” that made the ship useless if they were sent to a campaign.
Software gaps were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg army will be controlled by 120 people of crew, which is half less than the ships of Bremen.
It also revealed that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the marine to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000 tons of “Rheinland-Pfalz ” ship is considered to be twice thirstyer than a ship in a similar class that the Germans used during World War II.
In addition to the defects of machinery, the cost of all the project - including the training of the crew - has started to cause problems.
It is reported to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but it was originally to be 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest ships are particularly important in the light of the warning that the superiority of the Germans on the sea is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Congress’s Defense Committee, acknowledged that the sea army was actually to be “reached with a efficient ship. ”
The deputy said that the problem had arisen in time, for older ships were taken out of use but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the orders of Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be taken into use by the marine army.
National Protection Society spys on a secret life of leather leather
A new study conducted in the soils of the Scottish highlands aims to find out how leathers use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will throw a new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future natural protection operations.
The research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor various species of leather leather in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be set up on key locations in the area to monitor the behavior of the leather leathers over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also be monitored with handheld senses.
Experts will identify all recordings to find the frequency of calls that the leathers give out and what types do what.
Maps of housing and reporting will then be published in order to create a precise picture of their geographical behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS’ NTS’s NTS’s NSA, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of living area is most important for the leather leathers and how they are used of each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the management of habitats, e.g. by creating noise and the best way to maintain forest lands for leather and other related species.
In the last century, leaflets have fallen considerably in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce their lives.
Windmills and lights can also pose risks, including flight papers, and certain relief handles on building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Leaflets are not really blind.
However, their ears benefit them much better than their eyes when fishing aids, because they are used to hunt in the night.
They used high - depth ceiling techniques to find insects and items on their flight.
The NTS, responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of the country around the country, takes leather leather leather very seriously.
In the organizations, ten experts carry out regular checks, terrestrial reviews, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and one leather land of Scotland at the Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten leather species of Scotland have their homes.
David Thompson, overseer of the farm, says he is a perfect area for them.
“ The area here at Threave is great for leathers, ” he said.
“ We have old buildings, enough of growing trees, and a full of good dwellings.
But there are still many unaware of leather leather, so the work we work here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to wash."
He emphasized the importance of checking leather leather before preservation, since possible accidental destruction in one court can kill up to 400 female leaflets and young and destroy all leather leathers in the area.
Leaflets are protected, and it is forbidden to kill, offense, or disturb them, or destroy their reign.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to do with leather leather, and we don’t know how well many of their species are. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape when lawyers prepare a law against a German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of the rape of “false news ” and says that people want to“ draw attention to themselves ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to prosecute the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The president of Portuguese and Juventus has been accused of raping a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the news of Der Spiegel on Friday, he paid her $350,000 afterwards to silence the event.
A few hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33 years old, in Instagram Live, said to his 142 million followers that they were “false news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times at the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added to smiling.
Advocates Ronaldos are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the grounds of the accusations, which they have called “inappropriate disclosure of suspicion of personal life, ” according to Reuters newsroom.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would require a repayment of “the gravity of the break, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
In June 2009, the meant event took place at the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the room of the player, where he was supposed to have rape her in the end of the army, according to documents imposed for the District Court of Clark in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and told her that he was “99 percent of a good man ” who fell into temptation because of “1 percent. ”
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both agreed.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injury at the hospital, but finally agreed to the unity outside the court, because she was “dadly afraid of vengeance operations ” and was concerned about being“ degraded publicly. ”
She now says she wants to stop the sweets because she is still in a struggle after an injured event.
Ronaldo was near to go to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was to take place, and in some some he went to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: Britain would “forgive forever” losing car manufacturers
Britain would “give forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader among the manufacturers of the cars by Brexit, says Greg Clark Business Minister.
He added that it was “anxiety” that Toyota UK would have said to BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a contract, the company would stop temporary production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit had no contract, it would cost reality.
Burnaston manufacturer of Toyota Auris and Avensis cars produced almost 150,000 cars previously, 90% of which were exported to other European countries.
“I believe that if Britain is shocked from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production stations in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Director Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concern over EU exits without agreement on how intermediate businesses should be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that if Brexit becomes an uncontracted reality, what car manufacturers say is a major risk of adhesion.
The Toyota production line is based on the reception of the last hour, where items are delivered every 37 minutes from both stocks in Britain and the EU for cars produced after order.
If Britain declines the EU without a contract on 29 March, it could become disturbances at the borders that the industry believes can lead to delay and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a dagger in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Theresu May Chequers programme for future relations with the EU “is specifically designed to prevent these views at the borders.”
"We must have a deal, we want the best deal that enables us not only to enjoy success in modern times but as an opportunity we can benefit," he said at BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very successful methods.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would be stopped, but he warned that for a long time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a confidential member of the Working Society in the factory, said that his employees are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
“ We have presented a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the European Union, ” said a state speaker of the government.
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Thus, the White House declared on Sunday that a important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the assistant prosecutor, could be “reassured again for one week” now is the dispute of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian elections, links between assistants of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President.
For weeks, historys have been in Washington about whether Trump will run an auxiliary prosecutor, thus endangering Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times stated that Rosenstein had discussed a recording device in order to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of choosing the President from the seat by using the 25th additional section of the governance file.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday he visited the White House, including the news that he was going to say of himself.
Instead, Trump was announced a meeting on Thursday, but he was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said “only ” wants to drive Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed that he was not at the same time as a hearing from the Senatorial Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual extortion, had both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly study of the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote fees of the Senatorial Department.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s media officer, was on a post in Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked for a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It hasn’t been a date for him, it may happen this week, and I think that he may be postponed for a second week because of everything else that is in place at the court.
But we see, and I am always pleased to inform the media."
Some newspapers disagree with this claim: Sanders have not held a newspaper meeting in the White House since September 10.
The interpretation manager Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not dissatisfied by the fact that television newspapers had “visuality, ” but she said:“ I do not agree with the fact that they have visuality. ”
She then gave evidence that the direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions to the media than any other president has done before, ” she said, “We have passed over these figures. ”
“ If the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, ” said Sanders, “it is much better than speaking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of the last few weeks, and it'll replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president may have shown the reason for that in New York this week, when he showed himself inhibitive and in times of strange behavior in front of a group of newspapers.
Health Minister writes EU staff within the health system in Scotland because of the concerns of Brexit
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) in order to express their appreciation and wish to continue working after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of accession to EU staff working within the public service sector.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, discussions between Britain and the European Union have continued because of statements and are expected to take decisions in the autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if possible.
I know this must be a great time of uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I would like to say it again how much I appreciate the work of all the employees, no matter what their nationality is.
Cooperatives from the EU and other countries provide precious experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare services and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergone emergency surgery after having had a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, tennessee State Tiger’s liner, had to undergo emergency surgery after having suffered headaches in 31-27 losses against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report by Mike Organ, journalist Tennessean.
Rod Reed, supervisor Tennessee State, said to the newspapers that the injury had occurred shortly before half a game.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Coachs and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before he was put on the berries and carried out for further consideration.
Agent of Tennessee State told Chris Harris, WSMV radioman in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie was under surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was “no information about the form or severity of the effect yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, in the final year of school, plays his first period with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five makers all on Saturday before he went out of, which increased the total number of makers with him up to 18.
Abroad buyers will be paid for higher stims when buying property in Britain
Agriculture buyers will be payable for higher pollution when buying property in Britain.
The operation will not result in Corbyn's campaign to attract young choosers
Increased stimulation will be applied to those who do not pay tax in Britain
Kingdom treasures estimate 120 million pounds a year to help homeless ones.
Abroad buyers will be payable for higher polls when buying property in Britain. The fund will be used to help homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation is considered to be an attempt to avoid the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young choosers by promising housing at a rewardable price and taxing people more.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain need to pay higher stimulations, and the surplus will take action by the government to assist homeless people.
The increase - which is additional to the current plumbs, including the increase of two years ago in extra homes and property purchases for rent - could be up to three percent.
Kingdom treasure estimates that the increase will increase up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new buildings are purchased by foreign parties, which causes increases in prices and makes it more difficult for those who want to buy property for the first time to get into the market.
Many wealthy areas in the country — especially in the capital — have become “dressing cities ” due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in pollution to help more young people get their first home.
He accused a large building company to keep real estate prices high by buying but not using land, and May urged to stop quotas at homes in order to remedy the home shame of British homes.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of considerable replacements in housing matters, including the rent surveillance and the end of the rent outlet without charge.
He also wants to give counsel more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “In the past I said that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period — that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And that involves fixing our ruined property market.
The door of Britain will always open up those who want to live here, work and build up their lives.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for foreign parties as well as for companies with headquarters in abroad to buy homes as well as for thorough British nationals.
For many the dream of their own house has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Jack Ross, Sunderland's trainer, says that it is his "primary goal" to be a trainer in Scotland ever.
This 42 - year - old Scotch now enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East club, which is now sitting in the third seat of the first department, three levels from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Decoration in the last season.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I got hurt on my knees, so it was done," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there is always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I'd be able to train the department."
Forsvarers of Ross as Sunderland trainers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer of the Alloa athletic club said that he had not felt any fear of following in the footsteps so profound names of such a large club, but he had previously rejected training places at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As is, I will speak my success by thinking: ‘ Can I bring this club back to the decorative department? ’
This club has no doubt at home in the decorative department because of his construction and position," he said.
“ It is not easy to get him there, but I would probably only view myself as a happy one here if I get the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a trainer, after the period as a assistant trainer in Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coach for Hearts.
He helped Alloa to deal with falling into the third branch, and he changed St Mirren, who was about to fall around, to the branch champion next season.
Ross says he was more self-safe now than he was ever at his game at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
“ This was probably a real time, ” he says about the period when he became the trainer of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work fits me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird, for I went well; I had proper earnings of it, and enjoyed a wise success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot each week.
I’m still going through stress and pressure from the job, but the training work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do; I have never felt better with myself in all my adult years."
All the interview can be listened in the Sportsound section on Sunday, September 30 at Radio Scotland between 12 and 13 a.m.
The best time for beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturday, according to a review
The summer temperature has proved to be worthwhile for British bars, but the pressure on restaurants has increased.
Sales in peppers and beats increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to numbers.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Company, who gathered the numbers, said: “The continued sunshine and unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed similar patterns and June, when the bar sales grew by 2.8 percent, except for what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell around 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pabbles and bars, which were mainly dealt with in the drinking sale, had a great deal of upheaval while restaurants went down.
The sun was also difficult for peppers who sold food, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
Sales of drinks in peppers and beats increased by 6.6 per cent per month, but food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from the RSM diagnostic company, said: “These results are the continuation of the swing that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social events or sports events are still the largest factors in selling outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, although sales reductions of 4.8 per cent between months are particularly painful above the continuing pressure due to cost.
This long and hot summer could hardly come to a worse time before dinners and only the time will reveal whether the tempted temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in peppers and restaurants, including in newly opened places, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting how the opens have been managed.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British bar and restaurant farm, collects and reports data from 47 business groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds, and is the industry's industrial approach.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One of five children, up to 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers, according to the results of the survey.
A study of 20,000 students showed an increase in the Insta-side "suite"
The news has increased concerns about the publication of sexual matters
Twenty percent of students say they have "main" accounts they show parents
One of five children, up to 11 years old, creates secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study that reached 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the Insta accounts - a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has increased concern about the publication of sexual matters.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a “primary ” account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother that fell down on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to “profane me. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Head of Private School (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them acknowledged that they had a secret bill.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, said: “It is anxiety that so many teenagers are tempted to create an online area where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Voice of Sporters" in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected in the Scottish Athletics Committee as no executive officer at the annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle, the most successful free sports woman of Scotland and Ian Beattie, chairman of the Committee, said that the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field last decade.
“Eildh enjoys great respect in the sports community in Scotland, Britain and international, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it in the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on the hand of sportsmen and hope that I will be able to take part in my efforts and help to carry on sports in Scotland. ”
The American winner of the Olympics in the Atlantic Games in 1996, who has a total of four Olympic Gold, and is now regularly visited by BBC, was paralysed after transient blood loss.
He wrote on Twitter: “For one month I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only the time would reveal whether I was normal and then how much.
This has been a hard job, but I used to get full, learn to walk again, and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your encouragement!"
The advertising of chest pumps that compare mothers with cows causes a network disagreement
A company that produces breast-feeding pumps is now reported on the Internet because of advertising that carries lactating mothers with cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a new advertising to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the first silent breast pump of the world that can be carried out”. The advertising is inspired by musical videos and should show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a cage full of hoy and cow at songs like: “Yeah, I milk myself, but you see no stairs on me” and “If you did not observe it, these are not yokes, but my breasts.”
The supplement continues: “Pumpe, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, pump, I pump milk from the yells. ”
However, the advertising, which appears on the Facebook page of the company, has caused an advertising on the Internet.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of reviews, and it has had a disagreement from the audiences, which many say it was gantted with the “wheel ” that follows the milk industry.
“ Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just as we are, they must be filled with calfs, and bear to produce milk, except for what the calfs are taken from them only a few days after they are born,' said one review.
Elvie breast pumpkin fits comfortably in a breast-feeding container (Elvie/Mother)
Another audience wrote: “It’s hard for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who may keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertising is totally out of time. ”
Others defended the advertising, and one woman acknowledged that her feature was “awesome. ”
“ I think this is a great idea.
I'd have bought that way if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping out milk.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “This is a fun advertising that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside the bathroom) and feels like “coom. ”
This is not an advertising that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the advertising, the female group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cow when pumping out milk.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires or guides and fits comfortably in a breast container, which gives women freedom to move, keep their child and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and supervisor of Mother, said: “The Elvie pumpa is so revolutionary that she deserved an outstanding presentation that would bring an opinion.
By comparing women we cows, we wanted to direct the castlelight to the breast pump and all its challenges, even showing in a entertaining and well - known way how much freedom the new pumpa would give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pumpa got into the news.
In the London fashion week, a mother of two children showed a fashion show for the designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved quietly to tabernacles at the border of Texas
The number of migrants in the preservation has suddenly increased even though the number of those who cross the borders of the month has somehow remained the same; part of the reason is that hard speech and policies established by the government of Trump have made it more difficult to bring children into temporary abortion.
Usually, the foster parents have been unauthorized immigrants themselves, and have feared to put their chances of remaining in danger, by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities reported that possible foster parents and other adults in their homes would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the migrant supervision.
Last week, Matthew Albence, Chief of the Immigration and Customs Supervision, witnessed before the elderly and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who sought to foster a single child.
The foundation later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not in charge.
“ Almost 80 percent of those who are either the foster parents or the homes of children are illegal in the country, and many of them are illegal immigrants.
“ So we keep looking for their individuals, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the children’s affairs, representatives announced new rules that require that some of the children appear in the courtroom within a month from their preservation, rather than after 60 days, previously established, according to the professionals who work in the workshops.
Many of them will come through videos, rather than personally, to give evidence of their legal position before judges in immigrant matters.
The children who are condemned unable to enter the country are sent quickly from the country.
The longer children are preserved, the more likely they are to become anxiety or depression, which can lead to violence or refugee experiments, according to the staff of the homes and reports published by the system over the past months.
Speakers said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice even though a child is difficult, because of the number of them.
So they added that the transfer of children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could increase the disaster that many of them are already faced with.
Syria says the United States, France and Turkey to return immediately
Walid al-Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of the Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false prejudice that they were fighting terrorism, and “that they were treated accordingly. ”
“ They must move back immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the Congress.
Moualem firmly claimed that “the war against terrorism was almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to pursue this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian areas“ from both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise cowboys and Syrian Arubs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war - threatened country.
As regards the matter of refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were good enough to enable them to return and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread out reasonless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on international society and humanity associations to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They are creating political matters from something that should be merely humanity. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The Erindrocher S.U. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a neutral area at the last major contests of opposition has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented great attacks by Syrian armies of Russia in the region of three million people.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed the fact that the contract had a “definite finish” and described the hope that military operations would be directed to the Jihadisms, including Nusra Front fighters, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they would be “destructed. ”
The Staff de Mistura, Ambassador S.D., hopes to meet the first meetings with a new committee as members of the government and the opposition, to organise a system of governance for Syria after the war and pay the street for elections.
Moualem presented conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, and said that her work should be limited to “going over the rules of the current government” and warned against all interventions.
Reason for Trump to win another election period
According to that reasoning, Mr. Trump would make the re-evaluation in 2020, unless accusations and shocks would end his presidential process, as many freely viewers are likely to hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of presidential life ever! ”
Like a viewer, there are no tired marks.
Since 2014, views in the best time have increased more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN, and almost threefolds up to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show” has toped the watch with up to 3.5 million audiences of important news evenings.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, member of the ABC drama program “Designed Survivor” on a person in the government who becomes president after the Senate was destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced gentleman and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another idea.
She remembers a ride in a taxi in Boston for the elections in 2016.
The driver told her that he was going to choose Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Miss Scovell to me.
There are entertainment values in the unrest.
Unlike what is shown on television, however, Washington’s stories could determine the destiny of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants’ families can unite with the health of the international economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privileges are able to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth time of a group of experts reasoning the use of Bob Woodwards on “very close” sources for his book “Fear,” or $15,000 jackets from the beaches that Paul Manafort was dressed (“like born with pride,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
I will at least never see Super Mario the same eyes again.
“A part of what he does and lets a man feel this is like a reality thing, that he gives you something every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the “Pawn Stars” parts, when he discussed the worker’s race in the show of Trumps and daily changes in the history thread (e.g. starting a fight with N.F.L. and commendation in Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one thing, or you'll lose your desire.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, 26 degrees of heat and sunshine were outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and looked at MSNB while he took up CNN.
He could not cut himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be witnessed before the Senatorial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in question.
“I remember when we made all these crazy features in ancient times and people said, “this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought this was some kind of joke, but it was evident that people were right. ”

Money to Flow Out in the Nearest Choice of the Middle Period
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17nd choosing area sees the money flowing, thanks to the reorganization of the choosing areas that led to two representatives race around the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area is sending forward to the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won its seat in another choosing area last summer.
Lamb presents himself to other representatives, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representative of the old 12th electoral area of Pennsylvania, which is very contrary to the new 17th electoral area.
The maps of chores were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old chores were organized in the interests of the Republics and that it violates the governance.
The race in the new 17th electoral area has been launched in the funding of election campaigns between the main financial partners of both categories, the Democratic Electoral Committee (DCCC) and the NRCC (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a little victory in the special elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania, but many followed the elections.
The republics had previously defeated its seat for more than a decade, and Donald Trump, the president, won a victory of 20 degrees.
Political experts have given democrats some priority.
The United States thought to punish El Salvador for the support of China, but then resigned.
Employers noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with little objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, in June 2017, and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the owner of the Trump team disappeared.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “new decisions to no longer acknowledge the Tavan, ” said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Ministry in early this month.
However, penalties were considered solely against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for aid in 2017, including drug surveillance, development and economic support.
The refusal, which was envisaged and included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence, would have been painful for the Central America country, with a high unemployment rate and high incidence of death.
As domestic meetings continued, the US and Mediterranean representatives of the Security and Economic Success Conference postponed to follow a similar meeting that was previously held and thought to be a step forward in action to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But about mid - September, representatives from the top rows made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, so they ended all the absences of punishment against El Salvador.
Mr. Mike Pence, Vice - President, is now addressing the conference to be held in the middle of October as a symbol of how important it is in the eyes of the government, said the actors.
The three transmitters of the United States also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions described by the three American representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the indoor conversations against being nameless.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external diagnosis who works closely with the government and also spoke about the matter against unnamedness.
Learning the History
The next offense could be Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, report on Mr. Trump's possible actions to prevent justice, but for that accusation there are numerous public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turned his investigation to whether Mr. Trumps' election campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the congress is controlled by another group, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to meet his choosers again, and perhaps the abdomen of his appointed companions.
However, these are very uncertain and I do not want to say that Trump's fall is unambiguous, nor his colleague in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the long battle.
In 1938, German counselors were prepared to rob Hitler’s power, only if Western countries had given him opposition and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
The history turns around such important points and speeds or delays for the inevitable democracy’s conduct.
The Americans are faced with some of these important points now.
What if Mr. Trump runs Mr. Rosenstein's prosecutor, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret records of the president and discussed whether he was inappropriate in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times news is not right.
“ How will we react if the newly requested study of Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual extortion and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we choose a Senate in the middle period that will give Mr. Trump responsibility?
If we fall under these tests, the democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I think we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that was sitting in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to fire on the Sabbath candles on the table with the hake cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I, except, look positively to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Rangers' lieutenant, the optimism of the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory of the Austrian men will make them in a strong position to get out of the G group of Europeans.
Measurement on the knee prevented the medieval of Graham Dorrans from playing his first game during the game before in the game against Villareal that ended with 2-2 equals, but he thinks that Rangers can use the finals as a jumping board to improve results.
“ It was good to get this point for us, for Villarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorran, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have sought a victory at the end, but on the whole, it was likely that it was fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got strongly into the second half game and played better.
On Thursday, another important evening is for the European Department.
Hopefully, we can reach three points, but it's gonna be a hard game because they went well in their last game, but with the watchers who support us, I'm sure we'll endure this and get a positive decision.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injury and the changes that became in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling.
The team is good, and the boys enjoy their own, the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move further now, put the last season behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing retirement savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, few discussed this with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide Survey said they were talking to their mate about the cost of long - term study.
Only 10 percent said they were talking this to their children.
“ People want family members to care about it, but they don’t take the right steps to have them conversations, ” said Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of Nationwide Life Insurance Department.
Here we go.
Talk to your mate and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes clear with a good warning.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you receive care, for these options can change much in terms of cost.
Consider your financial counselor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this expense.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term research are traditional life assurance with long-term care, mixed life assurance that pays for money, to help pay costs, or self-security with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal dispute.
Get a healthcare officer so that you can name someone you trust in supervising your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals meet your wishes if you cannot tell them directly out yourself.
Consider also to have a procura for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot make it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older father or mother is in a emergency situation and is on the way to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give these information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It is not only about the financial matters but also about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“Who are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be ready for that plan."

Earthquakes and flooding waves in Indonesia
At least 384 left life after a powerful earthquake and a flood wave in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said representatives, and the number of dead is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, helpers have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu, which is close to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter.
Over 16,000 people were left in Pala after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of the Mid-Sulawes district, is located at the bottom of a narrow flood on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was on its 40 - year birthday when the earthquake and the flooding wave came on.
Donggala is a state of more than 380 miles [380 km] of the northwestern Sulawesi island.
In 2017, the state of the district had an estimated population of 299.200.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of the Middle-Sulawes region, especially in Donggala's coastal area.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, most of which are in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawes.
A number of times last century, according to the Indonesian Emergency Institute, flooding waves have scaled in Palu and Donggala.
In 1938, over 200 people died when a flood raid attacked, and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, there is also a wave of floods on the west part of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia is sitting on the active circuit of the Pacific, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and flooding waves in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in the northern part of Sumath ran over on December 26 and started a flood wave that swept to 14 countries and killed 226,000 people across the coastline of the Indian Sea, of which was more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong trembles passed over the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds of people die on the island of Nia, from the shore of Sumath.
2006: A earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter railed over the southern part of Judah, the largest island of Indonesia, and caused a wave of floods that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A earthquake up to 7.6 at Richter railed over near Padang, the capital of the western district of Sumath.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake up to 7.5 on Richter railed over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumathra, and raised up to 10 feet [10 m] high flood waves that destroyed the number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The foundation of earthquake raged the Pidie Jaya County of Aceh and caused destruction and anxiety when people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and floods in 2004.
There was no wave of floods for this time, but more than 100 people died when buildings fell.
2018: Great trembles ravage over the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of travelers were temporarily stuck on the island.

The earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter, began a flood wave and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication systems are lower and the number of dead is expected to rise in the next days.

Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want a death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, suspected to have participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the county for violation of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, a 30 - year - old, is thought to have taken a Home Depot truck on a rent to attack people on a bike road along the West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “willingly ” and caused serious physical injuries“ willingly, ” according to the willing declaration of using a death penalty recorded in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these prosecutors can lead to possible death penalties, according to the court document.
A number of weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of the federal judgment in 22 teams, including eight accusations of murder for a criminal purpose, usually used by prosecutors in accusations against organised crime associations, and was also accused of violent crime and to destroy a car.
The attack included “a considerable planning, ” said the accusers, declaring Sapiov’s action as“ terrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was caused to physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” says the statement.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
It has been a decade since Southern New York the last death punishment for treatment.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug sales but was finally sentenced in lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a trial in New York in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who had been killed after being convicted for spying for the Soviet States in the Cold War two years earlier.
Both couples were killed on June 19, 1953, at the power chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of the repentance of the days and months after the attack, according to documents.
He said to an investigator that he was fine with what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching videos from ISIS in his phone, according to what the accusation said.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital, said the police.
He has declared his innocentness in all 22 parties of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s official defenders, said that they were “of course disappointed ” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We believe that the decision to ask for death punishment instead of accepting a guilt declaration against lifetime prison without a possibility of experience will only extend the struggle for this event for all part-holders,” said Patton.
Saipov's defendants had previously asked a prosecutor not to seek death punishment.
The president of the Consumer Group says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct contractual interviews on the basis of Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised today to “act the army of the people ” with protests at the conference.
This former leader Ukip said that politicians would have to “exist pressure ” from doubters about the European Union at the same time as one of Theresu May’s parliaments suggested that he should conduct the negotiations with the EU.
At the Birmingham protest walk, Container Peter Bone said that if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit, Britain would “be gone out ” now.
However, the challenge faced by May to satisfy a deep dispute between her own teams was even more evident when the inhabitants, who want to remain in the EU, participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers plan on the right path and sitting under the criticism of those who are defeated by Brexit, those opposed, and the EU.
The United States claimed that it would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition and force those opposed to Brexit and the Workers' Group to choose between its plans and “infringements”.
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leave protest walk in Solihull that he wanted to “resolve the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been allowed to participate and should have the responsibility of dealing with Brussels.
"If he was at the board, we would have gone out now," he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out that the opinion of the public had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public changed views and wants to stay is absolutely untrue. ”
Andrea Jenkyns, a sustained supporter of Brexit, was also at the protest course and said to the newspapers: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is hostile among the public, and the opposition will not choose with it, and it will enjoy the enemy among our classes and the actors who are on the streets and choose us.
Please, stop Chequers' plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “President ministers keep their work when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr Farage said that politicians would have to “people pressure ” if they were to fail the decision taken following the vote in 2016.
“ This is now about trust between our people and our political class, ” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, "We won't let you get up with this."
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political group, who is facing Brexit.
We operate the army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-governant, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest course in Birmingham, which ended with a two - time protest meeting in the city.
A small group of operationists victoryed the flags of the Containers against Brexit after the group was set up during the weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Worker Group, made jokes to inhabitants because of security problems encountered in the class’s telephone program when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have all computer systems okay and all technology for Canada plus, for borders without obstacles, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“ This is a total disaster.
There's nothing that can be called good Brexit," he said.

Arrest after a deadly shooting attack on Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspected in the case of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 years at a news meeting at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting attack on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man who saw the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the Southern University University early on Friday.
“ Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died because of it, ” said the policeman Murphy J. Paul, at the media on Saturday, according to a 247 - sport report.
Wayde came to the defense of his friend and was shot by Simpson.

Grand Prix, Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat in order of their team.
It was evident since Valtteri Botta’s seat before Lewis Hamilton was reached before the launch on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two curves and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel first went into the ceiling and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to make decisions.
The Mercedes car went into the ceiling one ring later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a few struggles where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after having had the risk of remaining, after defence attempts in the third curve.
Max Verstappen began back in the group and was at the seventh seat at the end of the first ring, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the races when he delayed changing the tyres to try to finish quickly and get out of Kimi Raikkon and reach a fourth seat.
Eventually, he went into the grave in the 44th circle, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rings, and Raikkon took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, because Valtteri stood beautifully all weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has stood greatly to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
This was really a bad body suppression.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made fun of the Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with a charge against Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, on sexual extortion.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly the Ford’s witness to the Elders ’ decision committee, but he said that what was going on at the Senatorial Assembly showed that people were “wrong and cruel and unfair. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful things that have been going on in the last days of the elderly department, when you see the anger, when you see people who are roared and bad and cruel and unreasonable, ” he said.
“ When you see the spots and leaks and then say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you have this?
Remember the answer of her... you will end the document - “Oh, huh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not laughing."
Just wait slowly.
Let's go... no, we didn't lock it," he said, "and imitated the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh were presented, so early in September, Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“ I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I did not make her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it secretly, and I did what she asked me to do. ”
But her denial seemed not to be good at the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I'll tell you, this was really a bad exercise.
Maybe she doesn't laugh, but this was the worst body suppression I've ever seen."
The President continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual extortion by three women, and suggested that the Democrats were making use of the accusations in their interests.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods to use.
You see the cruelty, the evil, whoever they hurt, who they have to overtake to gain power and control," said the president, according to the mediaite news.

The authorities fear that the number of the dead may exceed a thousand, when the country’s disaster institution says that access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ The figure is that the number of dead continues to rise because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot reach them, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Agency.
Up to six feet [6 m] [6 m] of ages] has caused a huge destruction in Pala, where there will be a multitude of funerals on Sunday.

There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."

A specialist describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors concluded their speech in the resumption of a case against a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the United States Department of Justice, was in the courtroom for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.

Rowlett said that she had received location data from some mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to the news from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed Saturday and said he hadn’t been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked that Tellis was saying he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phones showed that they had only known for one week.
Rowlett said that after the death of Chambers, Tellis had wiped out text messages, phone rings, and contact information from her phone.
“ He destroyed her from his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that the defendants will deliver their final talk on Sunday.
The Judge said he expected that the matter would be brought before abdomen later on that day.

Another black person?!
A child in New York laws a couple for withdrawal after a “prejudiced” text message
A foster in New York laws a couple for an unlawful withdrawal after she received an accidental text message from her mother, complaining that she was “one other black person. ”
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and compares the prosecution with “depression. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, declared dissatisfaction when she found that her new foetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEIIIII OTHER ANSWER MANY" wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them to Miss Maurice twice.
After discovering their mistakes, the “shamest” of the Plasco-Flaxman, Ms. Maurice, said that, according to a news report from New York Post, a former child who was black had stood bad.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber’s car.
Maurice is now prosecuting the couple and wants to get improvements for the withdrawal, that a total of $350 a day for the six months of her initial work, although no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she interviewed Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have protested against the accusations of prejudice and say that it was the right thing to drive Maurice, because they did not feel that they could trust her after being insulted.
“ My wife sent her a message she wouldn’t say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“ But who would trust his children for someone after showing the same stupidity, even though it was surprised?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawyer with “depression, ” and said that his wife had arrived seven months and was in“ very difficult circumstances. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very beautifully done," said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The matter is still in court, but the public has spoken hard about the couple on social media and embarrassed them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would have difficulties with speaking bears, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to step in the footsteps of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
“ It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s huge success. ”
She said that her father, who worked as a carrier of BBC before he was inspired to write a children’s book about a little toy bear, had rejected his actions with a calm positive attitude, and added that the sixties ’ birthday of the book was “sweet ” after his death in the past.
With regard to Paddington, which she describes as “a very important member of the family, ” she added that her father had proved silently proud of his success.
“ He was a very silent man, and he wasn’t used to make himself, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does something.
I think he had somehow looked at Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor of himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been moved to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad regularly called and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the physicians had given her to maintain the heart rate were gradually losing their activity and being excreted from the body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body to give up.
I had to sit there waiting, knowing this was all about.
I could not cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning her dead daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“ No one knew anything, ” she said.
“ I drowned my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt deep compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Laying women hang up a message to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who had loved ones who had suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have set up a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and receive help.
Tyler, son of Miss Davis, 13 years old, began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel as I need to feel every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that her son had been a successful cook with a infective smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could describe any room."
He quit working before he died, for he was “sucked down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was found dead after his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it’s the result. ”
Ms. Davis made the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don't sit and say nothing--you need to talk to someone."
Miss Humphrey, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, his mate up to 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t say anything about his feelings of depression or depression or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mind.
He was up to his worst in Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that his death was a great shock for them, but that they would have to resolve: “This could break the family.
This will break us apart.
But we have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a blue thread when the FBI has its research
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - study with limited time and scope - we might get a little satisfied,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be “separated” in the middle of a dispute between the groups where everything was in the back slot.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Group want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their tiredness is because of the time.
In only five weeks, on November 6, the Middle Age decisions will weaken their serious attempts to make his man choose to sit in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr. Bush’s private carrier.
What happens after the FBI releases their research report?
The Elders’ Assembly, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit, will be voted.
It is still unlikely that Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the elderly branch, but this would make Mike Pence, Vice President, capable of breaking up the level and confirming him in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea “decreases” under Kim's control
The number of refugees from North Korea and traveling to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jongun came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-sea, quoted data from the South Korean Council and said that 1127 people had escaped last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that more stringent border warning between North Korea and China and higher charges dealt with by smugglers with people are key elements.
Pyongyang has not published any public declaration.
A large majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to have a South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have gone illegally over the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, but they have the longest borders to North Korea, and it is easier to pass over them rather than a neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them to return to their homeland.
The communication between North and South Korea, which is still in war, has technically improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions mainly about delayed agreements on nuclear weapons.
This was after a historical meeting in June between President Donald Trump and President Kim Jong in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in crude drains towards the nuclear korean jungle.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, taught American business relations about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certain certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first, ” said Ri in his speech at the SD General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "made sick" and says he is inappropriate to perform the work of the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in a parliament, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court of Justice, “Motherly ill, ” and said that he was too clever to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi sent these words to an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I could only think that if a woman had ever done this, she had been called mother - sick, ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senatorial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the feeling that he had offended Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotionate, and at times he threw up a cry and got a crack in his neck when he talked about his family and his school years.
He also condemned publicly democrats in the committee and called the accusations on him “innocent and organized murders ” organized by free - tempered people who were angry with the loss of the predecessions in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was partial to democrats.
“I think these claims and how he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats show that he is inappropriate to the work, ” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh dismissed if he was confirmed and if the Democrats reach the majority of the assembly.
“I shall say this: if he is not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only unable to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at the jurisdiction of Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she would be worried about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a preservative judge.
At the interrogation, Kavanaugh ignored questions about whether he would converse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a mother-in-law, a partial person to go to the Supreme Court, expecting us to say "that is wonderful." Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is righteous speech, months, and years of anger, so it does not come from her without crying.
“ We wept when we get angry, ” said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
“ I think it’s not uncommon, but you? ”
She continued, “I received great help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began to cry, she said to her attendant,“ You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to express some wrath because they are misunderstood in basic terms.
One of my most clear memories from the former work I spent in a office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of anger that I couldn’t express, a elderly woman came and took me into my necklace. She was a cold boss, which I had always feared a little and she pulled me into the stairway.
“ Let them never see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're bullshit.
They believe that you are sad and rejoiced that you have come into thee."
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in a presidential procurement, but she was then a democrat senator from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested by the prosecution of a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled her offer back, Ms. Schroeder, full of wrath, said that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the President.
“ This was not a well - thought decision, ” she laughed at me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other providers and the last thing they needed to do was one more.
Someone gave this name, "White and the seven dwarfs."
Since the election campaign had passed far, she was dependent on the funding, so she promised not to offer herself unless she was able to collect two million dollars.
The fight was lost.
She found that some of her supporters gave her $1,000 to men only $250.
“ Do they think I get a breakdown? ” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overcome by feelings - thankful to the people who had supported her, angry with the system, which made it so difficult to gain money and direct her visions to electors instead of representatives, and anger into the sex mixture - that she broke into cry.
“ I might have had a nervous attack, ” said Miss Schroeder, remembering how media responded.
“ It could be thought that Kleenex was my strength partner.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my leg stone?
"She cryed?"
Why business wars between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the business war between the United States and China were exciting, and even though the war is far from the end, the intergovernmental situation could be a long - term benefit for Beijing, says experts.
President of the United States, Donald Trump, shot the first warning message earlier this year by putting taxes on China’s main export goods, including sunrises, steel, and aluminium.
This week’s highest score came with new duties that cover goods to $200 billion ($150 billion) and taxes almost half of all lips that are transported into the United States from China.
Peking has replied at the same coin each time and recently added 5 to 10 percent to US goods to $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States’ customs duties, and it is unlikely that another world’s largest economic system will give up.
In order to get Washington to hope, it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President China to turn publicly from the United States.
However, experts say that if Peking keeps the cards right, pressure from the business war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need for both sectors for each other.
“ The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could lead to situations that lead to economic disruption in each country, is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have recognized before, ” said Abigail Grace, researcher who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria “prepared” for refugees to return, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country would improve.
“ Today, the state of the earth is downward and safer, thanks to its success in the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to undergo normal circumstances by building areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
All is now ready for refugees to return to the country where they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unanimous economic decisions against their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more people who still live in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to accept help in rebuilding the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or aid from countries who supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder cup in Paris
Europe has won the Ryder cup in 2018 by victoring the United States' team with the final score 16.5 versus 10.5 points in the Le Golf National field outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in order on a European basis and have not won Ryder cups in Europe since 1993.
Europe reapplied to the krone when the team, under the leadership of Danish leader Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulties of the race, struck his initial slope down into the water on the 16th hole, par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined sharply in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the results 5-0-0, since the competition started using its current profile in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the European team's players' order.
Dustin Johnson, at the top seat of the list of best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who could play in his last race about the Ryder cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about the Ryder cup, became the victoriousst European racer at a level of 25.5 squares.
“ I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
This has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that I have chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was delighted to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He delivered his lands to John Rahm, but he victoryed the American Gulf Gospel Tiger Woods 2&1 in a lonely game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud of the victory of Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race about the Ryder cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who have worked 14 big titles and is only in the second seat after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had the whole weekend hard to find themselves on the field, outside Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game through all the races.
The U.S. leader, Jim Furyk, said, after disappointing his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was someday the morning that we pressured Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take it down for Thomasi.
He's a great leader.
All his 12 players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and I'll call Ryder the cup and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men, and I'm proud of being their leader.
You have to take it down.
They played better than we."
