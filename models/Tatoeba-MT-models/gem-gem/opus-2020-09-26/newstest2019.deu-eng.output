DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel does not currently see the basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on the fact that one comes into the conversation that one also talks to him about why he seems to have felt it as it is laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "picture".
Despite the monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that it would be the same at a certain time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had explained his retirement from the DFB team in July and also justified it with the reason that he had not defended against racist oppositions during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism to Özil that he is not ready for a conversation with the federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or change a association, you talk about it with your trainer and I'm sorry that this conversation hasn't happened until now."
Linz: Garden hut in Schreberg-Artensiedlung burned
At 14.13 p.m., Linz was alarmed for a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly through the Schreberg species settlement, the danger was delayed.
The vocational fire force exploded and found the hut in full fire.
The roof had to be practically removed to the gorge and to the necessary extent of fire shooting was removed.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had found a battery for the shop at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, the charger was in the area of the largest intensity of fire.
The damage caused by the fire must still be detected, as well as the cause of fire.
However, he is likely to be considerable, for the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry mother denounces: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What has Lindsay Lohan only led to this very strange action?
She seemed to want to ride the children of a claimed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") himself has flowed lively, as she seems to want to escape the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the US Portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial median of the stream.
Here you see "For luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes from the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and her children.
She prosecutes adults to deal with children.
For all this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this just," Lohan is to hear in the video how she continues following the family along the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
Sometimes, however, it seems to be enough for the apparent wrathful mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misss an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress deserves the shock she is - and she keeps the wang.
What Lohan has moved to this action is quite unclear at the moment.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Sond "Hayabusa2" started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is intended to draw closer to the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Abroad-ticker: Number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the heavy earthquake of strength 7,5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths are spoken.
The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet been invaded in the devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as the chairman of the Supervisory Board
In the beginning, there was a Tweet.
In early August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk made the stock markets disturbance when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletroautobuilder.
The U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisor charged him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla-Chef withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but the Chairman of the Board may remain.
Date of the party of the British Conservatives
Sharp guard - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power fight.
On the party day it is intended to deal with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, at the front front Ex-Ex-Minister Boris Johnson.
Reference for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplicates for years.
Now they have agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be called Northern Macedonia, and this Sunday the population agrees - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against law-populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against the law-populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in the forefront of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Worker Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" updating lasts longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce is still there," said Peter Mertens' development director, "Automobile Week" in the industry.
In December 2017, the arrested and advocated Audi-Chef Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/drive combinations were expected to have been examined," he said at that time.
Mertens now said: "In early July we reached an important stage goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel Scandal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board defended a decision on Stadler's future and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities propose to the Audi-Chef to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values, after the exhaust fraud is known.
He knew about the manipulations, or he was consciously ignored them.
Currently, sales manager Bram Schot heads the company as Commissioner Board Manager.
As a result of the conversion to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production deficiencies at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronner Voice".
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 that are produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Scot's on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi Electroauto, there are already 15.000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-selection - Lahm should be in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair in the next year, wants to reconsider for the office as DFB president.
"I do my work and try to make her as well as it is," said Grindel as a guest on early Sunday morning in the "current sports studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the Association would find it "noteworthy" if he, after the suggestion for the football-EM 2024, had not "the desire to cooperate in the future project".
Grindel has been the head of the Association since April 2016 as a successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, which has been crashed over the summer march affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB Friday of 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Chef organiser Philipp Lahm is supposed to cooperate in the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues agree with the Bureau that he will be consulted in this role in the future with the Bureau and then, of course, warmly invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," said Grindel.
In speculations, whether his follower could become a DFB chef, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence from the affair of the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grinddel expressed the desire to be a national player without the migration background to become the integration message of the DFB.
At present, this office is exercising Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, and the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is a person without the background of migration that clearly influences society and football, and says, "the topic is important, we need to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations in the place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Reduce correctly with semi-slimping weight
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that takes not only my weight, but also the body fat.
Muscle and bone mass can also show them.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's rather for the wrist.
He doesn't tell me if I've replaced fat by muscles.

Erdoğan opens Moschee in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Moschee in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at his three-day visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan invited the German government to deliver living attendants of the golden movement in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisants of the PKK or golden movement to shake our citizens and to harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
The Cologne city had been partly locked for the opening of the Ditib Moschee.
Several thousand police officers were in operation - among them they were also scarf shooters.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is deemed to be the longer arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhrops and Horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have incurred more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in the New York Central Park.
"Be engaged wherever you can only," said Mendes at the festival in the night on Sunday before about 60.0000 viewers.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and willing to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations showed themselves at the more-hour spectacle on the stage.
Meanwhile, however, there was a scary chronology when many spectators thought the noise of a surrounding metal creature for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Soon panic arose, people ran apart.
Seven spectators had been easily injured, said the organiser Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin reassured the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free of charge as each year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to be married had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was audiences of joy and applause - Buhrufe on the other hand for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken out in the US Senate Legal Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge at the Supreme Court and thus hit many women in the head.
At least three women have suspected abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake demanded a FBI examination of the accusations, after two women, who have experienced their own data, even sexual abuses, faced him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also enjoy meeting at any time in an elevator with me," Flake now said at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government defends the discharge of the journalist
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the discharge of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Kanzleramt, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German label "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance of the expiry of the press conference.
As a result of the journalist's action, there was a strong disturbance, which was unacceptable.
That's why he caused personnel protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies completely independently of whether it is a legitimate matter or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are charged with claimed spying activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah golden movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed puzch attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten a number of decades of prison.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested at the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the prisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actress was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moisturous conversations at the theke of Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, hits some beer, some wines or even more high-percentage drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few promises also drink courage for compulsory singing deposits.
On Friday another success of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actress Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Menherzen", "Terror - your judgment" or "The best day".
But the Munich did not get a good trip to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a selfish - his face is completely cracked on it, the eyes only two small slices.
The bed self shows a completely luxurious Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he now gained: "Rule one: Don't go to Inas night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round of egg liquor that Ina cuts around half three leaves away as well.
Alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted just a few tips to combat the distress.
They were enough of instant browns, fishbreads or - presumably the most targeting - headache tablets.
Others just enjoyed the view of the usually attractive Kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night's storage, it is not known to date.
But since she has been moderating the TV fun at the theke since 2007, the 53-year-olds seem to be clearly tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and disgusting
The entrance to the 36 kilometers long railway in the Red Cupland in Treysa is very difficult to find and tolerate.
Recepts against the grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly reflected.
Sharpens, cigarette chicks, waste and unratch, demolated wastewashers and now demonstrated signs - this has been a long time since the entry with the seat group to the cycling road on the Haße Hill in Treysa.
For the foregoing object Railway in the Red Cupland a more than unfamiliar view.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC site group Schwalmstadt, but others have been already, says the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wöstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed by the cycling council.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals were sufficient from the transfer of the seat group to regular removal of waste containers and cleaning the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also included in the local council.
Not only the waste drives cyclists and inhabitants - the seat group is a regular meeting point on weekends to celebrate.
It is not only often speaking, but also destroyed in the layers: peppers ripped out of the earth, wastewasher demolated, shields knicked around, seat furniture dirted.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the word-writing drops on the hot stone.
You're upset that the racing area on the cycling road in Treysa is a meeting point for supplies.
"Besides the entire cycling path here is clearly the focus on the Hades hill," the cyclist confirms, who is now also concerned about the new cycling place in goat shark, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it'll be pretty expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hill: "There may be a significant increase in the threshold of interference.
This would, however, require that there will be a police strike in time.
In principle, desert Copenhagen wants to develop the Haße Hill.
He needs to be more attractive.
The spectrum of the cycling routes to date could be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expansionable.
Our cycling route is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," says the ADFC members.
ADFC member, Susanne Klippert, appreciates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no debie track on the hatch hill.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the road,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but well for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in each other.
"D offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district officer Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eyewear in the sympathetic Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family companion at coffee and cake from the honorary officials of the Culture Railway Station.
Seven formations came from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albath in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup Star Colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and eventually Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This contest, as stated by District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a new one.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What did the textiles see?
In the places the Hiltrup Sea and the marketallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Himig swore the only one in his shameful song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Culture Railway Station was also appreciated.
It was repeatedly about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or indications about their creation.
Thus it was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry but now also taught guitars.
From the musical engineer Stefan Schemelmann Franke knew to report that the recently occurred in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed everything on Youtube in the meantime.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup's gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others can hear their songs too.
A whole CD can record Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schimmelmann.
Other musicians can take a song: He with his Hiltrup camp, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the final again - and even sounded "rightly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
Heading allowed the jury from the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, entrance of the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfat von KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City District Offensive.
The district officer had brought the event into life because of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the very very full cultural station soon.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams who sit with each other.
For each page there is a screen of view, in which four cards with keywords that - the old trick with the red slide - can only be decrypted when you put them in.
This ensures that the other side can not read anything from accident.
For example, on the cards is to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Twoth window.
Third dice.
Fourth party.
These are the terms that are now to be encrypted.
For here are not the terms, but codes to be guessed.
Alternatively a player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
In "decrypto" the terms should be advised not behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: in this order and in this example, he is supposed to describe the terms "cube", "Fest" and "window" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponential team is not possible; for it wins the party if it fails to knock the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads hardly: "Shaps" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, would be something like "party" and "Prag" because he was watching at school and knowing the window crash there.
That's how it goes for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the concepts of the opposite - this can be better combined with any reference given by the encryptor there.
If possible, mysterious, but not to turn off, the rescriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptical to "decrypto" is the rules.
The fellow players must probably study it very long and detailed until they can finally play.
The declaration video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has first released will be fascinated how much feeling is in this insignificant game.
In total, however, "decrypto" is not as solid as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also depends on an agent theme on a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever's only about rating and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and disturbing guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man worked the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday on Sunday equally twice.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the upper city of a passing police strike, and later he also noticed in the upper city in a trick when he inflicted other guests.
After he was not clearly alcoholized by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection in Kulmbach in the prison.
In the state of law, he must also be legally responsible for the use of signs of constitutional organisations.
Working Pressed was the home of the shoe blocks
The railway operation in Pressig has been the circuit in Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffer was cracked on buffer, it was heard in the press," George Dinkel recalls, which archives the history of the place and the station.
Nobody did that.
There the brakes also calmed and the wagons gnattered.
It was just a railway clean.
Pronunciations that are symbolic for Dinkels homeland Pressy.
Nowhere in Frankenwald a place was so characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain route to the north, which has its hill point in Steinbach at the forest after an increase of about 220 hectares.
In order to handle this, earlier train and shoe blocks were needed that had their home in pressy.
In 1901, the Bavarian country day approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, teaching workshops, driving and railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the turning disc that had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, rail historian and 47 years of professional railway railways.
The station (BW) Pressig, which was signed in 1968 by Bamberg, also operated Loks for the adjacent routes Pressig - Tttau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northern.
On July 15, 1950, the "volksblatt" reported a 160 men's staff; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in pressy.
The electricalisation of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 walls were ranged in the month.
In 1982, parts of the work were cancelled, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is sad that you have not seen a better use of the location, including in point of goods traffic."
At Pentecost 1989, the train director Nürnberg celebrated a pumpous railway station festival in Pressig at the anniversary of "50 years of electricalization Nürnberg - Salfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," George Dinkel recalls.
Let's get it out later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangerbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rankiers and obstacles did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Train Station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led for the reverse of the hierarchy of the two places and there are many more historical and current pictures here in the infrequentPlus article.
Kerber with optical follow-up at China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledonier Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World Ranger Three is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhsten or the Spanish woman Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian set at number 13.
The Schwäbin now gets to do it with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the "Art and Enjoy" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach in the weekend.
With great ease registered organisers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the Special Vernissage "Windspiel Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Enjoy".
This opened its pforts in the 15th year.
A great visitor claim showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Houselord Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a main organiser and artist.
Somewhat surprising but he declared his retirement a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven young hands with good future perspectives.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have contributed to flyers.
Also this year, at the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is a 70-cent special letter brand designed by them, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betn", designed by Volker Hahn, can also be acquired for eight euros.
He was pleased with the high demand of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg for the musical reframe.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel Performance" formally challenges artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playing.
They are artworks of metal or ceramics, often equipped with color accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor is expecting on the right side of the "Happy Tree" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colourfully lighted, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hubs and 24 alu tubes as a soundpiece.
With the sun blowing through the bushwork in the background, the object works marvelously soothing and invites to stay.
From Eckental Barbara's washing neck, which prefers in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half a distance, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heaven Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his beautiful imagination of sound, cement, and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" to swallow through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition may be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albanians: singers celebrate 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albanians also made their distress at that time.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out partout that after the resolve of the church chor "Cäcilia" there should be no singing life in the city area.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinnbusch they lifted the MGV 68 Albanians out of baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanians singers.
For the anniversary, they had relived the foundation feast.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break first.
In time for the 50-year-old existence, the traditional festival was back there.
An elegant ball was asked for festive clothing before.
The guests were not sitting in seating rows like elsewhere in the "House of Meeting" but cosy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was said: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln moved the controllers and asked to the dance area.
Honestly, the singers of the MGV 68 Albanians themselves gave the voice.
Equal to the occasion, happy songs were spoken.
Almost set: "So a day, as beautiful as today."
Fitting to the exquisite reef juice that many had before themselves, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wein".
In touching on another cool drink, Humulus lupulus, which is the Latin term for "hopping".
Again sophisticated was the choir management of Richard Homann, one of the five who were then in the tin bush.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," said Holstige, "He has such a easy way, it's a master performance he performs." Moreover, this time, men did not just show themselves bedsome.
The lady's "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose stock includes mainly Evergreen from the 20s to the 60s.
Finally, there was still poetry.
Songs Theo Weber had sitted on the desk until three o'clock in the morning to create its own rims.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented well sounding poetry.
There was also a great Tombola.
It is intended to finance a visit to the children of the Albatros Youth Centre in the Allweather Zoo.

Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The upstairs march.
Three games, three victories - the USC Münster reserve under screen rule of Axel Büring is quite right in Liga three.
No trace of shy or fracques, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite well.
"It wasn't clear, but we have already left impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker engaged him immediately: "This is a defeat that we can live very well with.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
At the evening at a post-day birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game abbreviated.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a satisfaction ball.
"If they bring it to the target, such a game can be chicken," knows Büring from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routineed forces and brought the full exploitation into the goal.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
This doesn't break our neck.
I have seen quite good Volleyball in phase," Annacker did not hate the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the trip is going for the independents, after just three playdays, it seems not possible to see.
"For that it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The Third League has an incredibly good level.
It is not closely comparable with Regionalliga-Volleyball." In the fourth Liga, they do not want to turn their view down anyway.
If the West is not being polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
But a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven.
On Saturday, we'll go to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in food on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Tromship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she talks openly about the fact that the series could have been involved in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chefhostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went from board forever.
The series that let her become a star could be also responsible for her failure to marry Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a bag alone around the world, and many of my admired colleagues saw me at the height of my eyes," says Keller in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she was always "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but this changed with the "traumship".
Because now the journalists called only at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked this."
She thinks it is possible that her then man could have been very jealous, but "what many men also hated his talks about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried to be the only right for Hans of Borsody and he wanted to know my fears not to know my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've changed," as she continues.
She always felt that she wasn't good enough for him.
He saw in me a emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared frightened and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage with Thomas Hardner, Keller said yes once again, "though I was afraid that it could be wrong for another time."
On the day before the standing wedding, I was crying in the garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had love at that time, "like in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone too naive to love."
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZZ-Ressort Zürich, has taken the ZFF opening party this time.
Our folder is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the grey shine, in which a green carpet is tucked on the six-sixth place, bleachs it by fee.
But it's keeping film festival, there wants to sun more or less famous in the lightlight.
Thus, on this late Thursday night, he turns over the place to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean WC-Oase" shortly.
Thus, the public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrate their premiere at the festival: The needs facility in the parterre of a new pavilion is a lot of effort to stream a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it smells in the Lord's Oase for some reasons to heaven.
So out here, across on the other side of the street: charged guests, who have just enjoyed the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the movie, celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the three-stage shopping house.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all the earthballs are known to come from the works shown.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival, so that you don't have to go into announcement for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a tie around the feathers that have placed a good fee to him, and two bully doormasters really wave him in generously.
Inside, the charges are pressing, they dance far after midnight to live music or are pretended by DJ rhythms to which they yell each other, and wash down with cüpli exquisite pendants.
In the delicatessen shop in the souterrain, Easter is waiting for lubricating mouths, alongside the incomparable raw culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate well is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales formals full exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without large losses.
You must love this country for it!
The folder studys the shield at the wheel staircase: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the wheel staircase."
If it's two separate instructions, he's gone into the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly saved life.
In the household goods department at the upper floor, the poultry cocktail is a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, is not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has been wearing a brand for years, isn't here on the evening either.
However, between local prominence, cash table and kitchen articles, a face that appears known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It's probably not far from his main actors.
And really: Likewise, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost acting like a chorknabe, walks through the quantity.
It is not satisfied, it doesn't work, it's very well stolen.
Just for this restraint, like misunderstanding, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and Ex-Football Star Diego Maradona enjoy the victory of his team.
Argentina's football camp Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new homeland Mexico.
After a 2:0-winning club of Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old trainer danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia-Rythmen, as can be seen in a video already published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow-colored tricot, fired by the players.
On Saturday, the Mexican secondligist defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0.
After the game, Maradona called into a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old trains the Mexican Club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Association League 1: ASV Send to Last Minute Plate "Devastated on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball-legist ASV Sending, could hardly believe it: "So a bitter defeat." His protectors were "devastated on the ground" after the unhappy 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They hadn't played bad - like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst - over wide phases, the transmitters.
Only the beginning phase "we have totally sleeped," the ASV trainer was angry.
Soon the houselords with 8:1, even the early time that Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"Then suddenly a back went through the team," Bieletzki assembled the second quarter hour.
For a break, the residue was only two gates.
Above all, Shipping's Bester, Marius Hinze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from visitor view.
After 33 minutes David was equal to Ernst to 15:15, then the staffel changer almost carried through.
Four minutes before the sirene, the precursor was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intervene the Unparteiian in the event.
Bieletzki usually avoids seeking the debt of others.
But: The 120 seconds time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff took, "was a joke."
LIT had laughed well and met four more times until the end - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, back also standing well against seven men and thrown again and again on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now has to get a fucking victory," said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV-Tore: Hints (9), Ernst (6), Slagl (4), Kremmar (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pole (2).
Increase (1).
Bayern: Woman missed for 30 years - Police graves for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the deadly remains of the woman.
On Saturday, the forces buried up a street at MarxGreen.
To this end, the road coating and several layers were carried out below, as the police and public prosecutors communicated together.
According to new findings, the missing one may not have been buried far away from its then dwelling place.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
The detectives did not exclude a crime at that time.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court has worked together with the public prosecutors, after re-examination, intensively on the case.
Together with scientists of the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, the detectives encountered an insight under the road at Marxgreen by means of a soil radar.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials limited the position to a few meters.
The results of the burials should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letters, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equippe computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has missed his threatening call as head of the billions of companies.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervisor SEC imposed an extrajudicial dispute on misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost the permission to run stocknotated companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay every $20 million, and Musk also leaves the Chairman's office for three years, a position similar to the German Head of Supervisory Board.
He must remain the head of the board.
In the comparison, which must be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla did not admit misconduct.
The SEC had charged the world-known manager before the US Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also supports SpaceX space company, is the public face of the losses of electric car pioneers, which is now evaluated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk is not aware of any debt
Musk had explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written to his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that the funding was secured.
This would have rated Tesla at a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk rested: Tesla remains on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a foreign chairman, set up two independent board members and also set up a committee that monitors Musk's communication.

Afterwards, the club crew missed the compensation several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger clarified after a solo of Liverpool's Torjäger Mohamed Salah on the line (31.).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge resolved the reds with a sleezer in the angle.
After the worst season start since 1989, record champion Manchester United has been increasingly deepening into the crisis.
The team of the controversial trainer José Mourinho lost at West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven days only in the table middle field.
Pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions-League Match on Tuesday against the FC Valencia.
Bernd Leno, former liver-cuss tourkeeper, came to his first premier league operation after a injury of Petr Cech.
Before the Champions-League game at 1899 Hopenheim on Tuesday, Manchester City won through gates of Raheem Sterling (29.) and Sergio Agüero (65.) 2:0 against Brighton&Hove Albion.
Leroy Sané prepared the 1:0, Ilkay Gündogan did not use the new top rider.

Inquiries: 46 percent do not want Merkel as Chancellor until 2021
After the crossings of the past weeks, the GroKo is disposing several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overturned the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, AfD adds a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday Bundestagswahl, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only receive 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
This has now lost the majority of the major coalition of all major research institutions - except Allensbach - in the Sunday issue.
The government parties are at 43 to 45 per cent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
At the 2017 Bundestagswahl, they received 53.4 per cent together.
The bandwidth is also large for the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys, is the second strongest party, 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voice shares from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
However, the resistance for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also decreased significantly since the Federal Day election in 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only every second (50 percent) is the inquiry currently wishing that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal day election in three years, 41 percent are for a new choice.
Also, in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been significant popularity abuses for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should reconsider for the CDU Presidency in December.
47 percent are, according to Emnid, 44 per cent.
Therefore, 64 per cent of the Union's adherents do not want a candidate, 35 per cent.
Outhang at Aldi: Price decreased to love
Does Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no romantic learning stories anymore - he should talk to Aldi about pout meat.
Munich - In times of the digital "Fast Food Dating" by Tinder and Co. the supermarket as an academic place for the great love is almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced potion meat, boxershort snack on the Wühl table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a just swipe to the right.
The app Tinder is in reputation to be less a contact but rather a sleeve stock exchange.
We have awakened the test: how do women react, not long in the first message about the hot brei?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory Potenzial will have it when love luck precedes an out-the-eye-missing and-recovered plot.
If the type also reports to his worshiper under the e-mail address bio-putenmeat@gmx.de, then this sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi-Filial that she would wish to find her dreamer, with whom she has talked shortly about the "30 percent reduced bio-pound meat".
She deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood for her faith in the magic of analogy learning.
Picture Beck: 500 ceiling for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerischschule has participated in the action "Deckel gegen Polio - 500 Deckel für ein Leben ohne Kinderlamung".

The cause of polyomyelitis, the polyoviruses, can only be demolished by vaccination, as it is said in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for gods
Levercusen (dpa) - BVB Port Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus demanded an end of the public discussion on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And this is not good for us," said the friend of the giant after the 4:2 victory in liver kisses at the TV broadcaster Sky.

Football: District Liga: Researchers appearing by the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this young season, and Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wortkarg, the coach of the Football District Ligist VfL Wolbeck, left himself for the first time (inside) to mind the lack of performance willingness on the green.
All history.
Meanwhile, it's going around on the Brandhove Road again.
Taufrischer Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, only houch thin at the rise in the past season.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the appearance.
"We made the rooms tight and pressed the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch commended his boys and looked at each individual for the party to simply say "thanks" for so much opposition to the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him Luca Rehberg came - it went from the 4-4-2 almost naked over to a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his ex (17th), the interchanged Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
Almost would have repented when the SCA in Minute 41 took the same place as two times in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naber trees at risk in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his expertise.
After the break, the VfL frequently took over full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed hardly.
Schroer also came too late at a Thewes input after 58 minutes.
With the interchange of Mile's case, Fetsch of the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Oldenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free shot for the placelords 18 meters before the guesthouse.
The scolded man entered himself and demonstrated his danger with standards.
Westhues" Ding with the right sleeve hit the bottom left from the view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty more minutes, they're supposed to be fucking long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck fled the leather in the chamber in the 80th minute unhappy.
The arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately showed on the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive wolbeck in the final phase, before the gas in the 87th minute of 12 meters had the victory on the pussy.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
Only 8 per cent of the boards were female on September 1, as the report "The Power of the Monoculture" stated, which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will go by them," said the foundation business leader Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Britain or Sweden, pure male-occupied leaderships - with a few exceptions - are far out of mind.
The residue makes German competitors less diversified, innovative and future-oriented.
It is another business culture.
In addition, the small increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies was due only to positive impulses in the enterprises of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
Although, according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years of precursors - the proportion of women stagnated.
26 women recently worked in the boards.
"I'm sure that the Dax companies will recruit again in the next year consistent women - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to commit a self-interest commitment to increase the proportion of "zero percent" to date.
Another picture comes from the supervisory boards: On 1 September, the proportion of women was 30.5 per cent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"If there were equal numbers of women recruited annually for the boards, a percentage of 40 per cent had already been reached in 2023," says the report.
Some even make mice: luxury cards: Which manufacturer deserves mostly per car?
Best deserve Ferrari.
The Italians take with each sold Ferrari 280,000 euros and make 69,000 euros operating profits.
Large cars, great profit: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car among the precious providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do the luxury manufacturers use the car they sell?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made every selled car 69,000 Euro business gain - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, is only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in race with prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euro wins before interest and taxes EBIT.

An emergency car is very damaged next to a street.
A 27-year-old passenger has been fatally injured in the collision of the use vehicle with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - best to save human lives.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - At the collision of a emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn.
The taxi drivers, the emergency doctors and their drivers were severely injured, as the police told.

The also severely injured 29-year-old physician was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another note doctor called, however, tried to do this without success.
The three injured people were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonner State Prosecutor, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we are uncomfortable
After the blamable from the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
To West Ham United, ManU 1:3 is subject. The way of defeat is expected to be to be spoken.
Similarly, the scene was in the 74th minute in which the regenesed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford suspectedly brought the Red Devils back to the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the passport of Mark Nobel, all the defendants of Manchester remained standing, and lizzies Arnautovic all the time of the world to shoot the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of previously inadequate performance over far distances.
It is quite different at the Uniteds Rival Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos large competitors Pep Guardiola came to a hazardous 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team first broke the defense lock of the outsider.
Sergio Agüero provided after a good hour and a double pass with the formal gate shuttle for the safeguard of the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for the jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2-degradation in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
As with the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man at the Londonians.
The 27-year-old meeting in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only match of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the balance after 70 minutes.
Better made it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his sleezer.
So after the speeches were started with an unfamiliar balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be hit for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the cup, through the liga's remnant, the Blues Liverpool also fell from the table tip.
Like City, the two London City Clubs also celebrated Todtenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (at Watford) 2:0-winning.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played, had to patite against the surprising team from Hertfordshire toward a success message until the 81th minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defense Craig Cathcart browsed a hereinput of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil with his third season hit for the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory in succession of Watford, is newly located right behind the big rival Todtenham on Rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave upstairs wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained in the league at 2:0 against Southampton for the fifth time in the sequence and proved the 8th place.
VW core mark missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - officially no topic and yet generally: The Diesel Scandal and the rings for driving bans and re-enhancement should not be released by the German car companies at the Paris industry meeting.
At the 2018 automobile salon, they show their new news from the next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and refusal offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, should be an important issue at least behind the shiny scenes of the fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and include their first pure electrical models: The e-tron of the Ingol cities is supposed to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext by BMW is only to start 2021.
The new 3s are the focus in Paris.
Over 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to auto-concerns, motorcycle builders and numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair that celebrates its 120th birthday this year takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors arrived.
In the heavy earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands of people are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured people.
The island had been shocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second had the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, it has resulted in tremendous damage to matters.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered at the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the numbers of victims are still significantly higher.
The figures are only from Palu so far.
However, there are also many other municipalities - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
Approximately 150 bikes celebrate service in Werdöl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service of the motorcycle drivers in the Church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdahl - The place before the Church of Peace in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
In any case, the final gods service for the bikes was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the engine pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the mental care of the PS strong two-cycle drivers.
Between April and September always takes place on the last Sunday of a month of traditional motorcycle gods service (MoGo) at the house of Nordhelle.
The graduation of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikes gathered on Sunday to do anything else than regular worship.
Already from 10 p.m. the Bolides were set up before the church's entrance portal.
First, the biker frogs were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a deft curryworst.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian group of motorcycles from Gummersbach, were included.
The preach was held during the Biker-Gottesdienst of Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer Songwriter, Valerie Lill, provided the musical painting.
"Though the bikes prefer the Blues rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetic-called tons," said practitioner Frank Schröder.
This was certainly also a novum in the history of the motorcycle gods service yesterday.
Foodorfer Home Association celebrates a great festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also on the actual day of action, Borish was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple peanut cakes.
Great interest also embraced Georg Hartmann-Niemerg.
He had his apple press in the baggage and demonstrated his amazing viewers step by step the process from the mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the children the field, and let them fill the apples in the great triggers.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely cut mass.
I don't think many of the children could imagine how they should get a tasteful drink.
However, this important step could also be seen at this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and wrapped by networks, Georg Hartmann-Neemerg stacked the a little like cocktail pieces layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step was not so difficult.
The freshly-pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the fertiliser farmer had already completed specialities.
Thus, he opened his "saetbox" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "made in fertilizer" was similar.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built-up hipburg for themselves.
Also active of the Fuchtorfer companionship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited to some stations to play short-term games.
The home association will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, so stressed Gregor Krützkamp, the home in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season care: "Shutting situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga degradation, Trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professional of Hannover 96 around and couraged them.
However, there was a lot of positive things previously at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Intracht Frankfurt.
"It's a terrible situation, but you have to get out of here as a crew," said Pirmin Schwegler 96-Football Profi and pushed out: "This is naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further Sieglosen Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to connect, stands with two counts down the bottom and is a decline candidate in its current constitution.
On the other hand, declared by the superior Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB-pocalcier, which, after the successful general sample for the Europe-League game against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vice-Weltmeister Rebic was almost involved in any hazardous offensive action of the Hessen and never managed by Hannover's defense.
The storms, which were longly attacked after the WM, showed with its speed and enforcement ability why it is so valuable for enthusiasm.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began swingingly.
One of Lucas Torro's headballs (17th) was first endangered to the gateway.
Six minutes later Sébastien Haller was stopped in prospective position in the last moment from the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership of the houselords fell almost necessarily and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a curved corner in the penalty room, Haller extended by head before the gate, where Ndocka had only to keep the foot.
It was the first federal league for the defence player coming in the summer by the French branchist AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who was able to tank himself through and 96-torwart Michael Esser didn't have a chance.
During half the time, Hannover-Coach Wide Ritter responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Niedersachsen now played a little more courageously forward, the inflammatory ideas remained up to shortly before the end, though the connector still reached.
The heaters were much more efficient there.
After a tough hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed cross on De Guzmán, who had to move the ball to the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overrequired guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party miles
Cubes despite cool temperatures, there was good mood at the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter made it before millions of publics at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Crescent Festival on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The Festival Service takes place in the City Church, then is a procession to the Holy Crescent Church with the Final Sea.
The Holy Cress Church houses the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and is supposed to have shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
From the shot wound, then blood flows.
From this, a great wall trip developed to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Crescent Church.
This has not been built until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger parish, the service was badly visited.
After the service of God, the procession to the Holy Crescent Church took place and with the final view the church part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic church chor has then invited to the worldly part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with warm food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, Farmhofeis.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered leaderships around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seiger informed the visitors about the damage to Fassade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue to take place until the next year.
After a period of time, the damage could be more precisely detected and the individual tendering was more specifically prepared.
It is certain that renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damages already existed a few years ago have grown, but more has also been detected, which was only possible through the inauguration.
The soccer consumption work has been completed, before winter, it is intended to begin the natural stone work and one hopes to be able to complete the half of these work this year.
Introduction: New home in the New Ulmer Münster Viewstraße
Life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münster Viewstraße.
The fact that in the Münster View Street is now given "a very special house" of its destination - there were all presents agreed at the dedication date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have already lived in the home of the Danube-Iller living in the lives for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Larger walks, walks and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas have taken into account the architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was put on the test stand for the inhabitants with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in time in the equipment," said Bader backlooking.
In 2016, the baggers urged to cut off the house.
The new construction should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel well in it, says the architect.
Living Assistance Donau-Iller opened new home
About €4.6 million invested life aid in the new building.
The free state added 2.4 million euros, the Schwaben district EUR 450000.
The construction works have remained in the planned framework, according to architect Bader - timely and financially.
He was also thanked by the director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-safe construction had not always been easy.
Yet, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many regulations that allow the inhabitants to experience freedom to be able to move without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the particular needs of its inhabitants, which need help to be mobile."
The living and functionality have been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further, "The property in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer available in today's situation."
Overall, the new home in the Münster view street offers space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three groups of residential groups, nearly 1500 square meters.
Pride is life aid manager Heinz on the eleven full-time forces all employed by tariff.
Germany: Silence complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all people of the country not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot satisfy with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the "day mirror on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans were working in the average longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent would get less salary.
"I can explain this to nobody almost 30 years after the German Unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this poundy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one year Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang has made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moons office informed on Sunday, the two dogs, about one year old, reached their recipients already on Thursday.
Thus, they took place in Panmunjom with three kilograms of dog feeding to facilitate the animal's adventure.
The dogs with the thick white skin, spitting ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship issue had announced the north at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean power holder Kim Jong Un in the middle of September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions, such as the Olympic Games in 2020, and to apply together for the exhibition of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the test device Tongchang Ri for missile drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated nearly ten months since this Memorial year, numerous new books have been published, mostly answering this question over the past centuries.
It is quite different from that of Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Picture Book" Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - so is the inofficial motto for the today-starting working week of the Great Coalition.
Nearly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not ment the "return to work."
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, casinos and other employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote its duty to the government again, then it should not be stopped with conceptual debates now.
If the Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamages of the past weeks, it may already show on Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government parties meet the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call this round on a regular basis in order to clear up conflicts early; a doctrine from all the dispute.
Firstly, however, with the Diesel refugees and the law on migration of professionals, there are again conflicting issues on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums glimpsely escape, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty for technical re-establishment of older diesel.
While during the Diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on the migration of professionals during the weekend.
The SPD requires a stay perspective for rejected asylum applicants who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "proof change" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally and equally have joined GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Conflict is good.
Without dispute, a society of so many, sometimes contradictory interests does not lead forward.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be reconstructed for parteitative reasons for the question of His or nonsense.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and SPD are supposed to argue - but always have the reality of human life in mind.
What is possible and useful for many?
With this lead question, both the diesel and the trace change question can be pragmaticly cleared - and thus recover confidence.
In particular, the people's parties now have to fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hardinger
Minister in Vision
Does the Ministry of Labour compute against the current law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to see it more accurately.
"A real day and night" had worked on social security reform, a overwhelming social minister reported at the presentation of itself two weeks ago.
At list-pilz-Mandatenin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is awful - she now brings the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not at all to announce violations of existing service law before running cameras".
Yet, she now has questions to allow Har tinger to be "free from any suspect".
Police is looking for women like a street
MarxGreen - Lange did not want to express its opinion.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since the early Saturday morning on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is locked in the MarxGreen area until Monday.
The detectives had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with his guide, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters in multiple uses.
In addition, together with scientists at the University of Technology of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the area of the stated roadpiece, a soil anomalia was discovered.
For more than a year, State prosecution and Criminal Police Court has been dealing with the suspicion.
Once again, a cycling route was locked and investigated with solar devices at MarxGreen, because the detectives suspected that here, in the course of the new construction of the State Road, Heikes body could have been worsened 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalls in Barcelona before Catalonia Anniversary
On Monday, the controversial reference to independence in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's got crabs before.
Separators have not forgotten the police operation from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there were conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder in order to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and civil warranty.
Some 3,000 police officers of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in operation last year at the referendum classified as illegal in the elections.
In the attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations separated by the separatists and the central state security forces, reported Spanish media.
But some of the about 6,000 separatists would have tried to break through the police chain with violence, and the officials would have bought color bags and eggs among others.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 more had been easily injured, it was called upon the authorities.
On Monday, the first year is the reference to independence.
After the vote and a subsequent decision on the splitting of the wealthy region of Spain, the Central Government in Madrid Catalonia had put under force in autumn 2017.
Carles Puigdemont, former regional president, fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
However, several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections had been held in the region.
Following the office of the new Catalan government in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
However, the new regional president Quim Torra also relies on the "right of self-determining" of the Catalans.
Football: Upperliga Westfalen: Collected Ratlessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torless
Red-White Ahlen continues to go on.
Also at the FC Gütersloh it was only enough for a 0:0-decision.
The final light and the third last exposed them to 438 viewers in the Heidewald Stadium as gathered unfairness.
The first half was angry with the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who would prefer to get a beer or a bratwurst could do this unanimously.
There was no danger to miss a torchance, because there was practically no.
First shot after half an hour
Responsible for the first (harmless) flock shot of the entire party signed goodsslohs Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - opportunity had the Ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced out to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the criminal space border.
The hosts were even harmlesser.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged injuriously, for him, Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters, focused just over the cabinet and after an hour, the goodslohers also appeared for the first time openly.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it went well.
The rapidly presented account about Sinan Aygün "grand" Nick Flock (62.) with a loud shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a cornerball of Tim Manstein, ex-allener.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahleners did not.
Only in the 91th minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't bring anything in.
Angelo Daut strived to strike out the positive: "I like that we played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero was also at the front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were still against woodwickede and that, although our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlen's interim trainer found.
Offensive "was a little pleading" against a team, "who just wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel we could get a counter door," says Daut.
However, as a viewer, they did not feel like his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too necessarily for this.
Crown fields Harvest Thanks Market: Fortunately, there are enough creams
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are pleased by the Reckfelder table issue for which these donations are intended.
The honourable officials assure: "These donations remain in bill field."
At the opening, the heavens appeared brilliantly blue, but the space was still somewhat empty, but this should still change over the day.
For, "Here it is so nicely, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper prize Humor.
For the Brockmann couple, which was supposed to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer came in on a short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's plenty of creams.
And the "replacement" did not take it to entertain the more and more musical visitors.
This was so good that later, some people's songs were joined.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer was happy.
Mayor Peter Vendemeyer was able to spend the opening date this time in his schedule.
He rejoices over the many assets with their cities, including mainly associations.
"In fact there should not be something like a table," he thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek commended the use of all those in operation at the cities and also included the further festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful line - there's something going on.
Then the corkranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firearm and brought into the winter quarter.
In many cities, work was done for the physical welfare.
Everything was to have from sweet to heartfelt.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckfeld for a year, became creative in his decopiers.
Furnier work, beer cover with ranking fields motives and much more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three rank fields imker: "Reckfielder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth Buschlüter.
The latter has another speciality.
Honey cakes in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to get back there, so good the cake tasted.
The sociality is that the visitors then have stayed long to the evening hours, even without stage programs that do not exist at the autumn festival.
Smoking with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people have hardly encouraged the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are corresponding butterflies, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been instructed for injury.
In large letters, the three words "Shate Park for Lengerich" appeared on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the vocational election fair, a corresponding writing was discovered on 19 September on the advertising sign at the stairs of Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of the time seemed to have been left "only" with a Edding, they could be removed without problems.
"A few days later it was then back there, this time sprayed," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by calling on the table several large companies of Lengerich.
If the skate plant is built, it is also intended to allow the realisation of the skate plant by sponsors.
There are already promises, explained Jörg Hesselmann from the urban sector School, Sport and Culture, without name.
But well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the broken table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of Skate-Fabrication.
After the old one had been cut off at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after a while.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly for the fire defense parking.
However, this notion has not been implemented - too many factors seem to have spoken against a construction in this place.
At the end of June, a turn was followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It will take a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Close pass in flight security becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, German airlines do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes," said the Chief of the Air Traffic Society, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
One important reason for the numerous delays and delays in flights is the long-lasting staff need for European air navigation, for which there is no fast solution.
"The Airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unions.
In Europe, the market for fully trained lots was empty.
Alone in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace was missing about a hundred people.
Maas once again criticized that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, representatives of the federal, national, airline, and airports meet on Friday to deal with the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, this will not go without us," explained the GdF's head, who has many members in the German Air Force.
Maas once again made the EU Commission's requirements responsible for the lotsen mize.
Transport forecasts for the current regulatory period until 2019 had been far too low.
The costs and personal savings resulting from it in national airlines are now fully dependent on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Bundesverkehrsminister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to take action in Brussels for regulations that "not further cut off the air".
At present, EU standards would be voted by 2024 and there should be fear of further exacerbations.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have seen in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delay costs will lead to a change in the airlines.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "stimme training and future pact", said Maas.
The up to date announced recording of 120 lotsing schools annually over the next five years was just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary personnel construction is not yet linked to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board votes for group construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Chief Guido Churchhoff, who was appointed the Chairman of the Board on Sunday, the crisis group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and are noted at the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
There are ten representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a main meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG should include the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is intended to be combined with lifts and supply.
Barcelona: Violence with demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
In two contemporary demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona there have been violent conflicts with many injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered together on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 advocates of independence.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
However, according to the operating forces, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through security locking.
They would have attacked the officials with color and throwshots.
Rangeleien, according to the data, was also found between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better wages and evaluation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to honor the colleagues who had done almost a year ago against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish Central Government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they.
The demonstrators felt it was provoking that the Spanish police protested in Barcelona.
"Why have they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstration manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they had tricked us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearians, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the prosecution.
"Of course we want to support our companions who only did their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for implementing our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had come "not to provoke," assured the policeman.

Football: Juve trainer praises by top party: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese Star Storm was playing "the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia", commended Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) -winning the record champion against the SSC Naple.
For the trainer, the expensive star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allgri.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three gate models, Juve turned the game after the early resistance through the meeting of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and first depended on the worst persecutor.
First, the gate hunter picked up by Real Madrid gave up the former federal liga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the leadership with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also worked for the meeting of defense manager Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to put in the front of the gateline.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But, of course, Allgri wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record-tor shooter.
"We have to get better in serving him," asked the coach.
Best Juve Torskytter is now Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to become even more expressive.
Seven winners in seven games are the flawless series in Series A. At 21 points the master of the relapsing seven years already has six counts predominant on Naples.
The table range trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not chanceless against Turin.
But no later than after the spot reference of the already confused Mario Rui (58th) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to go hard to Paulo Dybala with yellow rot from the place.
"We played well against a good Naple," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has gone through with Juve.
The professional coming from FC Liverpool was in operation at all seven Liga parties.
The middle field actress also played in the Champions- League Party against Valencia, who said Allgri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the square at the 2:0 victory of the tourism and is locked for home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Canye West Changes his name
Rapper Kanye West gave attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" in the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided the spheres and questionnaires with the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change of name in time to publish his new album.
From now on, you can only call him "Yes", so the musician.
"The Being, which was formerly known as Kanye West," he twittered to the dead singer Prince when he left his artist name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
Already the tenth album appeared under that name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRRL, the artist explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Circular A1 Münster: Finally!
Finished!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no hole from his disappointment.
This was a weak game from us today.
The opponent was simply more strictly, we have never put him before problems." Consequently, the list of Hoetmarer deposit options reads thin.
Grade two torchances in 90 minutes, so only rare games can be positive.

The SG also had only two possibilities in the first round, but the first made use of Maik Krause from an angle to early leadership (7.).
In the 43th minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-working of Krause, he was putting free.
The hosts had only a double possibility as Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master in Jan Blome's postcut in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with the hand on the gate line and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stirred the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, that was different today than in the last few weeks," was the facility of Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Gates: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circular A2 Münster: spectacle football in Albania: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he ranked by words.
"We haven't got access to them." With which he probably meant the wing song with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites that felt with collective openness.
Yet he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, twisted freaky and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, was noted that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Noted, after a duel of two crews, one of which, namely Albanians, plays the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class content.
Understandably, with mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by distance our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we keep on one of the top crews of the Liga over the entire game time, that was really phenomenal."
So bitterly it seems that you now have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner brought the hosts in leadership with his 12th seasons (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he mustarded over the left side for Fabian Frohning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can't be stopped.
"That was crazy what it has done," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent unwillingly.
Shortly before the change of page, his elf made the compensation: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long toreck (45.).
After the change of page, it was McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
After that, it went somewhere.
It was a knocky, action-loaded game.
Nübel once again shocked Albanians (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was like it (69th).
Despite a large number, Albersloh was no longer able to reconvert the last Concordia meeting (80th).
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Shapedatter, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Frohning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow Rot: Atalan (74./Albachten).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Gospel Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-night next year.
Derweil has signaled France's President Emmanuel Macron to get the tolerance price in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: he was not in Tutzing's Gospel Academy as Federal President.
But before and later Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, the academy director Udo Hahn acknowledged him as he proudly said: "All the federal presidents and Chancellor were already with us." That the Academy in the castle of Tutzing has always been a subject when presenting the annual programme.
At the end of October, songmacher Constantine Wecker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron also agreed: He wants to receive the "tolerance prize" given to him in Tutzing, which also receives TV moderner Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is not safe!" says in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - so the academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without a limit."
Waffle deals, destruction, torture, death - war prevents any human idea."
From structural racism in society over the scissors between poor and empire to radical change in work by digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy director Hahn convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting for 200.

Music cabarett: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
"Both for adults and men" was the musical cabal with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ's Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner's gender understanding took place, not only with humor and heartwarmness for the (feeled) woman and the (feeled) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set it in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben Süverkrüp.
It is one of the male sparing partners, sometimes even to the end of the sentence, one of the true pianists: So kingly accompanying the sorcrown Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, namely, as it suited to the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had brought into the game a paradoxon: the satisfaction with a man, if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano-Solo now demonstrates itself: What would have come from composing Mozarts, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unfortunately?
Thus Sükrip glides over in improvisations, from Bachs "O Head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death" and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a played dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers conveyed Karlheinz Klein, the master of the association, the Chansonette.
However, the chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck was not able to take additional thanks.
She had the idea that Duo should also be one in Wolbeck next to the shows in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

"I was really satisfied with the defence, only one player has made too many gates.
We haven't handled them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more anxious about the many missed chances.
The concentration at the end made his team miss this time.
As a result, the ASG ran almost to the end of a remnant, lay behind with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only at the end, the broader bank of the hosts made a decisive notice.
Aydogdu also put back space Merle Klement on the left outside, which then "extremely cleverly made the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).

"This was a giant step for a cool season.

The first passage almost dominated the guests according to popularity.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the masters of the year before.
Food has been accepted in the two-bar, but hasn't come into the game.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent has put high risks, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "The adoption has changed to three-line.
We couldn't keep the pressure.
Food has sucked, and we've got a little bit sucked," continues Münch.

Although East Bevern was defending at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.

Münch: "We played consistently and quietly there."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passage brought four with 25:22 on their side.

International: Turkish municipality: Moschee opening as a missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Moschee was imposed in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The Moschee Opening in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a cluster that can only be toughly reversed," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's redaction network.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, reconciliable appearance.
"According with German top politicians to underline the association of Muslims with Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," complained Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "encouraged many reservations".

Almost on the day exactly then it's a year ago that we've been doing a people's match for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a solid part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Notulner Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our people's event would be so fast in Nottuln eta.

"The program at the next race is like always a colorful mixture of German people-, hiking- and sailor songs, Folksongs, Evergreens and old slaughters," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends musicians to Nottuln.

From pure fruit cultivation to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Garden Building and National Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulse was set for the Circuit for Garden Building and Landpflege Kulmbach, and precisely 125 years later, he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbacher City Hall on Saturday evening.
In 1893, Mayor Wilhelm Flessa lifted him from baptism.
The purpose of the fruit plant also differed from today's work - it was actually about the fruit construction, about flowers and garden construction didn't even think of anyone at that time.
"In that time, in the epoch of the education, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said circuit nurse Günter Dippold in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should be seaming remote roads, in schools so-called industrial gardens.
Obst Building is still the task of the 55 Garden Building Associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprises nearly 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A natural garden construction, biological plant protection, village decoration and diet plays a similar role as providing knowledge, healthy diet and youth work.
The multitude of the tasks of a garden construction unit, the members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Mulwurfe" showed entertainment at the stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary especially in the digital era," said the circuit chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The cathedral collection was a huge cause for us children, I doubt that you can collect much joy with smartphone & co. similarly.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the Circle Association decides," supplemented Landrat Söllner and highlighted the particular importance of the garden construction associations for the villages.
The circular association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green surfaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern for many gardens associations in the rural area, also made no doubt to circuit business leaders and experts Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the circuit association, including reporting the need for self-care after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, it was shot in for winter.
In the late 1950s, however, the garden has turned into a garden of decoration and housing.
"The nature has stood, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, for the garden building associations, there is the incentive to not let down so that our home is beautiful and lifeworthy.
It also includes greeting the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline of insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful festival that was celebrated by the tower bladders of the music association Thurnau.

Mexico's government wants clarity in Nafta: they make both trading partners an Ultimate for an agreement.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured by a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report in the "O Globo" newspaper.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take place publicly in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician had been attacked on open road at the beginning of September during an electoral event in Southern Brazil.

In the capital of Brazil, the protests were mixed with an announcement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of Ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to announce.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
Haddad was a former mayor of the million city of São Paulo in research so far far behind the right-extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" has long been mixed with in politics, but newly present itself as an anti-system candidate.
If no candidate reaches the absolute majority in the first election round, there is a sample on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not succeed from this - no matter who he comes to.
Bolsonaro is known that he has been hoping against homosexuals and blacks and glorified the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He always shocks with verbal discharges.
Another time he said that the attendants of Lulas left worker party should be shot.

He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt at night" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark until today.
On Sunday, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honored Larsen in a statement as "strasse boys", which was "with all things but in all the hearts".
Moreover, the Head of Government reminded that the Monarchy opponent Larsen 2010 had occurred on the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at press air hammer level
"We stand here, take the bone saws and light a concert with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" put such a description of the rocky live musical experience on Saturday night in the hall of the Civil Centre Shoe factory: Hardrock purely from three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surroundings - all in connection with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loud stable, the approx. 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night are visible.
Already the "Tiger Bonesaw" quarter with frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince on the moment of concerting even with the latest, unknown pieces of own feathers and the next appearing CD.
In front of the stage, it is danced to play the band's void and printing.
Although "addition" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the trio "Here We Stand" the stage.
The fact that hard rock is not the same as hard rock shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and carpenter Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes on classic rock in the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" the "Here We Stand" also comes to the guitar rock.
Not only the desired, just too balladenous "Take Me Home" depicts by changing melodic passages to the guitar loady rock riffs of the multilayered songs.
However, the "The Ignition" Quartet has played a special degree of familiarity since its foundation in 2005.
The band presents its hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its appearances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tournament in China in 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and inevitable.
Songs and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays with the band at the only coverted song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 1980s, completely own accents.
At the same time, Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann provides a rejoiced solo, running through the audience, to feel even more exposed sound than before.
A certain volume belongs to a genre with such a hardrock concert: The "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the Mixpult team, is at the threeer concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" at about 98 Decibel.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is still clearly under the executives of the "Wacken-Feitval", which "The Ignition" refers to on their website.
Ear debilitating 120 decibels in diving volumes, as used by the annual metal deck in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener's audience does not need this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang type have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the sows of the bone and concerted with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

The pilot died in the accident.

Trump heaves Kim: "And then we have loved"
The fact that the US President of North Korea, despite the nuclear crisis, has been well-defined, is not a mystery.
Now, however, Trump made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married U.S. president has known for a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
In the public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Before adherents in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half so old sprout of the Pjöngjang ruler dynasty, although in the rings around North Korea's nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tearsome fractures.
"I was hard, he too, and between us it went from time to time," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also had political fruits: Trump pointed to the stop of all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics have not seen much more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the known "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - not to be any more memory, seemed to be aware of the U.S. president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so inpresidial.
But he cares very little about this, declared Trump and then directed his point finger to the crowd: "I have always said to you that it is so simple to be present."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this filled arena, but we had only 200 people outside.
Octoberfest locks many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler's best visits, atmosphere as well as above addicted by sun satisfied: Very varied and with a good shot of October festflair, Baesweiler's city was poured out on Sunday.

Restored from Libyan prison for refugees thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous prison conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video, allowing their salvation.
In July, the group had turned the recording into their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in danger of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Migration Organisation (IOM).
The refugees were finally fleeted to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had taken the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in attempting to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in life risk, according to his own statement.
One of his contestants was almost killed by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of arrest had been disastrous: "They all hit us with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat. We had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary retirement of refugees who are struck in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home this year using the program, said the IOM speaker in the Western African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad prison conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a help call by phone video until now.
International organisations have long been criticizing the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated to large parts of military, is the main country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Germans had been captured in their own car for days

Laschet admonishes the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) urged the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in its own statements, to state of law in Turkey.
The relationships of the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne Airport.
This concerns mainly the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear in Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that legal status is a very important requirement for it.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Ardogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a building of the Airlines of the Federal Defence Ministry at the Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place on Wahn Castle - but the castle owners had rejected that from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to open the Ditib Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the construction.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the United States: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump does not get tired to emphasise the successes of the negotiations on denuclearisation of North Korea, the ostasian regime represents the conditions of nobles.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri calls for a meeting of Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has instructed the US Government at the UN General debate to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean penalty island with its existing sanctions.
"The recent stop is therefore that the United States is based on forced measures that are fatal for the formation of trust," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we can unwave ourselves as the first one," the North Korean Chief Diplomat Executed.
That criminal actions could force North Korea on the knees is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped his nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test, Ri emphasized.
However, from the U.S. page there were no "responsive reactions", the Minister criticized.
Due to the North Korean Atomic and Raketing Programme, the UN Security Council had adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country alone last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo urged the United Nations in recent days to follow the penalties strictly.
At the same time, the US Government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met the dominant Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
After the first summit in Singapore, the president of the United States is attending a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to travel again to Pjöngjang for discussions about the end of the North Korean nuclear program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were in a youth event, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White ceiling and flower jewelry on the tables and a great buffet waited for the guests after the Harvest Thanksgiving Service.
The HoT young people had magicated the buffet with deliciousness from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality for which the young people wanted to thank with food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembered.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, the first day after the summer break, the evil surprise came: an electrical decay had disposed of the huge, secondary refrigerator, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we had a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and youths wanted to make it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Beter it can't be made," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido cubic soup was served or the guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and youths put on their legs," emphasized practitioner Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan lammers with card tricks and other pieces of art made surprising.
Jürgen Sator leaves NRW of the table
From frustration about criticism from its own rows, the head of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, has issued his posts in the National Association.
Sartor had become known all the way because the Essener table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already retired as Vice-Chair of the NRW tables in July, said Sartor of the World on Sunday.
I've fallen too many in my back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, spoke to the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-term alternate alternate representative.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can follow his step - there people have expressed themselves who didn't know exactly why the food table is doing this."
Sartor is still active for the food table - "six days the week, there's nothing going on," says Weilersweiß.
Sartor again criticized criticism to colleagues of other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You can't follow the approach, "without us, the people in the city are hungry."
It should be the responsibility of the State to ensure that people don't hungry.
At a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not participate.
"There's been told me too much sweet shoe," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me at that time.
SF Lorch play 2:0-run - Gmünder Day Post
Football, District Liga Lorch lost against Neuler 2:3 - TV Houchlingen victory in Kirchheim for rest - Bettringen strikes laughheim clear.

Gladbach plays two-time leadership - Schalke without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an external victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the fools play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz to the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvred in the first five league games with early countertors to the absence.
Now the Domenico Tedesco team returned the strength on the day with which it had proved the first place behind the Bayers in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf brought the homeequipe in the eleventh minute after a strong pre-working of Jewgeni Konopljanka by head, as a result, the hosts preserved the Minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund grew new from the top of the Federal Liga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0:2-rescue against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but in the second half of the time, it was still 4:2-winning.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compare with a double bed in the inner four minutes, Paco Alcacer, exchanged by Favre in the 63th minute, with another double in the final phase (86./94.) provided the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart came to the first victory.
Against the yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic before the break, the Stuttgarters had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unnoticed Goalie Ron-Robert targets factored a curiosous envoy, which helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher with the Swiss quarteret Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a two-time lead from the hand, finally played 2:2 and still waiting for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1 with his second federal leader.
At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann was powerless summer, as well as the second match after an hour.
Yet, the trends at Gladbach are quite heated.
Alassane Pléa appears in the storm of the fools as a goal goat.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase coming from OGC Nice met for the third time in sequence and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach takes the fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously inflicted Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart manoeuvred into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart account that the Ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with its first seasonal match, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe was in charge of a tricot surgeon against Daniel Didavi Gelb-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defendant Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert targets brought the Bremer back to the game by a curious encast owner (68.), a quarter hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot back the surrounded Stuttgarter to the victory street.
Nürnberg decided the Duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team through Foulpenalty on course.
Macedonian vote on new state names
Today, in Macedonia, some 1.8 million citizens vote on whether the name of their country is to be changed to Northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades of swelling conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be solved.
Due to its name, the northern province of Athens had been insisting on a change in name and blocked any approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become rapidly NATO member in a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-year-old friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two gave themselves the yesword in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had said before the "Photo" destruction.
"If we marry, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a household policy speaker of the SPD Friday fraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD flour.
In the Bundestagsdebate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had been excited with an angry speech on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had proposed for Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "pushed" in the topic.
"This was your shabowski motive," he pointed to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, equal sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters ceiling cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Civil Association Children's House and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of ceiling around the gardens of the inhabitants of the pepper house should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce the costs," explained the Chairman of the Walter Schröer Civil Association.
And there have been so many things.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately, it's just a form.
Because already in the spring, it has been shaved once.
The following breakfast at work has also a long tradition.
"It's all supposed to stay at power," said Walter Schröer.

The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal to conclude the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old placed a perfect race on Sunday on the Olympia Street.

Pleite bei Hertha: Collected from the reality: Bayern against Ajax demanded
The predicate is unbelievable: the defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "not fall".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate facility for the time of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance part of the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to the larger autumn depth for the Munks.
"A week ago, you had the impression that we are indefeated.
Now we got a little reality," Thomas Müller found after the deserved 0:2-degradation at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction to the Champions-League-Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us, he knows that we are right upset and that's why we're giving us gas on Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year outside, no own gate shot, as at the same time of the pre-season, two compulsory games in series without victory, lost the table management in the football liga first to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failure of Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-anti-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle sticks across the outside have delivered two blues within three days, as the last excessive bayers are to knock.
"They who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we will do everything so that we can be successful again," stressed Kovac.
Otherwise, he went gentlely around with his losers in his city of birth and pushed his first defeat as Munch Coach only on the once again lacking dealing with chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, before the country game break, would still have a positive effect on the first intermediate facility of his term of office - otherwise, the sound would probably be sharpening.
So Kovac did not take extraordinary measures before the second king-class occurrence of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which was also solemn to AEK Athens at the start with 3:0.
"Now it's taken us in two games, but we're going to make our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost pokalfinale against entrance Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich spoke mainly Klarxt.
The legal defendant acted as a measurer.
"I don't think that this is all a pech, we have to work it up again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous playtime, the Bayers were even with five counts behind Dortmund, which now took the tip again with a point in advance.
And so Kimmich valued at least positively with an eyetwinker that now the public debate on the supposedly insultable Bayers has ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's been good for the Liga.
DFB-Boss in shot line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attacks of Erdogan on Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan proclaims exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes but defends the link line.
Now we want to create a new post.
Berlin - At different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the definitions of the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President of the State to open the big Ditib Moschee in Cologne strongly criticized the dealing with the former world champion in Germany, the DFB-Chef defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, the grindel attacked by Özil personally announced the consequences of the "Sportstudio" in the Mainzer ZDF from the Causa.
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration background in the U teams - that such a thing is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan is not for the values of football and the DFB.
He had insisted with sharp words on racism to Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they were taking photographs with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the city of Dom.
Honestly, I could not disappear as her President that our two young men who have risen up to the German national team have been excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonablely treated by the DFB" after the WM affair, which was taken by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to stand before players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I am a German, if I lose, I am migrant - that's not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for the return of Özil to the national team.
In addition to the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, are now to be called an additional integration representative.
"If one without a migration background clearly influences society and football and says, "The topic is important, there we need to take care," that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our associations in the place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil affair, he wants to reconsider for the office as DFB president in the next year.
"I do my work and try to make her as good as it is," said Grindel.
Years build three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the Red Ampel in the area of Lauter Height.

The damage is about EUR 1300.

Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the capital church of St. Katharine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for everyone, the politician married his long-year-old friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the entry into force of marriage for everyone, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-year-old friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two gave themselves the yesword in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had said before the "Photo" destruction.
If we get married, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a household policy speaker of the SPD Friday fraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD flour.
In the Bundestagsdebate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had been excited with an angry speech on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had proposed for Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "pushed" in the topic.
"This was your shabowski motive," he pointed to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, equal sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the law of adoption.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the voluntary referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has started.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are supposed to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This consists because of its similar northern province of neighbouring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked every approach of Skopje to the EU and the Nato.
If the citizens agree with yes, they will also give the start shot for the West integration of their country.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and discharge members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with express consent, stresses Swiss transplantation.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and to discharge family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in death can be registered there.
Their wishes are then available in the event of Swiss transplantation.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken with express consent, as in Germany, underlines Swiss transplantation.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor ID, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a map will be found at the decisive moment of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, family members do not know the desire of the dead.
"You then have to decide as a vice-president in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible institutional donations on the hospital card, as the speaker of the Federal Center for Health Information says Marita Völker-Albert.
"There is no register in which people can register their wishes - per or versus organ donations -," she says.
Federal Minister for Health, Jens Spahn, has pronounced a new regulation of the institutional donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as an institutional donor unless he or his family contradicts.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old students are world champion in head calculator
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head calculator.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 contestants.
Martina Flamme Jasper informed the science museum Phaeno, the exhibition site of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greeting from Germany was a third place.
The latest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest of a 74-year-old retirement pensionist from France, as head scheiding judge Ralf Laue said.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants from the audience arrived with pocket calculators against guests.
Wenzel Greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air during the bill.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
Totally 82 candidates from over 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greeting was already two years ago as 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With concepts such as super brain, genius or miracle child, organisers can little start Laue.
"Could calculating can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even calculating competitions oriented in stages.
For example, the square root draw of six digits includes the disciplines.
In calculating versatility, the candidates receive surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because there are more intense and effective methods learned in early childhood.

Polare cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polare Cold Air reaches Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) the snowfall limit falls at the beginning of the week to 1500 to 1200 meters - in tight valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Tauers, above 2,000 meters are expected to be 20 to 40 cm of new snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsee, Bielerhöhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertouren, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winterly.
Farmers may start with the annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may start on Monday with the annual knick care.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have been the landscape of the waldarm federal country for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide trees and slopes are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last relocation rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered living spaces that can still work through the exchange of organisms, as the manager of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living toes
The Knicks were set up on the basis of a command by the Danish King Christian VI. in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living toes" were not only field limitation and bovine tuna, they also delivered the farmers burnwood and bars for their workhouses.
From that time his name was also "Knick": by "cracking" the axles, the thick, flooded delimitations could develop.
Today, between the North Sea and the East Sea ranges about 45,000 kilometers from the hills and gives the picture of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7,000 animal species as a reserve space.
In one kilometer Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breast up to 30 bird couples.
However, his ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he carries a light tree series, which, besides the variety of species, adds to the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, it is only allowed to operate outside the breakdown period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia talks about local situation
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami in interview with the editorial Network Germany (RND):
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the tsunami, I made myself on the way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation now on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid products can be fled in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also placed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are run on surrounding hills where they still endure out of fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stop in front of their homes, there are still afterwhelms.
Because many food shops and also the tank stations are completely closed, people are partially stealing food and petrol.
The public service has gone completely down, the national government is helping.
Also a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are partially running free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile receivers, but it didn't work before and we got information only via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people, who they do not know whether they live and where they stay, because people were on their way at work, not at home during earthquakes.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have information about it?
We don't know the reasons for it, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they are run to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI survey in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled hearings is very limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the shock thin majority for the judges who are controversial about the needy claims Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set an investigator a deadline until Friday to clarify the more than 30 years of suspected events.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's call accompanied by a cultural fight had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer exposed angry tirads against oppositional democracies, the Senate Legal Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Erzconservative Judge at the Supreme US Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his initial announcement that he would agree, but demands a FBI investigation.
His partyfriends were willing to come up with a stumbling scene.
President Trump, who had still referred to the heavy talks on Thursday as "decision", first had further attacks against the women and spoke, in contrast, of "happiness in the accident".
In this way, he said, the last doubt could be removed.
Later, Trump attacked the democratics sharply in an electoral environment because they refused Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The ease on Schalke is large after the first seasonal victory.
Yet, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - Today is known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This wasn't different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the royal blue was still able to bring the nearly 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over the time and thus the first seasonal victory under roof and professional.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Crew 11 of the team of Chieftrainer Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In total, the first half-time was good, both playful and from pressing.", with increasing duration of playing, the head seemed to play a role.
Actually, don't create a headball hobby.
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours," said Heidel, "If the crew was only half as nervous as I am on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said the creature, who had no immense share with his headball event: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
But at the end only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressurefully in the beginning phase and make a firework of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the crew and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageously, so we have to go to games over 90 minutes
The largest manko of the afternoon: the king's blue failed to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, such as through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a trembling," said Tedesco, "you have felt the fear a bit."
That's why I'm glad we've won.
He wasn't the only scalker.
Fishbachau: Smoking pillar in the main shaftal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at eye height
The author, Dr. Aladin El-Maphalani, stands before them.
He was repeatedly followed by the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have been the task of getting interesting people to graves for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckfelder Meeting" - the association that cooperates in the orientation of the evening with the 'Cultural Policy' alliance.
El-Maphalani is getting very loose in reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaking about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandably.
With a lot of geisty, hand-fast numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses to answer the question of a metaphor.
At a table, the German society is sitting, the migrants of the first generation are at the catentic.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to come to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the large table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore crucial not whether you are politically aligned with the right or the left, but, "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
In the beginning, more and more and more, the discussions are going to take place.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, tells two teachers how they see successful or not successful integration in students.
El-Maphalani stands, not on the stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is in the height of the eyes.
Sociology professor does not urge his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate halls.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "onst when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Maphalani.
Even during the following signature hour, he had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, in intensive discussion with prepared Kurdish specialities.

Thus Schalkes Naldo "Great Sport" succeeds on the bank
For the third time, Naldo is not in the start-up elf, but thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in sequence, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters of Brazil had spoken the fruit of the soul.
But after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the middle circle, when the chief trainer Domenico Tedesco grew up with all his professionals, the 36-year-old, all simplely called Naldo, joined and said: "We have to thank you, trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," said Tedesco later about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his reservative, had no grief.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated in the past season as the best scalker, knows that he has actually not been hit by his trainer - but is given a break for good reasons.
One reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you very honestly," said Tedesco about the moment he had told Naldo that he wasn't in the first elevator.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it is always about the matter, it's about the association," explained Tedesco the step.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can now get through.
And that we all keep in the boat," explained Tedesco the rotation that last took Naldo.
And the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself in the bank as an exemplary team player.
The mood in Austria's industry has accelerated its valley journey in August compared to the euro area.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
In all Europe, Austria still has the third best vote behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute informed on Monday about its survey among 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI of the euro zone grew by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still under the 13th month following the brand of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold with 50,9 points in August.
Final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the radiation barometer decreased, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index met 44.0 points has reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened valley journey could mean that the worst was over," said Markit Economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry - in the third quarter - remains growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export contracts in the euro area did not fall as strong as since November 2011.
Thus, the companies restructured the seventh month in order.
Also in China, industrial production decreased more than initially in August.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
At first, experts had expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices.
