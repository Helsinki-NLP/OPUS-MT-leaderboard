Food debt on European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the explosion was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were estimated from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British and Canadian Notenbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the heads of the European Central Bank (ECB). The reduction in interest rates would favour the rising raw material prices and the slightly decrease in unemployment in the form of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is seeking to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent market.
According to an analytist, the ECB is in the mill: inflation needs to be "consulted" in order to exclude subsequent needs of action.
In November, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record height in Germany with 3.3 per cent; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The rise in food and energy prices are responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat notations increased by 88 per cent, and the course for soya beans also reached a record high since 1973.
Food oil and milk products also had a significant expansion in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil increased this year by 52 per cent - last month the price per phase of the black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to decrease to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analytists estimate a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect that the ECB will reduce interest twice.
Gallup Place Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathisants has grown significantly until early December. First since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the consent for socialists, according to Gallup, has reached a never-existing depth of 13 percent.
The difference with the opposition advocates is clear in the partial voters: more than two thirds (71 per cent) are counter to one fifth (20 per cent) consent for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are, according to the survey, under the parliamentary court: they are two percent in the total population.
The number of party choosers has grown by one percent in both camps.
In comparison with the last depth, the general economic atmosphere has continued to decline - never before, the proportion of those who assess the economic situation of the country as "excellently bad" has been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent think it is "reasonably bad".
After hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is the result of a improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - assessed the work of the Prime Minister as "more bad than right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of the supporters for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the Head of Government at all, compared to 27% distrust against the party chief of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who think that the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister could be handled without any change in government.
After the disturbances in October last year, 35% of the government and the Head of Government said that it was still only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asking for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent answered that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would vote "probably".
In comparison, Parliament's elections would take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would "with certainty" go to the Urns, another 15% would believe their participation as "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be seen.
74% would vote against study fees, 79% against practice fee, and 84% against hospital day fees.
On the group of people participating in the referendum "with certainty" the shares of the opponents of study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84 or 89 per cent.
Evenan the expensivest, Tesco elevated by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained the average price increase of 16% of the last year this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the "Napi"'s usual Christmas corps has also increased by 16 per cent this year, but prices have been recorded in all hypermarkets from more than 1,000 HUF.
After the prices in the food markets have been "drawn out" in December last year, the depreciation has not been drastic compared to the high, earlier baseline level.
However, it will certainly disturb consumers that what they had paid for last year far below 9.000 HUF is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magic 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at the previous level, but the prices for puten brushfilets, nuss and moun are strongly increased.
Prices for flour and bread matched the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg bread wakes for 139 Forint at Auchan.
There was no competition-related price crash to under 200 Forint in the product.
Similarly, the price of a two litres Coca-Cola bottle of under 200 Forint was surprising, so the drink including Pfand only cost 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year, in the "Napi" cart comparison alsoan most expensive, and Cora the most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 per cent each.
The difference between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest cart of last year and the expensivest of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT in prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
This is precisely what has been the case with trade: it seems that the houses of goods have not just been able to decide which price margin they should apply in each article, since the impact of price increases on consumer behaviour was indefinite.
(If the dealer plans the circulation rate of a product badly, he may fall with substantial profits in the price range that is based on the transport intensity.)
Measure tax-conditioned the expense of the "Napi" cart last year was so radical that the expensive cart exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed because the most expensive basket cost by 1.630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a disastrous rise in price, the price of daily consumption products in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 per cent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foods, the Statistical Office found a more than 30% expensive period of 12 months.
So in approximately flour, also in eggs.)
However, if one looks into the "Napi" cart, this seems almost impossible at last, since the price level of the expensive product even in the worst case has increased by less than 10 percent.
It is obvious that dairy suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - in any case they were able to devour the drastic rise in prices to the multis.
In the golden triangle of trade, the hyper markets do not complain; it is reported in good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores are no longer looking at prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods go over the shop tables in palettes.
Wednesday morning morning morning, there were endless snakes at the cassa in all three stores when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many sites are stored on disinfectants
Hews were registered in hospitals more than a thousand infections that were due to inadequate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in the hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of the staff - all factors that are not precisely compatible with the prevention of infections, says the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
Many places are also saved in the disinfectants.
In the Janos Hospital's Traumatology Department, a MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injury of a severe auto accident was released from the hospital, but a little later, the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has not been carried out since then because of the bacteria still in the patient's body.
By 10 December of this year, infections caused by multiresistant agents were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers should be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carries about one third of the people in their nose, without causeing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, male inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wound) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the funds are excessively dosed or used uncommonly, the bacteria responding antibiotic resistant, which are rapidly spreading in the hospitals under the appropriate conditions.
Particularly in patients with weak, or permanently poor immune system, but also in elderly patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the doctor's head of the Janos Hospital, the MRSA infection is not special, such events are part of the hospital everyday.
If you can't confuse the infection with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA was admonished, there's only nowhere it is not searched.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the nursing personnel is carrying rubber gloves and masks in supply, and we have the necessary antibiotics for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are investigated on MRSA when they are transmitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable to prevent the development or spread of the multiresistant agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and age homes, spirals should examine the patients supplied and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals microbiological sample withdrawal is not so frequently practiced.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the sides of the State Disease Office.
Thus, most cases would not be evident until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the physician head of the Epidemiology Center.
On the side of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives for the treatment of certain infections and pictures of disease in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapy is supposed to be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to avoid resistance to the medicine, but these directives are not always complied with by hospitals.
Ambulant patients, or patients in primary supply, are even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Saved in the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to another most frequently by nursing staff.
This is why the washing of hands, or wearing gloves and masks is important, but there are also considerable shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drop-infection or contact, but in local hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patients.
The rooms are even often overfilled, the beds are hardly reaching each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues, it seems unfortunately in the less financially well-added hospitals even that there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that just favour the development of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the inducer can be stopped where these protective measures are respected, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To handle MRSA infections causes the health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their impression in the government programme, was established.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data proves, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decline.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the development of multiresistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Death-leans-polytics were not drunk
In the case of a car accident caused by the police head of the XXII district with fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
The now retired police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Boedapest Supreme Prosecutor on Friday after the official opinion was submitted in the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not used alcohol before he was driving.
The former police officer booked with his own car in the XXII. district into the Kossuth Lajos Street and traveled over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road on an unsigned place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milder condition - the driver has, even if pedestrians do not cross the street at the sebra strip, rearrangement.)
The pedestrian has been injured after he has been instructed to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then returned his functions and asked for retirement.
The Boedapest State Prosecutor has initiated its investigations for an incident.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police officer had cooperated with the researchers from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements in Budapest on Friday at a total value of EUR 400 million, which are intended to flow in education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy industry.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to be used on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will flow mainly in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has disclosed the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to Janos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects at a total value of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loans are made available by the EIB with an outset of 8 years, without provision.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradises of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is marvelous - the whole of Europe is watching the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the cheapest market in the EU, which becomes fastly expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most desirable plant for real estate sales in the Eastern European area, with favourable ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular regions, Albena, the Gold Coast, the Sun Coast, and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly demanded.
According to Re/Max Analytics in Bulgaria, the national investors also attended earlier or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russia records more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers exciting offers - Trade and office areas offer the highest yields.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists alongside the summer and winter season in the other two seasons.
Consequently, predicting investors already buy in large style, for example around Bansko.
Analytics say that people who acquire property in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, either buy re-vitalized real estate by 50-10,000 euros, or downcoming houses by 5-15.000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a large city, businesses and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is businessmen who invest in a medium- to long-term value increase.
However, real estate in the capital becomes more expensive, as a result of the ever growing demand.
In the EU, property prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been an increase in prices of 21 per cent annually.
The expenses at the real estate prices are far greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries consult on Bali's driving plan, in which emission reduction measures are established for the time after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a vigorous debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
A agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The Adjustment Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-headed Council, expected to be read in the United Nations Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
On behalf of Hungary, Environmental Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its preliminary role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (as measured by 1990 values), regardless of whether the "Community after 2012" was successful or not.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already committed a minus of 8% with its 15 Member States at that time.
The standard for Hungary is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared with the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will meet as it is read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The efforts are high on Bali - nevertheless, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would take effect only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, whose importance is also the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee, which is excellent with the peace nobel price of the UNO, in its recent report.
This would delay emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be unavoidable, according to scientists, which would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army is throwing on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: In Afghanistan stationed special units have loaded videos about operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras rotated on helmets are controlled at the air weapon support point in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already accompanied 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Defence Ministry was registered under "defence Headquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the United Kingdom Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have its own YouTube channels.
Investment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has the videos to publish the aim of recruiting soldiers, and as the Defence Ministry says, the contributions also serve to inform the people about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such a kind of published propaganda is almost free compared to traditional television advertising, so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military actions adopted by the government in their own ways.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings that create it alongside the carefully processed, censured recordings in the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken at the highest, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many of the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been loaded on the platform, but this "gattering" has only recently discovered the British for themselves.
However, the Americans advertise a little different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which players can run into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less life-sensitive simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Employee Minister Mónika Lamperth is not at all cruel: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organises a work conference where her employees can get coffee and pogatsche out in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magic Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or push into official hearts.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held in the defence resort, but the staff of the Ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas' celebration of the Origin" children are given by fallen soldiers, and at the "Missionsfeier" family members of currently stationed soldiers are held abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other ressorts, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economics and Traffics strikes.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebration is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola release.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint fertile Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the State Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The sale rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was spent for more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a NFU department is also invited at another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU money.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspiel Theater ("Vigszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the advisors.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the rooms.
Some 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech of the Minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo], it was not told: it was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Management are preparing for puritan feasts each.
The Ministry of Health arranges the feast for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Employee Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees to a Christmas celebration, not at all, but at the conference on the annual balance.
It is expected with about 180 guests who - so the press department - are only held with coffee and pogatsche, so the celebration goes out with 350,000 Forint.
Minister of Self-administration, Gordon Bajnai, will just hit his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration at its own festival hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 Forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incidence.
Since the beginning of Janos Veres' office, PM employees celebrate each year in this way.
However, there will not be any proper party stumbling - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the celebration was set up for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites Jänner to a new-year reception, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry this time.
Invite the one hundred guests to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenditure are amounted to 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which only foreign diplomas accredited in Hungary are loaded.
The receipts organised each year are traditionally starting with a short speech of the Minister and sounds with restraints.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asking for the cost of Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded to celebrate, which is organised in the art industry museum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant stripes
On Friday, the Liga trade unions and the Hungarian trade federation form their Coordination Committee for the unspecified duration starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a meeting of protests will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - will begin the work destruction.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic disabilities, as railway transport is almost completely discontinued, as well as the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) reach up to 13 a.m.
Details about the strike on Monday will be communicated on Friday afternoon by the Liga trade unions and the trade unions federation.
There is also a LIGA - MOSZ Strict Committee, which is responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest large assembly will be held, and from Monday on, all organisations that have joined the strike will put down work for an indefinite time, provided that there is no agreement with the government.
In other words, the end of the stroke starting on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the Strict Committees shall meet to consult on the further approach.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will only come to the vote on the health insurance law in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to expect significant traffic disabilities: the railwayers put their work down for an indefinite time, the majority of public transport means and more than half of the volán society are still in the morning.
At the same time, there will be many ways to block the motorway.
A number of trade unions and civil organisations have been followed by the call for strike - the list of participants is continuously updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others plan a temporary work delay.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Commerce of the Railways VDSZ, although more and more people are on the railways around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy are laying down work for four hours from the start of operation until 13 p.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy, and the teacher trade unions have called on the democratic teachers' trade unions to two or two-hour strikes.
The Hungarian physician association strikes country-wide alternating at different times, the EDDSZ, the democratic trade unions of workers in health and social care, a suborganization of the SZEF, the forum for trade cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the Liga is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discussions.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will expire from the next year.
Insistance number three is that the claimable professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ members of the Liga trade unions did not accept the offer to be submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garde increases State risk
According to the Department of Risk Analysis (Risk Analysising Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Garden founded in August with the support of the "Move for a Better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The "Risk Warning Report" of the Institute includes: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Garde, the highest political risk represents the "exacerbation of existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeunes and the non-cigal population in Hungary, which could even lead to a short-term violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Garden's strategy, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, says the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure by politically responsible parties: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of Roma questions representatives of radical political groups, which have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary counterpart."
It is assumed that this would intensify the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the probability of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Garden, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the home and foreign media, "have significant damage to the image of Hungary in abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has continued to rise, so since summer 2007 several "national self-defence association" organisations have been founded.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization each while they are openly praising to prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, order protection), under appeal to the inadequacy of the police, army, or the state itself," said it.
And further, all of this happens in accordance with that method which attempts to devote various political and party-based political efforts as a citizen initiative.
Thus, the emphasis on civil character and the association does not just serve the circumvention of legal obstacles that could appear in the course of the registration of courts - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis has been shown, the activities of the Hungarian Garden are also a risk-sensitive factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
"In the last few months, the Hungarian Garden has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Ungarn policy in the formation of the Hungarian Garden.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region', said it.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Garden is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garden are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Garden, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Based on the development of the Bulgarian garden, the Roma Mass Excursions took place in a city district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The GNU has taken the events immediately to the occasion for the establishment of the National Garden, arguing that the aim of the organisation of "national protection" is.
In their opinion, in the past 17 years, a regular "Zigeunerterror" has been noticeable in Bulgaria, but the state remained inactive and indifferent - so Political Capital.
In addition, the initiative would have elapsed a violent debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced to establish their own garden for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Garden so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Garden, it is not excluding that the Hungarian Roma also respond to the threats of their own protection, says the risk warning report by Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital said on request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk change trends should be detectable, the public opinion is informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of disposing the working days has been established around the holidays now, but the next year is less of those days.
Even in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "Feast Day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and unemployed days.
Unemployed days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are unemployed days - the latter alone can rest the Silvester celebrations.
We have a total of fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The public holidays are on March 15, which reminds the revolution of 1848, and on October 23, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the foundation of the state, the work is celebrated on 1 May, on 1 and 2 November, we remember our dead.
In addition, there are every two holidays at Easter, Pentecosts, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays are rarely falling to a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved proven in cases where we would only work a day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the longer weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is to be finalised for long years, the Ministry of Labour has laid down in its own regulation.
The law applies to all employers and employers, to public servants and officials of the public service.
Except only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on holidays.
Heuer, the working order will only be brought into question by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December, life in this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester time balances, or the holidays that have been resolved for it.
In the next year more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so there will be less disposal in working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work "on the head" so that people can stay at home at the same time four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 will be a rest day.
The second disposal depends on the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, one will have to finish on Friday, 24 October in advance.
However, the end of the year will be restless in the sign of the holidays after everything lies and remains from 24 December, even when Silvester falls on one Wednesday.
Six disturbing minorities to annoy working colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lie that no longer notice us: they bring "color" to the workplace.
The question is simply whether you get used to these small discomforts, or if you are better aware of the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstanding situations consciously for other disturbing situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," said a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At least you regret it and try to rebuild it by calling at the marketing department and repentantly allowing you to forget to deliver the message (this is the less common method).
Usually, the matter has gone away with an apology.
Before you get into embarrassed excuses, you should consider how you can really prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly something more nervous than when you get a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday it was still on the desk - is it gone today?
Or is the lost believed bullet writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has come away.
So, no envelopes or post-it from the office put into your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: nothing more if you need it.
Talk about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trade that has already been put into the world.
Who did what?
Where and why?
It is possible not to bind the information (or suspects) about the private life of the colleagues to everyone!
And if someone opens himself and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent as a grave, rather than to align those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Without a reason reported ill?
If you call at the office to report yourself sick on annoying headaches, because you just feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one: your own work, insecure completions, projects with fixed dates now have to make the colleagues instead of yourself.
So do not play badly to the colleagues!
If you know that the next day you won't get to the office, or that something could intervene, why you need to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, cocktails, telephone
You're just deepened in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the sound of the colleagues?
Unwantedly a telephone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not use the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you lead across your heads), trampling, continuous squirrel or nerves.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deeply involved in a task (write, plan, organize).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not finished in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the debt of your own forgottenness!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the novel colleagues!
The best way to admit his mistakes is to apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to recover the mistake, or how to recover the neglect, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training shoes and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but nothing lost in the office!
Not even then you should dress such a army if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so far that you dress in the office - if you wish, also beautiful and elegant!
All want to make it right - or how do you become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio a strange melody: the sound of a goat, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the sounds previously, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which comes to Mr 2.
The home music scene hasn't made us disturbed with a quality electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the rest different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage rock with its guitar kit is again "in" that proves local electropop: there is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, even musiced in the band Yonderboi before he – perhaps because a host doesn't handle two peppers – began to describe his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but he only managed when you asked to compose the sound track to a movie, he had come to him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Torök.
The formation that occurred at the beginning in smaller clubs was only known to the broader audience when the magazine "wan2" rided its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to almost the only, even in the western marketable tendency.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but no one was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand too.
The band has responded how it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album published now with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the titles already express the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz's Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would be okay, but next to the etheric character of the music, the - the time spirit and trends - sounder guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it a radio stroke - the most newly sent from early to late pop music, Mr2 Petñofi, has put the listener with the number "Wings of Love", which has been recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas"), successively the ear worm.
So it's all right (?).
The Hvg.hu asked Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "Spot Music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in pop music, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be seen and nothing to say, but they can also be produced only for sale that makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The reception will also work independently according to this principle, languages and national borders.
What do you see? Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially western, pop music has a bigger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that pass around them much more carefully because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important to who, where, how many people hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is mostly evident in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but it is only in the immature changes of the moment.
Yet, I noticed one: If you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's traveling as a soloist and has built his career in the west.
B. Zs.: We do not really go his way, even if you try to interpret this again and again in our music.
We see ourselves rather than team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them come out.
At first, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: The charts of Mr2 Petēfi are first placed in "Wings of Love".
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style in the direction of a wider audience consciously?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that should then be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the soundorgie and the a little more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why was she, what was the lead principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to compile the choir from talented solicists of the domestic music scene.
Thus the six-headed choir was created - so Sena, Edina Cutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikě Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which we then baptized after "Underground Divas".
What would you like to have the song, or did the girls co-form it?
B. Zs.: The number was in the instrumental version for longer, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number still needed something.
The acknowledgement has formally requested a vocal vote.
I sang the melody in the same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on the hive and terrifying spontaneously.
I remember, I was quite electricized at the time, but it needed the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, however, they had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, sing perfectly together and are not harder than music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They also stood behind on the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they were behind was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not deliberately want to allow them to have solo rolls.
The number is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who's coming from and where we're going, we simply allow these specific wings, the wings of love, to lift up.
I would like others to feel this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most important song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creation work, there has been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove didn't want to work anymore, but gradually everything has merged together, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
For example, Zs.: This is changing with the concerts and also now that I have the album "losading".
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Intriguing makers risked billions of minority feelings
Groundless deceivers
This is the name of his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société Genérale, owner of the hierige Komerční banka.
It came about five billion euros because of it.
It seems, however, that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same thing to his colleagues, and was surely not incapable.
In contrast to all major bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally weak," was to hear from the mouth of his managers who showed him at the police.
However, as the statements of Kerviel, published by the French media, for example the Le Monde newspaper, he was a man who had gained 1,6 billion euros with his businesses at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just at the U.S. crisis.
For he had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime hypothesises, such as poor customers or those who had previous disbursement problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and maintained justice.
At the end of the year, he had swallowed up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain this," Kerviel admits and continues that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he has faked documents so that you can't get him to the disaster.
He even managed to lead his boss behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchanges were gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Société Genérale in 2000, immediately after he had finished his study at Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was a assistant of a maker and in 2005 he became an independent maker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"But at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the inquiry officers.
But soon after his entrance, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting a half billion euro on course losses of this title at the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you
"This is like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the chiefs said they knew everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I earned money, the eyes were closed."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great battle came.
On one day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in the middle of January, he wanted to compensate.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer employer of the bank.
And a few days later the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He was suspicious by a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to see him in the cards," said Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministry and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can be EUR 14 billion in the next few years (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is about half of the sum which the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns are made from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the development of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 per cent of the fund resources that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The business and innovation programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies gain funds for innovative businesses.
This will help companies to gain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The current EU fund monetary acquisition includes Czech Republic among the new accession countries among the least successful countries so far.
Nicaraguan Court confirms twenty-year penalty for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year penalty for the former president Arnold Alemán, which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (at least $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest at his Hazienda at the Nicaraguan Metropole.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) comes back to this Mediterranean State, according to the news agency AP, is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to let Alemán sit his punishment at home or if he has to go to prison.
A court pointed out four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred the government’s money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest attendants.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budgets
Yes, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) was still approved for the current year because Minister Sobotka (by this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not allow him to reject it.
Unlike a vivid debate before the vote on the request for distrust against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Members approved this traditionally low-observed, yet very important law in all tranquillity.
This is paradox.
All governments start and end with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the government's and opposition's power struggle.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, so they give him more attention.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting for the public than faster numbers.
The government budgets have been under three shortcomings in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot be disposed of at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which has decided the "suspending" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the communities.
However, the greatest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors issued additional sources of investment except taxes, taxes and bank loans, often unconsidered debt debt debts by which they owed their council houses overwhelmingly.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying these debts through massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks which they had received in the train of privatisation from the State.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only hold on to official and verifyable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been running through a growth phase for a few years, such as the rest of the world, whose ČSSD is familiar with it.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments to settle public finances.
Rather, these governments debted the State more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame mainly to be attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least threatened by poverty, seen in the global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which have been exhausted in a gigantic extent in recent years.
Even if it has been successful to strike some of the stupid population expenditure that were adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it is not coming to a shift of pension age and a pension reform, it will end practically any policy in this country, and, regardless of who is in power, it will remain nothing but a pure administrator.
It is only easy to exaggerate when you say that then there will be officials from dominant politicians who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenues on pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but only the restraint of normal expenditure through obligation expenditure can be suspended.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would certainly be overwhelming if previous governments had not spent in the past ten years, what was only going on.
If we do not want it to really be made of rulers to become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the State can spend only as much as it can take on taxes and fees in order to want rest when preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow progressive implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on financial markets.
Thus, more than $100 billion will come to monetary markets by means of auctions.
On these auctions the banks increase interest rates to which they are ready to borrow each other.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars to auction, another 24 make it easy for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, following the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to defence or destruction of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that banks can grant," wrote a report to his customers Bernard Baumöhl from the Economic Outlook Group advisory company.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added cotton in his report.
The banks have already lost around $60 billion because of unemployed loans, especially in the United States.
Analytics are expecting further billions of losses.
"The central banks must really have been afraid of what can be done when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro, Kieran Davies, manager.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, credits become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and fall into a recession for the American economy, possibly affecting global economic growth.
The central banks have decided to, after they had failed to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in the loan between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other money, although the US, Canada and Great Britain Central Banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the upheating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change is claimed to be the most damage to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed his opinion on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the final international UN conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he concluded that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and such of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric it accompanies, and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a replacement for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President pointed out in his book that its topic was very important for him and that he therefore engaged in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet with caricatures of my views."
So now interesting ones could read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus reminded that he was not a climate toologist, but he believes he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is eventually academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional negotiations, has experience in statistics and is also a national economic operator.
As the main statement of the book, he described these that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and thus are not threatening, and that efforts to influence the climate's development are excessive, effective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it as a person who has experience with totalitarian systems that unacceptable to force other unexposed views, which he considers as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On the questions of the present, he repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant ecoactivists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and profit."
Klaus had spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driver's license
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity lasts at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driver licence until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are going on the roads without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, those who do not want to drive any more have mainly not exchanged their license.
While small places report a strong decline of interest in the exchange of carriers, the offices of the capital are transferred with requests, and the interest in exchange has grown this week.
The city administration completes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licences.
The exhibition of a new driver license takes 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a short term of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and run off without a valid driving licence threaten a penalty from January.
The wrongdoer pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
But the police can also allow it to be used with an admonition when it comes to transgression.
In the case of a violation, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the municipality can also impose a penalty that does not drive at all.
He could threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the offices to leave mildness and at least a punishment of 1,000 crowns.
The speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, says no one threatens a thousand crown punishment.
The license is a document where everyone can decide whether he wants it or not.
It is not a personnel card that everyone, and that is a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality or to send him there by registration.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, the drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years of time for exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other driving licences.
Judgment reduces punishment for detectives connected with Berdych
The former police officers Joseph Opava and Petr Ko'ařík, who are accused of having done jointly with the bands of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided in a legal judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its penalty by two years or by two years.
Originally the detectives of the "Amt for the Fight of Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no way of appeal against today's judgment, only audit at the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of in this case, but first of all, he is in favour of the first-instant judgment.
However, in other processes, he had already received a total of 16 years of punishment.
He can't be sentenced to more.
In January, a district court blamed 19 people mainly for participation in robbery, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants argued from the beginning with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, members of the police, in agreement with Berdych criminals, provided information from sources of police, covered various assaults, and helped members of the bands to get away from criminal prosecution.
The bands left Opava and Ko ́ařík 30 percent of the prey.
The accusation concerns crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robbery, whose victims often suffered severe injuries, but also for official assumption and unauthorized arms possession.
The police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser target remote tube and a machine gun.
According to the accusation, the band has enriched by many millions of crowns by their assaults.
Except nearly 20 men in this proceedings, Berdych courts and a number of others legally recognized as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circuit have to be responsible in another trial, other cases have not yet come before the court.
The main negotiation has been to date Tomáš Pβta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery for criminal prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to require 12 million crowns compensation plus judicial costs for the exchange of children in an exemption clinic from the Třebíč Hospital.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million, and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore did not agree with Velebas' proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too much high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"In order to make us an opinion on this counter proposal, however, we need the opinion that the other side has made.
We'll find out if it's worth of explanation at all.
However, we believe that this should be for all together in the hundreds of thousands," stressed Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jabloñov family wanted a million crowns for each month she hadn't raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, a opinion was made for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol as a basis for compensation negotiations.
Parents of children believed that psychology and psychiatry had mental damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men wore the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations against them that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
In turn, the women are dealing with the adverse effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is now going on, Veleba gathered the content together.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged the nurses of the excavation clinic in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo
At the end of October, the district head of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Märische Höhe) delivered 100000 kroner to each family as a replacement for expenditure which had been generated by the failure of the hospital in Třebíč under the district.
All hospitals in Czech Republic are insured by law on account of liability.
If they are doubtful, they must take a reserve fund, and only exceptionally they can apply for assistance to the carrier.
The courts have so far responded to low amounts of injury to affected persons, the amounts were determined by tables and have moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came through his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight about the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the district court in Ostrava, he first used the name "Whale King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in long-term work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably make a call.
"The struggle is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitary," said after the negotiation, Polívkas lawyer.
Everyone imagined the words "Whale Kingdom" just these actors and comics.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have a nearly ten years of work behind us.
Money acquisition and concepts of activities," he said.
He says that the cause is a struggle for money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasitically at our work," he continued.
Random business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Whale King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actress Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But it was not the purpose of justifying a fictional kingdom at that time.
Some years later, Harabiš came to the idea of publishing walachic passports.
From an initially funny action, a business and entrepreneurship crystalized out, and Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Walachic Kingdom".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions when visiting his farm and his theatre ideas.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the only idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurship intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has safely helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were intensely dedicated to him.
The collaboration of the controversial parties today lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš organised the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš, the disputes began to be collapsed in the "King Boleslavs I. elected to the Sankt Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership then took advantage of Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka sent the complaint against Harabiš and his company, which was rejected by the court today.
Clearness in the struggle could bring the race prepared by Harabiš around the throne and a half princess.
There was a new king to come out of this.
Details and a date he didn't want to tell you yet.
"We don't want to hurry.
It should be like the royal circuit in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also log in quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Previous disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much worth, the quality of the circuit switching, the control and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his follower, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combi with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just stay to review my opinion.
For example, when I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about the little freedom of head on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer there, because the combi's carosserie is designed so that not even two meters of men will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I'm just going through the interior to not repeat too much.
It is a rather successful design, where I have objections only because of the careful middle tunnel.
There I would welcome some more designing design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable and the times are over when we may complain about short seats or headsets.
The side content has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
With regard to the space offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the carosserie.
In the combi, the lack of freedom of head already mentioned is also removed.
Bags in the bagroom
But the main thing about this car is the cargo room.
I must call it (also due to the foldable back window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The hole rooms are equipped with holding belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be distinguished and hold more difficult items.
But let's talk about the charging volume.
It is, according to the table in the basic equipment, 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains about 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign vacation or when a children's car is invited.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the flat cargo space after the rear seat's folding, or the very low cargo edges.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzine engine with a hubraum of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, such a 1600-cubic engine should look like a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption, and he's moving well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems to be his outpuff with a laptop, then I can only be enthusiastic by him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not exactly national.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inner and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at a height of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite much.
The premium equipment of the test truck again beat with 80000 crowns in addition to books.
However, we had headair bags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc washing, electric window-shaping back and...
Thus the car totally costs simple 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but you can count on the addition of a fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains what brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe is increasing, causing the inhabitant fears of further development of local schooling.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hit a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the disputes between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually rising.
Disputes, squirrels and robberies among students have been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron bar.
The accused defended that the boy inflicted her with racist abuses.
The police also had to intervene after a attack of two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls claimed to have made racist comments to the man and bought him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed to a bus house and spotted at us.
When I told him to stop, he purchased us with apples and pears and then exposed his seat," a mother of Slovak students of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the inhabitants even referred to the fight with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival fight.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between indigenous and immigrants in British schools becomes increasingly tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70,000 Slovakians were reported to come here on work search.
Thus, some 30,000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really a island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this will be fulfilled if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quietly like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with cellars offering on the beach of Pizza, ice and disturbing cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find that in abundance.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their Bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havanna once became a camp or surrounding camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
Building made it one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime in the United States (especially during the ban), was gladly seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among them.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high houses grew, over the wide Boulevards, cars that were among the cultivation symbols of the fifties of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojimar he had his hunt.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio Stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autogram.
The bar at the Nacional Hotel mixes cocktails for you as you like.
And the 50's cult cars are driving around in Havanna until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long been disrupted in the salty and moist air.
Mag Havanna, especially his oldest part, has become strongly downstairs, nowhere in the surroundings can be found as many wonderful colonial sights as right here.
Other places are just exhausted, for example Trinidad.
In order to ensure that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only been created in Havanna but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on islands like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Kuba offers another marot that is unique in the world and mainly attracts railway lovers.
The sugar tube of remote plants brought steam and diesel-driven railways to the sugar factories.
Their driving park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see tough and fully functioning locomotives, whose older companions are located elsewhere in the museum.
Departure targets
The most important places do not expose the majority of visitors to Cuba.
This is how you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana.
Just mention that in the already mentioned estate of Hemingways there is a museum whose visit should not be escaped by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The growing vegetation grows on limestone floor.
The Mogotas, calcium hills and fences, raged up steeply from the valley floor, gathered in their hollow rooms fruitful soils, through which also feathered rock areas are covered by dense plants.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In his final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Some may also seem interesting that the Chilean consequences of the "Major Zeman" series were turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spaniards had colonized the island.
Honor and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth was represented in the tasteful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is a so distant place that there was no road that would have linked the area with the rest of the country in the 1950s of the last century.
This isolation contributed to disregarding it.
Nothing was built there, but so nothing was cut off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach of Playa Ancón or the "Tal of the sugar factories".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Musica, which lives after the darkness, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in eastern Cuba calls some the most beautiful island.
Surely this view is also affected by the way there.
Both roads leading by Guantánamo must overcome high and crushed mountains and pass through a landscape that is hardly affected by human interventions.
These eastern preposts of Cuba, thanks to the unaffected nature there, took UNESCO into their world heritage directory.
There the best chocolate is manufactured, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it has arisen about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains are to be seen from which El Yunque is the most known.
About the coffee, the room, the cigars, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the swine Bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, a African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess, many of these could be written.
Yes, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Alliances in Afghanistan are passive, claim Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, draw up a specific plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not follow its ideas, and in the Scottish Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries who have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating states also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through their defence minister Robert Gates, called on the NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan a progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to start even the development of the economy and security," says British Des Browne Des Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activities of Afghan rebellors have, according to the American army, reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even in the southern province of Helmand by 60 per cent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
In fact, they demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts for training the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke similarly.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to lands and air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and this is too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency at the conclusion of three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there is also a dispute between the countries involved about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany has been criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers Faulpelze this week.
"Afghanian Non-Stuary disappears: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image newspaper went over to the opposite attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a Rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will speed up to a billion in 2009
On each Czech is a government debt of 84000 crowns.
The total debt increased to 842,7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt 159,2 billion wives this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion thanks to the better development of state budgetary policies.
The government debts of the Czech Republic increased to 842,7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Thus, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on State debts from early October.
On each Czech is a debt of 84000 crowns.
Over the last year, the state debted over 111 billion crowns.
"To now it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may exceed the limit of a billion crown until 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crown," said David Marek, analytist of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analytics of the next finance: "We could come over a billion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget that we do not know yet.
If it should be demonstrated that the situation is changing at the political stage and politicians should be willing to save more, this may last by 2010.
But from such a change I do not go out," he noted.
Growth of debt
The government debt is due to the debts of the government and is primarily from the collection of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by tax instructions, government debts, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
Inland debt increased this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debts of the State now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 12.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached at the end of September 803,3 billion crowns and has decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average debt debt expired to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is.
It is interesting that growth is notably recorded in debt prescriptions, where the growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt rises, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," commented Pikora.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and handling of government debts for 2007 shows that the government had planned 159,2 billion crowns for this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152,8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of state budgetary policies.
This amount is particularly affected by the government budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also the maximum funds for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroners, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt debts for 43 billion and the rates for the loans at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy Bear, she was presented to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan was sentenced by a court in Khartum to 15 days on Thursday evening and subsequent exhortation.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddy Bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be pissed out.
Following several complaints from the Sudanese Ministry of Cultus, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of the infringement of Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal law.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school manager Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favorite first name.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself had no sign with that name, but the problem is very simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knows them well, and she would never have done anything that could have drawn her close to a religious belief, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name , that his view is just an innocent mistake .
One opinion that shares numerous students of the teacher who describe this as very careful to her students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
Remember that the first name is Mohammed, at the same time, the second name given in the UK is the most frequently used second name for which there are 14 different writings in English.
This often selected first name of Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give him a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, there was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiation session in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status , explained European mediator Wolfgang Izinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis that peace in the region is at stake, its American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are standing at the beginning of a very difficult time , he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the negotiations on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday for the last time.
The future of the 90% of Albanian speakers could become clear if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation session since the Troikas had received the UN’s mission to a new negotiation last August.
Americans and Europeans expect their contract to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, will continue negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains the speaker of a negotiated solution, a unanimous solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After the Kosovo has been under UN management for eight years, western countries consider independence under EU supervision for the only solution with the future.
Pristina appears willing to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide for their benefits.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday the last chance.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared its regret.
He added , however , that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past which led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President, Boris Tradic, was of the opinion that a compromise was always an attempt, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a single-sided declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be made solely and alone in the Security Council, where Russian allies had a veto law.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only one decision from the series of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia , explained the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They have to end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that every one-sided declaration of independence from the sides of the Albanian-speaking population will end in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had been gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final arrangement for the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, explained Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Road Road Plan that they agreed in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately aimed at an agreement of peace, which was intended to clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues .
This name includes the three serious problems that are the main concerns of the disputes between Israel and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who have been displaced from their home in the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
After the American President, Abbas took the word and insisted that the coming negotiations should be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word, he committed himself to conducting the coming weapon stop negotiations directly and without interruption and to endeavor to complete them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli that exists next to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken over by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a divorce path in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks at the roots of the conflict and at its central points, says the Saudi-Arabian Prince in his interview with the Arabic newspaper financed by Saudi money.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel in the direction of Villiers-le-Bel was driven on Sunday, shortly after 17 p.m.
He had no operation, but was on line, and drove 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, i.e. not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two youths without helmet, driven with very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had neglected its advance from the right, a policeman continued.
Alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The state of the car (beaten cotflies, splintered windprotection skirts, ripped stairs) shows the tightness of the sprout.
Very fast, yesterday morning, the State Advocate of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an inquiry on the "facts of the involuntary person murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger" in conjunction with the main public security management of Val-d`Oise.
On the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the detection of the IGPN in this stage of the police.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were listened to Sunday evening have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of rival, surely caused by the stripping of the foot stains on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been stuck in one another until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been captured and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obscured yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a reputation quickly made the round, so the police had left the accident place very quickly, and that without providing help to the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude this matter as regards any serious error.
According to a police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations necessary for further investigations , and it has to be done very carefully .
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, tells this Witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman hanging.
Two more attempted to revive one of the young people who called fourth .
In view of the excitement that had quickly emerged about the occurrence and, as it seems, due to the certainty that the present people had about the unforeseen situation of young people, the police were taken into the car of colleagues encountered at the accident site.
Still, according to this witness statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
You have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I'm not going to allow it to be claimed that the police forces had not helped young people.
It has been first helped by this youth.
The firefire came immediately.
It was done everything to try to save her , and she stressed the prosecutor.
In Pakistan, the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations, since two days earlier, General Musharraf had proclaimed the emergency.
According to witness statements, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken under the emergency were injured in the city of Lahore in the eastern part of the country by the tearing gas grenades that the order forces used there.
They were throwing stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and hurt lawyers.
Several of them would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionians, prosecutors of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Further demonstrations would have been found in Multan (Midden) and in Peshawar (Nord-East).
On Monday the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the mighty covenant Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency, and to the waste that had put an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promises are no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure which was announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and opposed to the decisions of the Supreme Court, said the Magistrate of the newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the chief command on the army and to become a civil president no longer applies since calling on the emergency, stated Monday the Vice-Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ends as president.
The Vice-Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be deferred from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government demented the reputations that persisted in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his vice-president.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Also today, 40 years after the adoption of the Newwirth Act, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years using the pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has yet made it possible to improve the control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
For one out of five pairs even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems the most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collektor, which is essential for continuing scientific work on the station.
A waved exit that, due to its duration, the removal of inhabitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the space drive Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17,5 tons heavy module for power generation over solar collektors that were already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew restructured the solar collektors of the module, with a span of 76 meters.
And when it happened, one of the collections that appeared like accordeons was damaged by a cable sticked on a length of about a meter.
The restructuring has been stopped to avoid damage to the collector.
The astronauts who initially leave the space drive Discovery for a control course and then should repair another suncollector whose rotation system was defective were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arm of the space crafts that had been placed on the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old physician was thus chosen to operate the injured suncollector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he separated the defective cable and fixed a kind of rail on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey hit, wrapped with isolator, to prevent an electrical hit on the sun collektors that produce several hundred volts, the astronauts had thought and built on the station.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully folding up before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space travel Discovery to expect the return to the earth on Wednesday.
Title EADS sancted on the stock exchange
After the group of aviation and defence has announced that it will have to spend between 1,2 and 1,4 billion euros in order to counteract the remains of the A400M, the EADS share currently shows a significant decline at the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently EADS loses 4% on 21.96 Euro on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again, referring to the residues caused by the slowly progressing development of the A400M engine which delay the fly's virgin flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in delivering their military transport aircraft amounted to EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus , the mother group of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month residue.
To remember, the EADS business performance was falling from 86% in 2006, essentially due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The selection of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the Urns: the Mass of Russia will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very locked election struggle, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even of authority.
Three days before Parliament's elections, the Russian President Wladimir Putin sends a message to the voters who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his characteristic as a top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and satisfied with delivering a new attack point against the Western powers which are accused of the interference- his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope to have honest elections, very transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the view of the opposition, they have remained there.
She's practicing an oppressive election fight.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there had never been such dirty choices, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations last weekend, for ex-sachers' champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrations was sentenced to five days of arrest, according to his lawyer, the ban on visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these Parliament elections without excitement, two more important questions are raised:
Who will join Putin's successor as president?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he has been elected 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Wladimir Putin cannot enter for a third mandate in success.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the Almighty Party of the United Nations Russia, which will elect government and President?
Whatever it will be, when it comes to parliamentary or presidency elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: the civil society has delayed the development of individuality in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries to Europe.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, as this new patriarchism was not a terrorist, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians abstain from free pieces of personal responsibility which they took shortly after the destruction of the Soviet Union.
What do you think about for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional chairmen) are leading to the local election lists of the United Russian.
The new liberties coming from the West are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What do you think about?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they resolve?
A Heavy Memorial
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been located in Bad Arolsen 27 km, could not be seen until now, unless with an humanitarian intent, that is, individually and namely, on the question of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the 11 states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, have agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heavy Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, the director of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, have been able to make these name-related documents accessible to the public because of the warmest nature of certain information.
For example, the claimed homosexuality or the spiritual disability of some deportation sacrifices.
The lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo had been gathered for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to compulsory work, and to provide them with a evidence of their arrest, in order to enable them to take the way to their remuneration.
In Bad Arolsen today, more than 300 firmly employed tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to expect fundamental new in these documents, Mr Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the University of Technology in Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
The mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the most important trade partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Minister for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, stated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is the first trade partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but, according to the numbers of the European Commission, India is only the nineth trade partner of the EU.
A free trade covenant will promote the two economic areas enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe forms the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commission continued. The Asian and European giants exchange goods in the value of EUR 47 billion and services at the value of EUR 10 billion this week, Daniéle Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's Delegation in New Delhi, explained and regrets the fact that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India will meet on Friday to their eight diplomatics in New Delhi, at the meeting of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the disturbance and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current recursive concern about the credit conditions, and announced a ten billion pounds offering a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears that the financial market conditions will be particularly hard at the end of the year and to give banks a greater certainty of how to organize their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, in a communication.
The Bank continues that GMT of 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be circulated on 6 December, to the basic rate and only to 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE brings liquidities in a open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it will be willing to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbankic loans from day to day with its basic interest rate.
The between banking interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has penetrated to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums of the Bank of England have been linked with fees which the banks had prevented from taking them into account.
According to some reputations, strengthened by the development of the pounds' rate in contrast to the euro, many prefer to sign for the sums that the European Central Bank brought into circulation, to more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to verify the PS’s proposals for purchase power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre were refusing to discuss the articles of the socialist legal template for purchasing power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist nisch (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated approximately ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which the majority of 50% for employment allowance, for the re-introduction of the TIP fleet, for a transport check or for the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main discussion, which led to partially violent exchanges of words between majority and opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchase power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that its group will present the total of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the finances examined by the Assamblee last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is a honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and not less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 informed on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campsites.
The festival will probably take place from 8 to 10 August on a 500 acre large private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The leader of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added his portfolio to Leeds Festival and then, 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production, license concessions and organising tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones from C3, the Glastonbury, describes as the most inspiring event at which he has ever been there, says that his company and that of Melvin Benn work parallelly together to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We chose Philadelphia as a market and cooperate zealously with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We made negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in police debates on current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we meet preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the people."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza - Festival 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago after it was profiled in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the Festival.
The two events were able to achieve 9.8 million dollars each in 2007 and 11.8 million dollars in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas the weirds rather take place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts into one another in some way, while communicating the impression of a rural festival to the European and a city in the American way."
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to give up the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take up a festival that hopes to have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3 who received the top Independent Promoter price of the last Bollboard Touring Award are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no lesser than the Terminator opposes it.
These lock attempts are one of the delegates' tasks.
A political "hiikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who claims "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Gouvernor?
"You must be careful because it's the industry that decides where to go.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who you think are best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, it is now the priority of preparing the cinema in that area.
The hunting for the Oscars has started.
On all the festival on the western coast, although that of Sundance, the one of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec, evaluating them and ensuring that the producers are interviewed.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange ahead of an end-year rally? disagreement with experts due to the U.S. hypothesis crisis
With nearly five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already screwing their hands with regard to the coming end-year Rally.
However, experts cannot make any safe forecasts in this respect.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December is usually connected with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create prognoses short-term and only based on statistics, especially when serious tensions determine the current market occurrence
Although other experts do not approve such a strong increase in the course in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which, due to the lack of secure share funds, is mainly invested in pension funds, which is very affected by the rising trend to profitable assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the stock exchange will have a more lateral trend affected by market variations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decline in the US note bank's interest rate, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the raw oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the BPI sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a vigilant time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum brand on November 8, of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyzer at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with nearly 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional support taken by this time.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year things could develop something different, especially because of the end-year rally that is already taking place in the second December week, and then directly after the bridge day on the Constitution's day.
According to the analyst, price variations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyzer at the Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are almost technical, which could lead to a short-term deviation of index values, depending on the consequences of the U.S. hypothesis crisis.
The analytist is confident that these are positive.
When selecting the values to forward the Ibex to new maximum measures, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney delights that this year are the big values in line.
One of the value winners would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, since the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha is assured by the Bank Inversis that the increases in the bank and industry will be associated.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACP was on retirement course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, says the expert.
With regard to increased consumer behaviour during Christmas, the market will be determined in the last half of the year.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive turnover results even if they are represented in the Spanish market only in a small number.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the December has only shown in two cases a decline in courses.
When the technology blow was placed at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, when Ibex 35 picked up at 28.17 percentage points, the December showed a rate increase of 6.68%.
Whether the fifth profitable year will be followed in 2008 (Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and a final year will also show itself.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions opened from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
Overall 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, since Popular as the first banking group would dare to extend the opening hours of its branches on the week to 20.30h and set up on Saturday from 10h to 20.30h.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly read the extension of their opening periods in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations by the Bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an agreement at which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and open for it on a week afternoon, although not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative adapting to business opening times will depend on the Popular Bank's experience values.
And just that is the intention of the Popular to pursue with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches, which, due to their situation, are able to cover the buy-only customership of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening times.
To this end, the Bank will transform the rooms of the establishments already in business zones and simultaneously comply with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus the expansion of opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more recent, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require larger investments, but was involved with an increased staff position, since a branch no longer needed six, but eight or nine employees.
The establishments, even equipped with additional rooms for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Populars are currently running about 2500 branches.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these departments of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them will offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale instead.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
They have been provisionally agreed with telephonica to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish Private Sender Telecinco doubled his stock exchange value for the first time and thus overreached its rivals antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the end of the stock exchange. The transmitter led by him had increased his value by two times his rival antena 3.
However, one aspect weakened his joy: that's exactly what hurts me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he discovered.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they were not too deeply dropped.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches €4.88.88 million, with mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento is only involved with 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other börsnotated communications companies rises; in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (release of Cinco Días) to 2,518,53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
Comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still appears, in what extent we can actually act on stock exchanges, at which price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco explained a week ago his project to rise to the first television broadcaster this year with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising statements by 3.6% compared to 965,4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for the better exchanges of Telecinco in comparison, the analysts see at the high payout rate that the company could have until the current date: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarria caused a 100-percent dividend emission.
However, Vasile assures that the ratio after buying 33% of the shares of end mol, with mediaset as a parent company, could still vary even if it is too early for official notification.
We are obliged to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have been increasingly more and more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we could already increase by buying from 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently shows some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% this year and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of the decrease in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% to 8.4% in 2008 and 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on its high efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (cooping) is more favourable than Antena 3 (keeping) because of the many incentives and the prospering market.
3.
JPM organ: Recommended to reduce expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climates)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive that entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to Parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the additional/change applications associated with the project, the Government published the provisions that are based on the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both regulations until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of Congress and Senate delegates who had pursued the objective of their negotiations and votes to set up the best possible arrangements to ensure investor security and regulate individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure a general efficient market occurrence.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-determines the system of securities services, pursues an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the demand for control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows to provide financial advice to specialised companies as well as to natural or legal persons and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services undertakings (ESIS) to the advisory companies connected with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
Furthermore, it extends the number of systems for the implementation of financial transactions so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral systems of the effect business and to the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually be competing with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their business profile, confrontation and forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congress Economic Commission provided further amendments, while the decision that the debt debt issued with titles must now be seen as complex financial means due to its high risk level for the investor, confirmed by the U.S. hypothesis and banking crisis. (US hypothesis crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working fields of educated economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the fields of work reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate established new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator, who works on foreign account, do not require authorisation from the CNMV and can provide its services for the commercialisation of products and for customer production at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator that Eurostat serves to assess inflation rates within the European Union delivers the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which are aimed at a local and quality comparison with U.S. products by disclosure of data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared in advance by applying the same approach as with the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) advised that the preliminary indicator should only serve as a guide value and therefore do not conform to the final result announced on 14 December.
Consumer Price Index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Vice-President of the Government and the Economic and Financial Ministry Pedro Solbes , the rise of the VPI was a temporary development in November ; at the same time it assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the next few months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good , the inflation difference between Spain and other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
In addition, he explained that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such an increase.
We expected a value of about 4% , announced by the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance as regards the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
The value stocks of Northern Rock have decreased by more than half after the Bank in mid-September of last year asked the British Notenbank for an emergency credit, and they are now only 12,000 million pounds (which is 16,800 million euros).
At that time, the bank's assets were recorded as a total of 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has been significantly decreased within two and a half months by customers' loss of confidence and even despite the government's hundred percent guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis will continue to decline.
The Virgin company, who would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to take about a quarter of the incomes of the British banks, which will be composed there from the installations of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds needed to achieve their 30 billion target.
The group of multimillionary Richard Branson, known by his outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to run 50,000 million pounds per year in advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as his preferred tenderer to lead it out of the insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
On this morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales last May, currently members of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipality of Totana, and could be the original tractor of the complot, according to information by the broadcaster Cadena SER.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and of the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information of the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore privileged Members of Juan Morales were arrested in the absence of his client's residence due to major burdenful documents that are to be linked to the complot.
In addition, other sources of information report from the supposed order payments of Morales to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a city building contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares large area was decided.
At present, eight people are investigated.
Bono agrees to accept the PSOE's candidateship in Toledo and, the case of a election victory, at the convention.
The former Minister for Defence José Bono has adopted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, which will therefore take over the list of PSOE candidates in the coming general elections in Toledo and, in the case of a election of socialists, the Office of the Congress President.
So it announced José Blanco, the organisation secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the party's headquarters.
The Head of Government believes that the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for socialists, the Mancha politicians would seem to be the president of the Party in the coming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, which, last 15 November, announced that he would no longer enter into the next general elections, end his career in public politics and take career in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his retirement two years ago, the President of the Government has constantly pressed his return to political events.
Furthermore , he pointed out that the party , as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs , did not want to prevent the citizens who would take over the posts of the Congress President in the event of an election victory , and described this as an act of transparency .
If he really should take over the office, he hopes that the chamber will become a house of respect, not the insult or the cry, to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gains the impression that the only place in which you cannot speak quietly and left in Madrid is the convention; so the President of the government in the Senate has been interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and stated that he did not want to raise the appearance that the office had already taken over, since otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate underlines both the skeptics of climate change and those emphasizing a social and political debate on this matter, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, which, as in the case of the President-in-Office of the Government, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new contract with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it in the noise of declaration on the action or non-trading of its government, which has contributed vitally to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries that have at least complied with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for not complying with the rules, which sectors are the result of this, and why has its government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures he has planned against climate change without delay.
What companies are concerned about the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective savings measures and the economic consequences of them.
Exactly, who must sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about the sacrifice and payment.
For the measures that can be taken really against climate change are unfavourable.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol centre proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared to be strategicly so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now true to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty speeches without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politicians who otherwise suited for election campaigns do not have to talk, accuse, or demand, but instead follow the demanding edition, decorate meetings, and enthusiastic others with his mildness and kindness.
But this can only happen if the Treaty does not differ from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not predict that the bike will be the only means of movement in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a facility.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to a supposed development in urban corruption.
Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Todana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police officer, the Secretary of the Mayor Office and a hotel entrepreneur, because of the suspected suspicion of urban infringements, was observed today by research circuits.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from where it was brought to the municipality office and in its rooms until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who were also encountered in the urban administration and the municipal construction office of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests have been linked to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of unfinished construction for urban projects should be restructured under the management of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property after the local administration has received illegal provision during the last legislature period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation procedure which is caused and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrested persons have been presented to the judge today.
According to research circuits, it is also established against the former mayor of Totana and the current independent PP delegate Juan Morales.
Also, his ex-wife, the owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his present, remaining friend in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is supposed to have functioned as a part group of Nuaria and received the money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban delicates, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies which were directly linked to the arrests held in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry farmer, supposed to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria construction group was assigned to build the largest residential complex of the village belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which was to be reconstructed. The aim was to achieve a construction project which would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes further companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and preconiza, specialized in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree with this, we will turn away from the expression Book of the month and instead try to invent a price-name other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, published comment (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; randomly on that day, whose edition contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy sector has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy about the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the horrible murders is an abitor who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview by Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for the Philosophy Section, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position towards Platon and suggested that the teaching of Platon from the subgraduate teaching plans for the philosophy of gymnasia.

A colleague informed about the entry of illegal Internet downloads into the criminal lawbook:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of law, which was taken with six months of prison.
However, once again, if you rob a music business under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of EUR 1000, the steal will be a penalty rate, yet the penalty will be lower than when downloaded (Article 234 criminal law).
C. If you clap a car and return it forty hours later, then the punishment is still lower than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a struggle than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute a prison penalty of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the criminal law), while the exchange of data results in a freedom withdrawal of six months to up to two years.
(Article 270 of the criminal law).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the criminal law book, sexual injury at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose authorization has not taken place by the authors, is exposed to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, someone has screwed up his demands quite well.

My house doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from monthly wage payment are dependent on the salaries of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Brain Brain Brain, activation was then the strongest if the participants gave the correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers could realize that the brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and then received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, it also became a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
State prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been insulting for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan Wars. Its office is located in La Haya's State Attorney at the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, since the chief officers of the massacre of Srebrenica - at the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - are still on the free foot - the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are on the list, which the director Marcel Schüpbach, originating in Switzerland, proposes for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, in Spain, not yet entered); a film that follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York with the speed of a police thriller in order to close their networks.
What insurance is best suited for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost charge, which is still dependent on various factors, including age, gender, time of the creation of a driver's license, family status, the type of the car to be assured and its use, etc.
Having a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, you have to know what we have to do with this.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be held in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to submit the corresponding sum of recovery in a case of injury.
The insurance premium is the price of a insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of creation of a licence, family status, type of vehicle to be assured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to statistics, so that higher risks of accidents will also be made up to higher contribution payments.
For this reason, both over 25-year-old and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore, according to the conviction of companies, tend to less accidents than alone.
The benefit to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
When the premium is set up, insurance must take account of a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs.
We are now listening to the most important points to be considered in the selection of insurance, in order not only to make a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Under 25-year-olds, in choosing a price-effective insurance, there are numerous obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete full-risk insurance, there are more price-value alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full casco with self-inclusive participation, so that the benefits of full-casco insurance are covered, but at a low price.
This type of contract means that the customer must pay part of the amount caused by the injury itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the principal representative of Spain at First Europe, a intermediary company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance which insures the customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic tariff in the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and their yields.
If the company has a profitable year behind it can allow it to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most useful to decide for a full-risk insurance with self-occurrence.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish head of the European company and adds that the majority of the accidents occur during the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been taken place.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete a full-risk insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person.
Since the insurers, couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore low are their contribution payments.
In this case, full-risk insurance would be the best option (with a amount of EUR 300). In the case of a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of vehicles.
They are driving more relaxed and have a larger purchase power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera finds.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete full-risk insurance with self-investment (with a amount of 150 euros) or to complete an advanced insurance that is only used with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against potential accident damage, but also because it is high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan at the point for the Achtelfinale
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on the next Tuesday in San Siro for the point that is missing for them to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Championsleague round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while it decides on their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team has already five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a dispute in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not pick up the Beffia Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth play round, as the FC Milan has to join the FIFA World Championship in Japan, where it will be the first time to fight on the 13th in the semi-final for the entry into the final which will take place on 16th.
Thus this group will be completed before all others and the distinctive in Guiseppe Meazza Stadion will be the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltic Glasgow know that they would have a better starting position in the Achtelfinale in the case of a victory group first.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even in a slack of the FC Shakhtar defeat a defeat to qualify. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because at nine points equality the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the e-mailers will try to miss the shots on the evening. Again, they hope to reach the eighthfinale of the transformed championsleague for the second time in the following, after they were defeated in the preceding game season in exactly the same round through a gate of cake in the retirement time (1-0) and by a zero to zero indefinitely on the Hinspiel.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as the achievement of the eighteenfinal as well as its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could gain the third place by a victory and thus join the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of Spice Girls tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave in the Canadian Vancouver in the eyes of 20,000 spectators the start shot for their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of her concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that it was excellent in the reunited band.
About 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the out-saled stadium, where a video was shown on the story of the band that had been provided for birds at the end of the nineties.
The reunification and the world tournament are crossed by the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hit and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, and which appears in Spain under the label of the EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls carried golden armbands on the stage, which had previously given them to the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses of the audience that led the GM Palace to glory, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the past days.
During the preparations for the shoe, Victoria Beckham stated that the British star has not seen our garderobe once, and so I'm very excited about what he's going to think of the appearance.
Sporty Spice , whose exit from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later the dissolving of the group, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world publicity had changed, that the feelings had changed to the spice girls.
And so I thought why not, so I am pleased to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed itself on the separation of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also argued that the disputes were eliminated and now everyone was very happy again.
Yet, many things have changed since the last common appearance of the spice girls in 1998.
At first, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special machine from the Virgin Airlines, report by the CTV.
When she arrived at the airport, the band was received from a army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th December).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price struggle swells between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe are affected.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are guided by Ukraine and each conflict between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the gas, it will be charged higher transit fees by Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced delivery to the EU countries.
The recent conflict between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be calculated more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additionally for gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation," said the Ukrainian economic minister Anatoli Chinakh of Reuters news agency.
"The change in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments on the level of transit fees [to western Europe] over Ukraine."
In January 2006, Gazprom's delivery to Ukraine was shortened in the last major gas fight between Moscow and Kiev.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements his own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-punishment registers of workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns about the fact that the Scottish State Health Service did not give any precise ideas about the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28th, a Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a landing car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transmission, and was stressed in connection with the suspected autobombing attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service shall carry out controls in front of the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify pre-punishment registers, the Agency does not have the power to obtain such information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the main auditor's report now states that the Board should take up guidelines for the jurisdiction of the criminal register, which help employers in controls in various countries.
"Though we have found evidence of these checks in some personal documents, these have not been routinely carried out." said the report.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their inquiry directives with a high degree before employment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information is available about the number of foreign healthcare workers."
BMA Schotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the preliminary context of hiring potential NHS employees would identify people who might be taking the future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it says that current preliminary tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign employees, the majority of their doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the boards had problems identifying those employees who were allowed at an indefinite time.
The investigation continued that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mainly followed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification controls.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines on controls prior to the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "It was a concern to me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It supplemented that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on checks in the preliminary field of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, would reflect their publication next month.
Joy Division dominates film price leasing
Control, the film biography over the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has collected five prices at British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best movie.
Prices were also given to the main actors of Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of the Curtis, to the director Anton Corbijn, and to Toby Kebbell.

The price for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafia champion in David Cronenberg, London, Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation hard to play, has picked up the Richard Harris price for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old films of Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beest are currently filming the Indiana Jones continued The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the price named to the honor of the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney, who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actress of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group, including filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terror complot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 military forces because of their belonging to cells that had planned a future attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathisants of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a associate of the United States since 2003, due to the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, given by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong railway troop to protect plants after a misleaded Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested were part of a cell led by a "raket expert" who illegally emigrated into the country.
He reports that the military had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Other 22 of the inmates had, according to the report, to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis who strives for Iraq to join Al Qaida military, who wants to fight the Allied Army and the US-supported Shitish Muslim Government, which is considered ceterical by the Hardliners under the Sunitian Saudi.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia standing in collaboration with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The military - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, aimed at the pro-western Saudi government - has been excluded from foreign residential areas, government buildings and plants of the energy sector.
"This was a great effort for the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior informed the state television.
The arrests also concern a "mediacy cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at advertising "Takfiri Think" - the ideology of radical Sunitian Muslims, who supports violence against Muslims, which are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the military.
The climate on the Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once be a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a circuit show that the planet is even more like a distorted twin of the earth than was aware of so far.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary paths, but the Venus of the sun is somewhat closer.
billions of years ago had ruled on Venus conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable, believes scientists today.
However, because of the unbremsed carbon dioxide driving house effect, the erosion of the atmosphere through sun-instrahling and a slower rotation rate, the Venus started a very different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has an surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space zone, which has examined plants for a year, provide an indignant view of how the earth could develop in view of the disastrous climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that of the earth, while the planets are quite similar."
"Our new data allow us to construct a scenario in which the Venus started billions of years ago like the earth, possibly with an inhabitant environment."
"Enriched Uran" enclosed by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, as reported by enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said three people were arrested and the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Everything still open
Meanwhile, Romey said he was not worthy of a presidential candidate to be consulted by a Schtagann.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally declared himself ready to set up a debate on YouTube, to take up and submit questions on video in the normal voters to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Schtagenann, the democratics asked about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected precisely the state of the Republican Party, which breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the YouTube Clips to show the candidates to show.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest of which was devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most striking topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecisive voters to use a choosing disc when they heard things that they liked: The television department noticed the tops of consent when the candidates were strictly speaking about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national precursor, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation that he was inferior to illegal immigration when he was the Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to have set up illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly strongly distinguished as a questioner, whether one of the candidates would support an amnesty (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unimportant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congress delegate, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress delegate from Colorado, managed to emphasize this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have been hoping on the immigration pauk earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share generally the same views: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, together with anxiety about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
However, the debate has clearly been addressed as a problem than other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered to be torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to see whether Jesus would support them, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extraordinary open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa, together with Ron Paul's latest donations and his contests in the debate on Wednesday.
These two have been shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a victory to both of the wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another grub to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slim.
No noble titles seem to be sold, no politician of Paris's hotel bills paid to have not been lured out of marriage.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has swallowed donations to the British Government Labour Party over $650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without what the controversy Gordon Brown would have done well.
When the Prime Minister had abandoned the demand for a election two months ago, the British intelligence in a dumb way, claiming that opinions had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Rather, as Vince Cable, the increasingly clever chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The unhealthy salvation of Northern Rock, a struggled bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgment under the shot.
Malformed proposals to amend tax laws have set up corporate associations against the government.
The loss of personal data by the tax authorities of 25 million people showed unprecedented administrative moulds.
A trio of generals in retirement launched an opposition in the upper house of protest against reductions in military expenditure: to be military minister, they claimed to be part-time job.
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and their former supervisor) has already retired.
Nothing of this means that Brown breaks inevitable direction of departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel it impossible to rule.
Neither people may trust politicians, but they usually stop their skepticism when a new troop takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he doesn't even need to be there for a long time, this is over: the public service begins to become uncommon; the cabinet minister begins to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and goalless.
In some ways, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because, in contrast with other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new besen.
If he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his chief lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax competence documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown took as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's misconducts - as with the long "guilt for noble titles" examination of political party funding - the voters may assume that he was it.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or has been completely dirty.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns, of course, has always promised stalinistic tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new custody for political donations is a good example.
The Garboetic Abraham, who compares his donations with his generous gifts, he wishes no public recognition for his well-being.
That may be the case, but the decision on this was not allowed for him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who said he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial operator, which was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved to date: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grewing by a well-known instrument, a investigation committee on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and by a judge.
In this case, the "to draw out" teachings are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition to this, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, as to find something a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in the public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and progress with a thorough reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly quit the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party companion like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinions; he has two years to recover electors; and the only way to achieve a victory is by incontemplable justice and solid competence.
Card Shake
Does the credit crisis turn on America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that back flaps revolve excitedly around.
Now that America's real estate market is broken, the robbers have the country's credit card market in vision.
Analytics of Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could achieve $99 billion if the risk of inflammation of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the bookings and in the seam rates that measure the share of loans which are not incurable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took a $1.4 billion fee survey from its American consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card users.
It's still too early to get paniced.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quartal sea rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The worsening of the Councils can, in part, be explained by technical factors.
A change in the US Private Insolvency Law in 2005 led to a sudden case of bankruptcy applications, which, in turn, constitute a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus summit fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors are worsening or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates showing how much of its debts the consumer pays every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stop in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volumes of expenditure for 2007 will last be 25% higher than last year.
There is certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers are taking credit card debts, now that private credits are drying out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the flow of money instead of at capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily resolve a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of advantage to the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the hypothesis rates decrease if the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts under the priorities of return become more important.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and flexibler than credit providers to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main financial reference.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable reduction are significantly realer.
If lower house prices and a reduction in loans in America are pressing into the recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more vicious future.
Keep them looking for these sharks.
British bankers confession guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be put before the court for their role in the deceitful system with the former principal financial leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search in debt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded innocently for seven cases of fraud used by telecommunications for supposed conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was initiated on January.
But during a hearing before the court before the US District Court of Justice Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation initiated after Enron's crash in 2001.
The accusations initially lodged against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the objective of an investigation by the government related to the Enron decline.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to expose a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership by Enron, controlled by Fastow, the architect of numerous fraudulent Enron teams that contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had significant value.
A company under koper control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the charge Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper, and other about $12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004 Fastow declared himself guilty in two accusations of conspiracy for his role in Enron's plague.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a six-year prison prison in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Copper suspends a three-year penalty and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot on the basis of a $1 million deposit, which required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookholding tricks no longer could cover the billion debts or make weakening businesses seem profitable.
The breakdown destroyed thousands of jobs, over 60 billion market value and over $2 billion pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron breakdown.
Skilling delays a penalty of over 24 years.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were invalid after he died last year because of heart disease.
Not completely below in Moscow
The price of a plane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a rolls royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand on the last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgie from the showed consumer, which was organised in a narrow exhibition centre at the city edge of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibitions, hoping to interest new Russians in everything, from mahagoni-taped yachts to diamond-drawn car grills, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Fourers carefully took a shiny orange porch at the next fair stand into the vision.
"This is a beautiful car, but it's small money in comparison with us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be as flooded with money as Dallas at its glorious times.
"We walked through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Europe in the crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible editions of money in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold noise.
Anderswo in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has been attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-prise goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, belonging to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are part of the second class, which are a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts in the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15,8 percent of Russians lived under the Minimum of Existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London Jewelier.
She had visited the fair for the first time with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary, and the men are all worth an asset."
While they move Sunday night in evening clothing through the halls, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who was delivering the designer clothes she was wearing, like a red carpet-veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to be aimed at the new ranges, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in stock several hours to visit a occupied warehouse, which unpleasantly put Cadillac Escalades, pocket measuring from Platine, Mövenpick Eiskrem, tailored Billiardtics, Appartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears next to each other.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning the most expensive and best brand," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patrioticly at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a wall-size imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climper climbers."
In fact, traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years after Russian standards are old) have already moved from great track logos to the type of neat brand with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Yet several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said that he had sold two $70,000 matratzensets made of silk, cashmir and cotton, with enclosed golden vessels.
Similarly, in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a selling manager for A1 Moto, a company offered high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the grill orange porch for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said that he had sold three car refrigerators for a rolls-Royce Phantom, which is similar to each other to kettle moulds, for each $55.000.
He showed a reporter a car math developed for a Russian casino owner, with moistures he had covered with coloured Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a routine ad.
The costs: $22,000 for a four-replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, the Straußen Leder wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic circonium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will store it in his 30 or 40-waves garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would currently not express much exclusiveity in view of the rise in the real estate prices.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on the paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich in a position operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were fully stopped with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his staff had expressed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the cash hopes, mobile photos, while they rejected in the middle of replacement, let friends blink, or simply for a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Premature surgery suspected by death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Harvest Thanksgiving Festival as Ronald Livingston through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched as a nursing car at the White Cape Cod held two doors further down at the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical body viewer arrive," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"This was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead wife Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the detectives are trying to find out whether she died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet detected what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that sent a grief through the headquarters of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo has been a assistant of the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and harsh," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the alcohol control mission and leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a step daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that researchers would try to determine whether Arroyo died as the result of an unauthorized surgery treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in November afternoon.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared in the place for death.
More than one week has passed and the authorities have not informed much about their investigation or about the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The detectives are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where there is a blurred rose bar in the tough front garden and a Dalmatine belt behind the house.
A blue barrel described with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanillas in food and parfums - sat in the parking area next to a door that led into the underground.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after 25 years spent with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him to remedy himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or those," he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Central Bank will reduce interests lead to an increase in world share markets
The stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to reassure the credit markets by further interest reductions, strengthened by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Central Bank, said that the policy "flexible and pragmatic" must respond to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure devastating markets, in view of signs of rising credit tensions, Koohn said that the latest turbulencies had "partially reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increase in turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further reinforcement of the financial conditions for consumers and companies, he said.
The comments were recorded by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to intervene and with new capital sprays into the US markets and possible further interest reductions to stabilise the credit conditions.
The statements also helped to calm the Wall Street, in view of other bad news from the US economy, now as the sale of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulencies were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide workers, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for severe losses from their lost bets in the US hypothesis credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industry Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289,40, while the broader-based S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to conclude at 6.306,2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standards.
Germany's Dax Index increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The reappearance of credit pressure on the markets had previously been underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantees granted to the European Central Banks was granted to the European Trade Banks to considerably 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to eat other capital funds into the money markets in London increased when the credit voltages saw the three-month "Libor" rates for loans between UK banks with 6.59 per cent rising to its highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faces a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to hit England as number 6 this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the elections, is here at least under this special title, to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English business leader, is gradually filling with applications for national electors, if not even for which in part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unrighteous and sports is without doubt.
It is never easy to strike precisely what enables a person to reach the top of his professions, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest range, sometimes because of a lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good conclusions that know the business well, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities have this too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a hitter must get regular chances of order if he wants to make impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season better than, for example, than James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind boils into the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hopes for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium, can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still fighting at that time to fix himself, which created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and which, although he pointed a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah's more experience about Boparas youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion in the course of today's network session at Asgiriya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his thrilling and valuable 88 test debt in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indians in the test in Lord, his homeatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take his position back for the next game, seems to have taken the turn from his battles, which was still obviously in Bombay.
In contrast, Essex's all-classian has great joy in life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket square and his attitude beyond it was taken to the point when he had recently surpassed a four-wheel vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodaphone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from the distance, and with enthusiasm saying, "Have you seen it?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he boils his middle speed with some effect here on the fields that seem to fit to him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe that's the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government conference of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Saba Al-Qubaisi, a Sunitian doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, as regards the militant clergy militant Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his powers to return at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiitian teacher from the principal Sunnitic part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraqer is not allowed to work.
His Shiitian neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local military supported by the United States has contributed to deploying Al-Qaida from their basement in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunitian and Shitian tribe who had been displaced from his house in Slekh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with handgranates after he had invited his fellow citizens to combat Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called on me and told me that they started one of the Anti-Al-Qaida Miliz in Slekh and that they need my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told them that they had been locked by the increasing rest in the capital since the US troops increased and the growth of local "groups affected" citizens who armed and, in cooperation with the U.S. military, defended their city districts.
However, more spoke of being forced home by visa problems and decorating money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqians have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-fold father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, who had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the seccurities of death swadrons in the country.
"We went well to visit Al-Maliki Syria, and the government urged the Iraqi no longer to give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunitian retirer.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnite was displaced from Shitian residential areas and reversed, which led to the creation of many places where tensions left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will restore sectaric tensions and conflicts will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading in vocational training and even shiny with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saar countries press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I declared for the 50th time yesterday to a non-Saarland that we are not French" - this slogan places the smallest federal country self-initial on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is located in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economy of Cologne (IW).
Thus the universities are already working closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can complete their study with a double or even three-fold diploma.
Therefore, the share of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
But the country children also bring the Saarland to the universities in an over-mean number - many of them without a graduation at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Pünncke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his study rights at a professional school, thus the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training opportunities have also been very strongly expanded.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practice training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineer graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
Thus, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences.
"We came to the general educational schools after the first Pisa study several reforms," says a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government conducted country-wide comparison tests.
In order to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the benefits of the students are sustainablely improved, future comparison studies will only show.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk schools decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
In total, however, the Saarland did not grow as strong as other states.
The Bayern's better calculated.
And for the sake of the Saar countries, foreign language skills will not be measured at Pisa - in this area you might otherwise point.
For the language of the neighbors is obligated to gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks are almost different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez turns the timemes in the South American country back half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela noted, a new law states that clocks are set at world time minus four and a half hours.
So the South American State gets a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez founded his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had imposed the division in time zones for full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage.
The left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not talk to the Head of State or to the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who prompts a constitutional reform which the citizens of the Alandes must vote on on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe was criticized by Chávez on Sunday with his decision "in the face".
Chávez is also in all mouths in Spain.
A new mobile phone cable provides birds in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He spoke of the Spanish King Juan Carlos, who was geniused at the recent Ibero America summit of the constant intermediate calls of the left-populist and drove this over the mouth.
German threatens wage minus 2007
Despite the strong conjunction, German workers are threatening a real loss of wages this year.
Experts called a whole series of reasons for their pessimistic forecasts.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could actually expect less on the wage account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomy and Economic Research of the "Photo-Photo-Pointing" said, "is due to the moderate wage development, the increase in VAT and the price sharing in food and energy."
New burdens could also result in unemployment insurance on workers.
Financial Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent in the change of the year is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants, the SPD policy has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it was known that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has been driving inflation rates at the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the hellic twin of the earth
Despite its violent atmosphere of the earth, the Venus has been more similar than ever thought: The European space sun "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind spines on the Poland, as they occur in winter on earth.
For almost three decades, scientists suspect that it is flashing on the Venus.
Now the European Son "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on the Venus shoots in a height of approximately 56 km from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Orsuppen Theory", lightning has caused life to come up on earth: Thunders are supposed to have stimulated in the ocean reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there ever was life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon by the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of the Venus, there should be little living: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on earth, it is sometimes under temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil willing of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has embarked on such a whole different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties there has been no more sin in the research of this planet.
The latest research results now presented in several "Natur" articles, according to the researchers, not only underline the uniqueity of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbouring planet with the earth are larger than initially accepted," the Esa informs.
Thus, alongside the already known spinal wind on the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud trumpet on the South Pole, which is even swifter.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earth's winter hemisphere, a research team writes about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-mindest planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet also referred to as the morning or evening star cries around the sun in nearly 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venus day takes 243 earthdays.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, waters that remained on the earth in oceans, but Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate stones, it is the most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Köhler defends Merkels meetings with the Dalai Lama
President Kohler demands the end of the party dispute about the reception of Dalai Lama in the office of the Kanzler.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's view and has called on the great coalition to end the fight to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outside world in this issue a divided nation," said Köhler to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Kohler signaled understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the variability of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany needs to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the claim, she operates a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken advantage of the traditional single-China policy.
This also knows China," said Kohler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly demonstrated immotion about the reception of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier had among other things complained about the Union's window policy in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lamas was received in the office of the Kanzler, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD) to freeze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the two foreign ministries, according to the information of SPIEGEL.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the Dalai Lamas was received as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians receive the religious leaders of the Tibetans in official function, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he attempts to split Tibet and the other Tibetan region, including other provincies today, from China.
Shüble warns against crabs like in France
Road battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Shüble warns against crabs like in France.
All things must be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany should not be exposed to violence in the streets, the Federal Minister of Inner Affairs asked.
Barrikadas burned, Randalians shot on the police with scrotflies: After the severe youth cruels in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We need to ensure that we do not also build social explosives and discharge in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person is dealing with the rapid change in social reality.
Alliances, countries and municipalities were already working on reducing problems, said Schüble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference, the first success already shows."
However, it would be too early for warning.
Shüble also pointed out that in German suburbs there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France.
In the northern premises of Paris, young people have been in the last nights of heavy street struggles with the police.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
However, greater integration efforts from the Federal Government demanded the President of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalls in France, Colat warned against "nachahming effects".
The situation in Germany is not as big as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background below 25 years was "averagely high".
In particular, more training needs to be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give youths a perspective."
However, the Chairman of the Turkish municipality added, in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families takes place".
Moreover, many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Colat admonished: "But we still have to watch out."
You need to give youths "a quick chance of participating in work and training".
In the meantime it remained largely quiet in the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of cops were in operation, a helicopter flooded over the area with shiners.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and a few burning waste and cars.
Since the morning, an order of approximately 1,000 security forces provides rest.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary to announce Michelle Alliot-Marie after a visit to the suburb.
In the night on Tuesday, Krawalls in Villiers-le-Bel had been injured about 80 policemen.
In the following evening, the disturbances overcome Toulouse.
The Krawalls were infected by a traffic accident where two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first facts of the lawyer, the police do not blame the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Cloud
The reality-distance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is contently at the end - and that there is no expectation from herself.
In what country does this federal Chancellor actually live?
After their unbelievable appearance in the General debate of the Federal Day, which was rude and poor of content, you must say, not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
The assumption that she focuses too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an angry sentence.
It was provincial, she said, and she first showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics are about.
On the federal day, she documented for everyone the extent to which their allegations were applied.
There was no specific interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented himself: a rejected politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in caution even there.
Example of climate protection: As it commends itself unheartedly for the decisions of Holy Damm, but does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
Overall, the self-lobby - so much insignificance would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she sticks to the flashes that the rise is coming to the people.
So she damages her image as a pragmatician who solves the problems instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the empire of Angela Cloud, internal political problems are a peripheral appearance.
Children's poverty and the concerns of the low-deservants?
She's got a few additional sets left for it.
It is an indication of how often she promises when it comes to the child’s surgery.
Three arrivals need Merkel to get out a half straight sentence.
It's stumbling like on a foreign territory when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attack
In the YouTube debate of the Republican Presidency candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivering a tough exchange of battles - and now have to fear an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already available in the first topic.
He made New York a "refuge place for illegal immigrants" in mid-Romany prompt his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He recits with serious allegations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," against Giuliani, proposing the former governor of Massachusetts to have occupied private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blaze to attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidential advocates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-scrolled 30-second videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than labels.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain proposes his counterpart Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets strongly read by the Vietnam Veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drunkenness as torture.
The fact that the key topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq War and torture debates, however, shows the reactions of the hall public in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditory burns up applause.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I was mistaken at that time," explained Romney, interfering with the base and the television audience for he was still part of the abortion advocates in 1994.
On the other hand, Giuliani comes into slingering when he thinks he is asked to interpret the Bible literally.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian
One day after his retirement as army chief, the Pakistanian power holder Musharraf has been defeated as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been defeated on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistani television was a ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had surrendered his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, with international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his captivity in a unblooded military pussy, the former General is now for the first time ruled as a civil state chief.
Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand for opposition and west with his withdrawal as commander of the armies.
Another central requirement is the end of the exception that Musharraf had infringed on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf, according to General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will withdraw the exceptional state and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the State, who had occupied the Musharraf after the suspension of the exemption at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections against the controversy of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
At the same time, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribe region of Northern Asia in an attack on a military convoi and four more injured.
According to a army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's super group of seventy musicians again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles up again at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival appears a medal from their great time "Life 1974".
Already at that time they were far more famous in abroad.
The advocate sensation will then take place in the shape of three set men at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of himself, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius throne in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and possessed laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, turns to the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band remusts Harmonia has provided some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: targeted demands revealed that, although the name sweared through the collective pop memory, it has not been so sustained to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should the German not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Especially what is called misleading Krautrock, in England and America was always more true than in their own country.
When the music economy gave the echo prize for the life work to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003, they saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the Bands La Düsseldorf and New in the Laudatio, the admiration was unfavorable.
At concerts Michael Rother later cooked the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignore at home and the V declaration in the stranger is one.
The memory has already been exaggerated with Harmonia because the Trio existed only two years and also developed a far lower power than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label that the church entertained.
Rother had shortly helped with power plants and then played a reputation as a guitarist at New!, perhaps the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-flying Communists.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to suffer as a child girl.
Previously in an artificial fashion.
It is said that in the garbage, a vimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein Association was a name for the art.
Some have held Harmonia on it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For so left and modest the music sounded also, the band suffered material need.
The rice collection was not for self-finding alone.
The now published CD "Live 1974" was cut into a concert in Griessem, in front of a nearly 50-headed record score, as somebody believes to feel.
At that time, Rother wanted to force Harmonia and sometimes practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoterian spheres and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming hearts".
Cluster was relived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than it was ever.
The Griessemer Live Album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its plate company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an original German contribution to living music.
New! has already been buried like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, in the context of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and author of the Handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
The whole bandwidth of the influences of the Krautrock would be rounded to the following pop music.
Harmonia is filled with the space of the supergroup.
The phrase of Brian Eno swoops with the most distinct sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the farming room.
The legendary formation serves projections of other black-white photos of wirer cabled devices.
Before that, the three veterans are reconsidered with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the tape to unhearted sounds of the instruments through self-based instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technically deepened tuber.
There is no change in the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morning Stars, sound clouds are hedged and whispered and songed at a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were searched less in the blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (kraftwork) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not able to calm out of it even now.
Still the most obvious is thoroughly thought on the stage.
Where starts music and when does it stop?
This can rob your nerves or bring you great happiness in refugee moments.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Morderic Peace" are again discussing two films with the Balkan War.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and balls or they are too comfortable.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Though the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark back of the Bosnia War, the actress Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost the most beautiful man in the eighty years last out of the eyes because too many nice-important roles in well-feeling films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism drew out the desire to look at them.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to "The Hunting Party - When the hunter is being hunted" (Why must movie titles actually always be as long today and we're like Lokführer's tariff contracts?) may be looking at.
He delivers a wonderful eye-shaping representation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become from Gere if the fate and the film industry would not be so graceful: a man who has long been behind his best times, but who himself as a ruin-like monument of his decline still preserved considerable remains of the ensty charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production of "Mordic Peace", which also begins this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan War films.
With "Morderic Peace" you can make a short process: the film deals with two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a serbian from cosovarian heck shooters, which one is still in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbians are not once represented as the sole root of all evils, the remote film loses too quickly in geballer and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a motorway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be examined exemplaryly why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The history of three US war reporters who are opening up to discover the Serbian Colonel Criminal Criminor "the Fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at a different time, with another director and one other acting book author (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are quite like this: Both times small teams go to the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot do and both times it becomes a trip to the crazy.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply left the downcoming cynics with a heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to have another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnier.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the bach when the reporters managed what NATO, CIA and all the world's headguard hunters did not in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge.
This is so bad that you would like to call the International Court of Justice in the Hague for crimes against Kinology.
The film has a deepest human concern.
He wants to claim that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be unanimously agreed) not too intensely to persecute persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good mixed and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes into mind.
This says about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "I see the swollen stirrs with compassion: how hard it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swellheads, but they indicated how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's great floods.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star runs around on the crisis flocks or mining fields of the world, then it comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Over all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamants" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All the conflicts may be too close to time.
It had to pass decades before Hollywood with "Schindler's List" could turn a good film about the Holocaust.
Some films are probably still mature - the Vietnam works that are now considered as classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unholy as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder comes home on equally two monitors, even too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the writers of the turnbooks the unawareness it needs to tell good stories.
"Shine or nonsense" or "The Great dictator" have eventually become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically distant artist view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was consulted on parallels between his historic novel "Lemprière's dictionary" and the Balkan War, he answered: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and always will rule war in Yugoslavia."
From Beast Harvested Criticism for Olympia Cancellation
The decline of the Mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has been strong criticism in politics and economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Beast realism admonishes when assessing the chances.
The principal business leader of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, referred to an absence on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as much motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaide.
"Without this objective, sporting policies could not be maintained in the same manner."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to buried the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "the basis of a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in previous statements that the Olympic Ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an olympia application, but the German Olympic Sports Association," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He refers to the decision of the Sportsbond on an application of Munich for winter games expected for early December 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the so far planned period until 2028."
Yet, the dream was not cleared for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by buriing the plans at this time," said President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A rejection of the application is also contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate at the time of receipt of the full meeting of the German High School Association.
There Beust called Hamburg's application for the university 2015 "not a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD citizenship fraction was preparing to the Senate to have not used valuable time for the housing building in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map Olympia and put out the apartment building," said the SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the little Grasbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later living use, the CDU has set on the "Event factor" unilateral.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games had provoked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed to Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's boxes
Who combines the terms of Sweden and the wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, crafted wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's work list.
Most of the four and ninety Brillo boxes of the "Type of Stockholm" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Express" a few months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxen in 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to an indignant result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made to the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the more of the "Type of Stockholm" brillo boxes that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is confused, a confusion of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", painted wooden boxes, based on the red-blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made hundreds of Brillo boxes from paper: These were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not artworks, it was their models, just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol must have granted the permit in 1968 to produce a few Brillo cabins in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museum.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then authorized as original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes called "Type Stockholm" rightly entered in the art and auction history.
Some of them have achieved over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it was produced in 1968 about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were produced in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg until 1990.
Warhol had been dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museum, has also examined three of them from Swedish private possessions, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm: their press plates were first founded and smuggled, then white oil with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of copies from 1990 suggests that the color with a painter roll without foundation was placed directly on the press plate - it is also not oil but acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not conclude another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in his collection as copies/exhibition materials."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that he should check the "severe accusations" raised in the soap powder boxes.
But since then, it has been indefinitely silenced there.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up

They entered the Peninsula hotel and called for the crash of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the leading hotel.
The President invited an urgent meeting of the Security Capital.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously commanded the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march soon.
Government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption claims for months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the attempted muitery of about 200 military members against Arroyo in 2003.
The resurrection failed after nearly 24 hours when the army refused to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven putch attempts against democraticly elected governments in the Philippines.
