Members of the Wales Congregation worried they're going to look like fools.
There are arts among some members of the meeting on the proposal to change their title of AMs to MWPs (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the political spectrum are afraid that it can provoke a ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "it with TWP and Pwp rim."
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means discharge.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of fool or fool.
In this context, the Wallish letter w is expressed as the Yorkshire-English statement of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which currently designed legislation to set up the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called meeting members, of course will be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Wallish meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals received widespread support to call the meeting a Wales Parliament.
As regards the AM's title, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AMs seem to be proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who in weeks must present a legislative proposal on the changes.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the way the meeting works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last saying in the question of what they should be called when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change in country’s name
Electors will vote Sunday or their country's name must change to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to remove a decades of dispute with neighbouring Greece, who itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens already demands for a long time that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim in its field and repeatedly made capture against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's get silent because churches in Harlem are struggling.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to were there a bar and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"No one of the two is more there today."
He says that the disappearance of crowns is understandable.
"Mens today socialize in other ways," he said.
"Crues are no longer the family rooms of neighborhoods where people go regularly."
As regards churches, he is worried that the money is not going to keep out of sales as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will bring the day these churches completely closed even closer, because most of the people who enter into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation who worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boikot from retailers in the 155th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carilo.
Eerw. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at Saint Martin's, proudly called the karilion "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the carilion in July mentioned it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a unreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's hasn't replaced him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some introduced by the league leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal bisdom.
The church council, the congregation's control body, consisting of league leaders - wrote to the bisdom in July with concern that the bisdom "try to transfer the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bisdom.
Some members of the congregation complain about a shortage of transparency from the bisdom’s side.
Hawk hurt 13-year-old on crawl diving in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and hurts when he dug for crawl on the first day of the crawl season in California, says officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was dying with friends for a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cried for help and then robbed with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first crawl catch, but then he realized "that he called, 'I was bite!
I'm bite!"
All his key bone was broken up," saw Hammel when he came out to the son.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known what shark species is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media information session that a shark was noticed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it wasn't a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had experienced traumatic injuries at the upper part of his body.
Officers closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for inquiry and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan for enlargement to the United Kingdom Beauty Market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Super Drugs, and Debenhams fight with department shop type beauty courses managing by specialist assistants.
As part of a large enlargement in the UK’s £2,8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home products fall, the larger beauty courses will be tested across the country in 11 stores and if it is a success next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill flocks once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury's say that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bee will also get more place with trademark specific areas similar to those that are seen in shops like Boats.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique array again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that increasingly younger buyers demand.
In addition, the parfume dealer, The Fragrance Shop concessions will test in two Sainsbury's shops, of which the first last week in Croydon in South London opened and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local comfort shops means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops will look more like department shops when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's have placed Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also published a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains two years back, which, according to their herbal sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint company with boats in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how the profit from the pharmaceuticals should be divided within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 shop of pharmaceutical occupation for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering a wide range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be next to provide advice.
Our series of trade names were designed to provide every need and the intriguing environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now an area of beauty that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'would' after Holly Willoughby withdrawn from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones walked away 'wrathful' after the TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrawn her to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trademark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home clothes-and-addition trade name, Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
The This Morning provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing herself.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-Star Peter Jones wrathfully by at the last moment withdrawing their profitable lifestyle trading business - to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "indignant" when TV's gold girl on Tuesday at an excited meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new occasions - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she can no longer spend enough time on their home clothing and additional trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a radiator and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority at far.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her through the coming few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was totally stupid to all those involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the release.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that stand right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that make most money flow in, can chase the company millions out of the pocket because of the huge investment in products stretching from coasts and candles to clergy and home clothes, and the possibility that its advertisement may even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples keep vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to become a trademark embassy for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard words "and then we get in love"
He was ridiculing about criticism that he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his camema-"News Reader voice."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a great step to the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned in.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June Chief Assembly in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding reaction" from the US on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S.A. continues penalties aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impression in his convention talk.
"We progress excellent with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have resulted in positive results - it ended firepile tests, helped to liberate hostages, and causes the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into 'this stampful arena, we would have had almost 200 people standing there," said Trump while he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Changolf and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island, death hundreds
In the follow-up of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations have been said they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were displaced, no national disaster was announced, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they don't ask international help, which makes it a little difficult," said me. Sumbung.
Although saving the Children are compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the land remains sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis were built in Aceh, it is not a general vision on other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning sirene in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of power.
It is most challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s fragmented infrastructure a core point of his choosing campaign and poured money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is struggled with funding deficiencies as he faces reselection next year.
Mr. Yoko also stands before the pressure of slaughtering sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim Majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands of unthemed like Christian and Muslim gangs with capmes, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge shot good equator against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported to Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he shot far to the target stake.
The effort sealed high over the frame as it swooped to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball thumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, to come to the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Rande come and typed one time and didn't think too much about it and just shot."
Chelsea was 1-0 before at half the time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard set a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target captain played back to Mateo Kovacic again in that playground before he told near the middle field and in the Liverpool half engineered.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head, he then led for Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended with a left foot-head past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the best target net.
Liverpool runs the fight against Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europe League before Videoton.
Deaths rise to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death count in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed up to 832, said the country’s disaster agency Sunday early.
It was reported that many people were caught under the waste of buildings that hit the earthquake, which had caught at Friday at a range of 7.5, broke together, and caused burners of up to 20 feet, the Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was poured with the ruin of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests man, 32, suspected of murder after the death of a woman
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead this morning, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area who heard or saw anything to move forward.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is in a early stage, but I appeal to anyone who was in the surroundings of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything on dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to us.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Research is continued because the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Inhabitants are now said that it will take hours before they are released.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area is now treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, 'It's so awful.'
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car outside.
A number of officers were left within the cordon to monitor the block apartments.
Anybody with information is asked to switch @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or link Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of September 30 as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial with 'rewrite of history'-twist
His exile will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects carried out by his fanatic purite followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sotness" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the design of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagestorming of the English civil wars was not yet commanded by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's man-made imagination of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believes is still worthy of anniversary.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarch.
Whether this is a completely accurate picture, is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is firmly that the conflict of the mid-17th century has given shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizeable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and anniversary."
Murd pig Exacerbated Chinese Boer
A farmer, according to local media reports, was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, who was only identified by his of, "Yuan," was found with a scattered stroke with blood covered death near a cave at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared on May 30, 2005 to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and found a door to a neighboring pig hockey open.
He said there was a great male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A Forensian investigation confirmed, according to the report, that the 550 pounds pig had biten the farmer dead.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said the cousin, who was called on the side of, "Wu," the Guiyng Evening News quoted.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man belongs not to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager said to the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although weird, cases of pigs that attack people have reported earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pounds pig had tightened a Walish farmer against his tractor until his wife had scared the beast.
After a farmer of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "snapper".
"They're just playing.
They're bitches, very curious, they're not looking for hurting you.
You should just show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Travel from Orcan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern U.S.A.
As foretold, Orcan Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m p.m. on Sunday from 5 a.m. Eastern time, a Category 1 orchestra, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a troop over the Pacific begins to take form and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa approaches the Baja California ski island as a tropical storm, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northwestern the southwestern US in.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical moisture in response to the approaching troop will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause hazardous floods, waste flows, and possibly soil crashes in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates from up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Kits floods may be with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to risk it at foot in the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - sealed rivers to be touched and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trog will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain rates of more than a half inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth railways.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some distributed tropical rainbuis will be late on Sunday and early Monday begins to approach before the rain late Monday, and Tuesday will be more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature complications across the US as cooling the Arctic, but the tropicals remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S.A. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, counting summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. October will begin warm, with widespread 80s from the Southern Layer to parts of the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher risk of bogus average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh question.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at the attractive witness of High Court Attendant Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political death point continued, with broadcasters that interrupt regular programs for Friday's on-the-picking turn: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford said to the Senate Legal Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh took her in drunkenness and tried to pull out her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate witness, said he was 100 percent sure that it had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewer number on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks before with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day’s trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued an explanation that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning on CNN and CBS where objectors screamed on him when he tried to take a elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood a few minutes with depressed eyes while CNN was alive figuratively telling his bad words.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the land the truth?
There was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued an explanation and went to the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered live hours later when the Legal Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would only do this with the mind that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, like what the Democratic minority requested.
Flake is partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterward, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump set up a FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accused critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political playback" with Britain's future and the undermining of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s First Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conserwative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview along the one with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should recover each other's tariffs' entirely ridiculous'.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death.
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-grade murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officers issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the stumbling.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-defilled WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His warranty was set at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The judicial exam office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday which says that the cause of death was a gun in the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's refugee task force, the State Police's crime laboratory, Southern University Police and District Citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athlete director Joe Alleva thanks for the area law application for his "your and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per match.
Friday morning, LSU basketball trainer Will Wade said the team in "battered" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you're worried about," said Wayde.
Vulcan spooked as on Mexico City
As from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital have reached.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after having picked up activity in the crater and registered about 24 hours 183 releases of gas and as.
The center monitored multiple drowns and shootings.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas car windscreens cover near Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sat 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a earthquake with a range of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalonian separatists before anniversary of independence voice
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independency protesters were confronted with unhealthy politics, and thousands joined in countermotions to remember the first Memorial of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for detention.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by unhealthy police, cooked them with eggs and poultry painting that caused dark dust clouds in streets that normally weave from tourists.
Later on the day, a dawn broke out, and the police had to use their knupples to keep the fighting in control.
In several hours, pro-independency groups sang on one tone "None forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionists' cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for small injuries caused in the processions, the local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independent region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but was celebrated by separatist Catalogues.
Electors voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those who had mainly shocked the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police in violent conflicts tried to prevent the voting at the voting rooms throughout the region.
Pro-on-dependency groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist conference with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we had been through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry of joy because they could vote but now stick us fast," he said.
Despite a vital but nail crap victory in regional selections last December, Catalonian pro-independency parties have struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders or in self-designed exiles or in pre-arrest arrest for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
"It becomes increasingly tense," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in prejudice since late last year, announced that he was going to stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car riding at home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after repeatedly a car drove to a house in Londonderry.
The insider expanded Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagdsingel.
Detective Bob Blemmings said that damage was placed at the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a time to the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers.
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston guarantees victory
Promoted Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose proved the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved to the second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed in the Prime Ministership without a wake and stands next week before the precursors of Heart, which is ahead of them eight points.
First Thursday, Rangers are hosts of Rapid Vienna in the European Liga.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unoverwhelmed loop in the division to six competitions, with head trainer Holt, who still hadn't tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston has lost chances of bot visitors
Holt's team must have gone ahead long before they had recorded a purpose, with their circulation that rangers had taken all kinds of problems on their neck.
SR broke through, but wore before the target hok, then AL could only play wide after he had approached and CH’s headhold met across the target hok.
The hosts were satisfied to let Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death toy.
And thus the decisive purpose came.
Rangers took a free head and Livingston created an event, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to shoot and sign a goal from the middle of the frame.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated but could not penetrate home defense, and target guard Liam Kelly was mainly unaware.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a turn of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by the feet of Rangers targeter Allan McGregor and Lithgow had written wide to escape still open game from Livingston.
Crossovers repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and stopped repeatedly, while two penalty yards — after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were rejected.
“Fenomenal” of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward job.
Their game style and manship have been almost unchanged since their return to the first place, but a lot of honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was giant with his maniphic defense order, while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they were unable to comply with those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could push through the home team, which is somewhat of a week's call for Rangers, which they find in middle division.
Erdogan get mixed receipts in Köln
There was Saturday (September 29) smiles and blue air when leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO alliances.
They had a failure on issues that include human rights, press freedom, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then to Köln to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000 strong crowd from gathering before the mosque but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurdish – also made their voices thick and both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as heroes and is caught out by others as an autocracy.
Deptford road accident: Bicycler dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London with a car involved.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and to inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus circuits were placed, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guardians in disturbance injured
Six guardians were injured in a rebellion at a high-security prison, said the prison office.
Revolution broke out at Sunday at 09:30 BST and is still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist-"Tornado guarders" were invited to handle the rebellion, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wings.
The guards were treated on the scene for small face injuries.
A Prisoner spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff has been deployed to pay attention to a continuing intent at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible for the police will be referred to and can stay longer behind tralies."
HMP Long Martin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief captain of the prison had received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, unfortunate officers were invited to pay attention to serious disorders during which billion - ball staff were attacked.
Orchestra Rosa Dry Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kits floods (Dry Areas Trek Maybe Benefit)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona, but it's exactly what can happen early next week if Orcan Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwest desert and brings quick flow risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued swift - flood wakes for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and be late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix observed in a twitter that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have preserved tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles from the AZ border."
The National Orcan Center's models foretell 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the US Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely receive 1 to 2 inches, with an isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the flood risk, Rosa’s rain is likely to be a blessing because the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of these rainfall will likely be beneficial, since the Southwest is currently living in a dry state.
According to the U.S. Drug Monitor, only more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme droughts, the second highest category,” reports weather.com.
First, Orcan Rosa’s road leads to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at orchestra strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler water in the Pacific, so her power decreases.
So it is expected that she will reach the country on Monday in the afternoon or evening against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Regenvaltotals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north of Mexico before it comes on Tuesday in early morning hours as a tropical depression to Arizona and then will move through Arizona and to southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected by Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the US Southwest," said the National Orcan Center.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening floods and ruin streams in the deserts and land displacements in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempts to kill
Three teenage sons a 20-year-old man was arrested, suspected of attempting to murder after a 16-year-old with a stiff injury was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he still is in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area overnight, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile pictures of what has happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'had suffered under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the graceless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "under the commonness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and defended and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed about her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most qualified legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican arrival at the middle-term selections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I'm standing," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "oppose and obstacle."
The first important procedure on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant said to CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with figures that continue to rise
At least 384 people were dead and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, said the authorities Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday in the city of Palu on the beach for a festival on the beach when burners of up to six meters (18 feet) broke up to the sunset on the beach, washed many away after their death, and destroyed all that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 range of earthquakes.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s disaster illumination agency GBPB during a information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it drew cars, stumps, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that were confused and crashed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershots still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in a area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant shake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres, and hotels crashed.
Bodys of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruin of buildings that crashed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missed.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage can be larger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a area called Donggala closer to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely obscured with no information" of Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not tell that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur image material shared on social media, a man at the upper floor of a building can be heard screaming to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes a wall of water hits the beach and slew buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused great power interruptions that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, stated authorities, but evacuated people still need foods and other basic essentials.
The city’s airport has been reopened for assistance efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
It is very bad.
Though World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where workers in ceiling shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they passed by scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even while assisting groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief, some complained that foreign supporters with many experiences were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks, and staff from overseas can only be started after the area of the disaster has been declared to national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it has not yet a status."
When the second night comes to Palu to Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad story line of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a riol pipe.
Sunday, rescue workers had saved a woman for two days under ruin was impressed with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national parachute team, set two of the missing fallscreen webs for the Asian Games that had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the fallscreen soil, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the fallscreen tissue community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach feast.
His messages, however, were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think it means the messages weren't delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 during refilling OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26.750 on Friday morning at a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was busy clearing an OTM in a entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man "going from behind the Brink's worker ran off" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects flying from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the interior.
Anyone with information about their identity needs to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Canyons West: Quicker Changes its name to Ye
Rapper Canyes West will change its name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had the nickname Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will announce his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of its current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'y'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with the radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
It was from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, YAY-Z, has already finished with or without a link sign and uppercase.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican newly chosen President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military power against civilians at the time of the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody remembrance against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelco Plaza "never use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on October 2, 1968 on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people died in a time when left-minded student movements posed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities move youth to gangs.
U.S.A. needs to double AI funding
With China that becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S.A. must double the amount it spends on research in this field, investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made CI announcements, even shortly the U.S.A. a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced last year their plan: they aim to be the number 1 in CI innovation by 2030.
"Dubble the KI budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S.A. and we are looking for the next break in KI," said Lee.
Double funding may double the chance that the next large CI performance will be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a KI system that had knocked the highest approved American Othello player and later he was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has given recognition to previous technology competitions of the US Government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government chairs, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporation west," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential persons from other universities to work at AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to help the U.S. KI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued their next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligency in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at entering partners from the industry and the academic world and the White House announced the formation of a Currency Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
With regard to the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in CI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, had not come under fire for months.
Macedonian vote in choice or country name change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum about whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", actions that would solve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, who has a province named Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a demand in the area and refused their authorisation to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and a boikot campaign made doubts about whether the arrival will meet the minimum 50 percent necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum letter reads: "If you are in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argued that it was a price that could be paid to pursue authorisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that came into existence from the crash of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the parabol of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentary members have said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a second-degradation in the parliament.
The State’s election commission stated that there were no reports of spaces at 1 p.m.
But the arrival was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko bring out their voices for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country’s name that will ban the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small hockey and drawn chairs before tents set up by those who go to the referendum boikot.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join up with our heads, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring very necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he delivered his voice.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "recognition of our future."
A survey published by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research last Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum — less than the required quantity.
Another survey carried out by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, arrival must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A relapse in the referendum will be the first serious relapse for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his purpose in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine target captain received a given at the middle field.
He went through between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defense before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target hok.
Then he pushed a gentleman to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the cage to send the ball for Aguero back, who used his right foot to knock the Brighton target mathew Ryan with a spark to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're happy that he signed a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premierliga fighting.
The purpose came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area at that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling to the far destination.
The Sky Blues predictor shot the ball into the net just before he was over the backline.

Scherzer wants to play corrupter against Rockies.
With the Nationals who are out of the play fight, there isn't much reason to force another start down.
But the always competing Scherzer wants to attack the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but just if there are still play implications for the Rockies, who have a single race-progress above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least achieved a promotor choice place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to fix their first division title.
"Though we play for nothing, we can at least play the competition knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me this year will stare in the face.
Why would I not want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their initial player for Sunday, but it is reported that it is beneficial to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a Thursday's cast-training session and will play on his normal rest-sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outlets in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his High Court Choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican arrival at the mid - term selections.
"All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing, and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this awful, awful radical group of democracies, you see it happen now.
And they are now determined to take back the power by using any possible way, one sees the commonness, the genius.
They don't care for whom they hurt, for whom they should walk to gain power and control; that is what they want, power and power; we will not give it to them."
Democracies, he said, are on a mission to "stand and obstacle."
"And a man sees it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "injured and insane and delicate and false."
He referred to the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - placed Dianne Feinstein, who received hard bound from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you made the document leak?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I wait one – it was really poor body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Worker party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerable to those who say what they think
When momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censur, it was not exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string Labour Party LP's who had been told that we were not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she resisted fearlessly against anti-semitism.
In my case, the movement of censur criticized me because I differed from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues that Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The Notification for the Nottingham East Worker Party Meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, this was exactly what was Friday’s AR meetings.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendlyer, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Worker Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began to expect me to make an U turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly — and that doesn’t really matter what I say — there is a tirade of blasphemy on social media that asks me not to be reelected, disappointment of politics from the core, and to tell me that I should not be in the Worker Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who look at a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never scared away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Worker Party should grow a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party becomes tighter.
In the last two years, I have had a lot of advice that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so pronounced and that I will then be "aye".
But I did not go into politics to do so.
Since I joined the Worker Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my state high school collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hide my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the movement on Friday, I can just say that with the country that sends off on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Worker party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my choosers, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political benefit will prevent me from doing what I believe in your best interest is.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr bo
Two late three may have lost the final outcome a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Teentent's Premiership competition of the day.
They are now at the top of the pointleer, the only inconquered team of the ten.
Finally, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who wore the home team, and trainer Peter Murchie has all the right to be content.
"We have so far been tested in our competitions and we are still inconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ear to Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow map for Scotland player Rory Hughes, which was made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count and Jason Baggot recorded an unintentional three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's front with a penalty head just before he meant a soloth to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, meant by Baggot, reduced the backing to five points.
There was a long refusal for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried down on a portable, and from the restart, Ayr enlarged the front with a Stafford McDowall-three, meant by Climo.
Ayr's observing captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an indefinite three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure game.
The home team made a return and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow map because he had killed for Climo without the ball, and from the prison line stand MacPherson killed the ball behind the coming Ayr-losmal.
Climo meant it, nest he also did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's goal head and sent away flank Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-star seems to be going to approach new career in restaurant business
It seems that Still Game-star will move to the hospitality industry after it has been discovered that he is designated as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedive Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last of the program, and it seems Kiernan is ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress didn't want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would be involved in Glasgow's "flouring restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': country-covered Bolivia hope court will open again to the Pacific.
Sheriffs patrol a maswork-covered fleet quarts in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are placed with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country - surrounded Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile is still fresh – nest the need to resume the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court on October 1, after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Den Haag will find in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of trackadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign pass to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who next year faces a controversial fight for reselection – has also many dependent on Monday’s judgment.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analytics believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia’s favor will decide — and that few will change if it does.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory, and pointed out that it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's judgment comes only six months after the final approach shows that the case "was not complex," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down over the last four years.
"The question of access to the sea has been caught by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales’ aggressive retoric cracked any remaining Chilean good - mindedness, she indicated.
Bolivia and Chile will continue conversations again at some point, but it will be enormously difficult to conduct unfair conversations.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in Den Haag, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will "have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "take an end to 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime question as a political crust.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless they can trust the U.S.A.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri was on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a consultation in Singapore between the competitive countries' leaders.
His comments follow to U.S. state secretary Mike Pompeo evidently are on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead point, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "droom image" that continued sanctions and US caption will bring to an explanation that ended the Korean war will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree with the statement without first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism over whether Pyongyang is serious about doing away from an arsenal that the country considers as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump Council.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large head covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you do not have to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have announced a series of overwhelming head covers at their SS19 collection on the running board that enthusiasted the style of Paris Modeweek.
Extremely unpractical hats passed through this summer Instagram, and these designers paraded their astonishing creatures on the walking board.
The excellent by Valentino was a overwhelming beige hat with a featherlike wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other overwhelming additions included water lemons decorated with jewels, a magic hat and even a pain apple – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had coated lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than skin coutures.
One creation looked like a sleeve, with a snorkel, and a dip brill, while another looked like a melted ice hockey.
And continuing the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers foretell that the huge hats may be on the way to the stores near you.
The overwhelming hats follow shortly on the hooks of 'La Bomba', the strawhead with a two-foot wide edge seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakakovski.
The cult label behind the extremely inpractical hat that was spread about socially, sent another great creation on the run-plank – a straw-strand bag that was almost as large as the swimming-breaked model that weared it.
The burned orange raffia bag, finished with raffinadery and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Mode Week.
Known stilist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in stores for the next summer – since the designer has made such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the request for overwhelming additional ones.'
John Edward: Language Skills Vital for World Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a ride performance of academic superiority, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exams, which were only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music, and other community companies.
With more than 30,000 schoolers throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schoolers and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schoolers for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school course, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the liga table with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolers who studied foreign languages had a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS 74 grade schools, showed that 72 percent of students had a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same view as the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school currikula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Vocational Training and Skills found in 2014 that some of the reasons for their difficulties in filling posts are 17 percent attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Thus, language skills become more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more likely job opportunities demanding languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to invest in today’s children’s language instruction.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered essential for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff specialists in this field.
Scotish independent schools have been dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equipped children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future will bring.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages must really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
I want the bees to be fair.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make a debut for San Diego Lakers.
The guard is almost over for attendants to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening game.
However, exactly how many minutes he is going to play still need to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell told me that James's probably going to play a limited amount of time.
After a exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six matches in the pre-season program.
"I don't need to get ready at this stage in my career for seasonal matches," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Convention Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a wave of election meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled collars in the next week, including stopping at friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice which is currently kept back for his choice to fill the vacation in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming selection because the Republicans are in danger of losing control over the Congress when voting in November.
How late is Trump's collaboration in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's accommodation in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look below through live streaming to Trump's accompanying in West Virginia.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearing for the named Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about accusations of sexual misbehavior with an expected confirmation voice that was held back for a week while the FBI investigated.
However, the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans standing before difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said that in the next week these five collisions were aimed at "to visit volunteers and supporters while Republicans try to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management of the Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, to Reuters.
This evening's collaboration, which was arranged for the Westbanco-arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virgin Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind the voting patterns.
"It's not for Morrisey a good sign that the president should come to give him a suppression at the voice bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three one - page sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this rider cup needed.
The vibrant swing of momentum is a totally distinct sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and definitely in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went for six points, and now it is four, so we wear it as a little momentum, I count," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and twelve more to be played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and signed each three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the hill to the shirt and guided by his example.
That screaming victory cranes became harder as she progressed and he sank a critical set to win four totally equal while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
His sethold who won the match on 15 for them was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that says to a man that he believes that the U.S. team has another chance.
"You really have to extract everything and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That is all that those players have left now.
18 wells to print their stamp.
The only players who have more scores over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the inevitable story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unmarried but charming couple found four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not sign one on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the number of jobs on Saturday morning as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That gap, and the way their energy seems to flow to and of this excessive crowd, confirms that they are the players to be knocked on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari that can sound a potential European victory when the sun is over Le Golf National sack.
Prefer both at the same time or at different sources.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short sets with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s fourball hero, when playing with Alex Noren.
One holds over the number of tracks and two doubles on the fore nine, the Spaniard and the Swedish had landed in a hole from which they couldn't even get nearly.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and four-game teams are so excited to watch from near because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change into an eyelight.
So far, Europe has always played better as a team and has taken significant priority on the last day, but this four-play session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the battle that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder cup, after they have come from Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches with a forehead of 10-6.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their count so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to preserve the trophy that had lost them two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that had done unequally in the morning's fourballs, so that they won the series 3-1.
The U.S.A. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not reduce the back.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single game games to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newman who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called after a sensational weekend "Moliwood", are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup that recorded four points after their first four matches.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they played excellently together to conquer a father of Woods and American newman Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed brilliant flashes but now he had lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's fourballs, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 downlay for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - which is the first and third on the world record.
However, on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris, Europe did not always find their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a great tournament and Justin Thomas put the mark for the Americans with two points.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four games after losing the first two springs.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder-cup has a team recovered from a backstand of four points when they enter the single game, even though Furike's team needs to play just equally to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After two days’ second, however, they do not seem to be able to make a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'definitely' universely without confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister said to the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions would increase their distrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Body's Annual General Assembly that in the last year, North Korea has taken "a significant well-will" measures, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promised not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We, however, see no corresponding response from the U.S.A.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S.A., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not unanimously disarmament ourselves first."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance against a "phased" approach to removing nuclear weapons that will be rewarded if it takes steps gradually, his words seemed meaningful because it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first top council between a president of the U.S.A. and a North Korean leader on June 12th in Singapore when Kim committed to work for "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised warrants for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Pjongjang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted requests to suspend strict international penalties against North Korea.
"The U.S.A. demands the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by strengthening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
"The phrase that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continued penalties worsen our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second top council between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader had pointed attention to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister pointed attention to three meetings in the past five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue was about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN's General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fires will be directed on the US country mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump for Kim called a "fire pileman" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "heletime," Kim gratified abundantly for his courage because he took steps to disarmament, but he said that much work should still be done and that sanctions must remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
But, U.S. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council that "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without stop until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to make funding for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes dry.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly, and later said that he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of putting "bandlike demands".
North Korea, in a meeting with Moon, promised to break down a missile site and also take a nuclear complex if the United States "conforms" measures.
He said that Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course about enough rest.
A new course at the Harvard university this year makes all its pre-graduate students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing macho culture of study by combating coffee-in-covered 'helicopter sessions'.
A academic found that students at the world’s top university are often ignorant when it concerns the basic principles of care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his species in the U.S.A.
He was inspired to start the course after he had spoken about the effect of sleep absorption on learning.
'At the end of it one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep was -- which surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered that year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help academic and athlete performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at the Harvard Medical Faculty and Executive Director of the University’s Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had been seriously taken sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students on coffee cups, gordins, exercise shoes and books need to click to be told about the effect of coffee and light and how athlete performance is influenced by sleep deficiency and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleeping risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routines.
'We know it will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know what the health impact of choosing to smoke cigarettes is," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to 'study healing' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep abuse is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 's secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid it to put on weight, because sleep absorption puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after last year, during his first year at Harvard, one of his classes.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to complete a similar study program before they join the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' that are radiated by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circuit rhythm and may cause you to have trouble touching the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga victories Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another arsenal of the day's heartache when Dolly Menga's target head, Steven Gerrard's uncommon team, brought a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win first as visitors since February's 4-1 seats at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had given Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 matches as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which had passed loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga swore seven minutes before rest, and it seemed not that a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there can be further difficulties for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was evidently thrown off the way.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed by Ayr to the final battle of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nupions with the way his well trained team had slaughtered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball beet, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, they must have recorded only two minutes’ points when Menga’s first deposit sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s purpose, but the middle field player opened his great chance.
A depth freescope by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only mistake at the backer end of the target.
Rangers took over control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to have a punishment goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless fought, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox targeter Liam Kelly was hardly plagued by Lassana Coulibaly's headhead and a low target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s openmaker at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of game, no one can deny that they have earned it, even though it is just for their hard work.
Rangers once again did not handle a deep piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolhead and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had a nearly immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett, who had invaded a long ball after a long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their advance in the last stages, but McGregor was well up to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come in widely from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a punishment head when he broke up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" almanak: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TAKE REQUIRE ... the day the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger.
Since then, the Geiger counter was a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geer counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these phones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms that are released by radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking about now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that is carrying his name continues.

Oxygen learns immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method includes withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A sample shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, learning the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, change in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "We results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and to "learn" them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat some kind of leukemia.
After his action on SNL, Kanye West started with a pro-Trump spot talk, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was issued during a Saturday night live in the studio after an outdated action in which he believed the U.S. president Donald Trump and said he would elect him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town and when he carried a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they're, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not sent out, the image of West’s scare was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to spot for West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that behind the stage it was difficult for him for what he was carrying on his head.
"They've curbed me behind the scene.
They said, "Let's go out with that hat."
They broke me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Will you see the low place?" and said that he would dress his "supermantle, because that means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment at least twice led out an audience at the audience and members of the SNL roll distribution seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication: "The entire studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the space chatter Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a execution of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who had whittled: "To one of the most courageous spirits: Thank you that you're standing at the scare."
But chat-punch-punch-punching woman Karen Hunter whizzed that West was just "who he was and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "kunst") who I believe accepts an ideology and proclaims that endangers my community.
He is free.
We also," she added.
Before the show, the space chatter on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now "the being that was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-room chatter, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion, and of course, widely musical legending Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

It is expected that the denominator will appear before the Belfast Landdrosshof.
The accusation will be reviewed by the public prosecution service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington criticizes toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his swordswing role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often mean that young boys feel that they should be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic maleness in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellowman from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, acknowledged that he felt "reasonally strong" about making work on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where we went wrong with maleness?' he said.
'What have our men learned as they grow up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television is likely responsible for the growth in toxic maleness due to its extreme male characters.
He continued, "What was inborn and what was taught?
What is taught on the TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they need to have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that is really one of the big questions in our time-- how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones persecutions and persecutions when the series next summer comes to an end, because he says he's ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actress revealed that he thinks that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-powered fantasy field.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family landings in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transferred by sex, which represents a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who gained HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officers said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transfer by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men having sex eventually will marry women.
Many of the transfers of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a personnel of GOP senators has been exposed to the data, condemns 'hazardous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters expired on Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawyers Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultrajust" experts and websites.
"Leuens, liars and still abomination lies," said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The selected information is said to include the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol hill during the Senate Panel's trial on the claims of sexual misbehavior against the appointed for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifys the source of the locations is linked to Waters' office and made known the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security were endangered due to this deceitful and false claim - was not at all responsible for the exclusion of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly provoked online criticism, including former Whitehouse Press Representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she has not the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics that he seemed to be too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light waters in the inter-election from the coasts, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he whittled.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the appropriate authorities and law application bodies of these deceitful claims.
"We will make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all that they do is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spy spot
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impression and it seems to apply to this resurrection of the Johnny English action comedie spotter franchise - which then began with Johnny English in 2003 and had further trouble with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will the tongue-in-the-the-choosing self-authors be the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
Anyway, the unhappy Johnny English with his peelories and rubber face had his license to have everything wasted up for the second time - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film hearers.
He is of course the ridiculous secret agent who despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance a little of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good screw of that old who had contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire theme song at the opening of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, who leaves chaos behind him, which Atkinson played at once in the narrow forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of JE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval pantser garment and cut the screw blades shortly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedie is shown but the humor feels fairly flawed and strangely overbound, especially when the "severe" film trade marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible now themselves comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels that it is intended for children rather than for adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silents in the persona of Bean.
The eternal themetic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cuber cracker infiltrate Britain's super secret network of spys and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the annoyment of the agent in service - a sad little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a Prime Minister who's a blowed and besieged character, who's already experienced a complete crash of political invilty: Emma Thomspson's doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each active spy is endangered, she should call on someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English itself, now in service as a teacher at some decent institution, but that from the record of teaching about how to be a secret agent, there are a few fun jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency mission and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a all-map-stick roll in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are from completely wasting up everything in Her Majesty’s secret service again, and they come to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is encountered by the dangerous enthusiasm of the charismatic technology billion that claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of ridiculous eskapades: assaulted as servants they burn a French restaurant, cause chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury hunting; and English let pure anarchy break when he trys to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene, nothing is saved, but as nice and exhausted as it may be, the whole offer is quite like child TV.
Reasonably mediumly.
And like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to his right?
Work denies that it's a plan for Britain to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week -- but for five days.
The party claims that corporate base savings caused by the artificial Intelligence (KI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will 'pass' at the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favour of the workers.
To change to a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Workers Party Source said to The Sunday Times: A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Worker Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not signed by the entire Worker Party.
A spokesman of the Worker Party said, 'A quarterly workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Worker Conference to weigh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from 'sightless directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back because a Worker Government can make 'deductions' on the basis of supposed wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on direct companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in businesses in the private sector to workers, which can receive annual dividends from up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least one week delaying and delaying the question whether the Office's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that was sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for republic sensation. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything they could change their opinions.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was determined, surely, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require a accusation of dynamit," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett denied it zealously," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all that she called couldn't confirm it.
It is 36 years old.
I see nothing new change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and did it anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the host of the World Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and has an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Civil Festival is now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will flow to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create consciousness for the real purpose of the opportunity to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen feast, which began in 2012, is an enlargement of the World Army Project, an international proclamation group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
To get a free card to the opportunity (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concert visitors had to execute a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a telephone call or any other meaningful way to create consciousness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivisime"- people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a whit?
Since 2011, Worldburger says that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that may affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a U.S.-based company of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential" and promised to give $35 million for Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after getting over 4.700 twitters from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and world citizens, just as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that ask "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
World Citizen answered: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-partity movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is among the artists who act in New York this year, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S.A. can use fleet for "blockads" to stop the export of Russian energy - minister of domestic affairs
"In case necessary," Washington can leave himself on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. Ministry of Inland Affairs, Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as makers of energy just as in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to a officer, there are ways and means to handle it.
"The United States have the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn't land on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendees of an event offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit, which viewed themselves as the "Voice of the Energy Consumer" in the U.S.A.
He went further to compare Washington’s approach to the management of Russia and Iran and noticed that it was practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, little or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "single-talent" with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come because Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a suppression to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including the American President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfair" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin's Moscow's "catched".
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin reasons that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is just driven for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their providers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, at a meeting with America's Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. opinion provoked against reaction from Germany, which confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's prominent organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) appealed to the U.S.A. to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" standing as president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she'd "thoroughly consider" standing as president to the middle-term selections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman at the highest sport," she said, "The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll seriously consider standing for president."
Warren aired her opinion about President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said, "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried in my heart about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twitter Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI investigation before our voice."
A Thursday survey showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight and fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts-choosers said the senator didn't stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Twenty-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent who had the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday evening and accused of an incident of household violence.
"What my own son goes through, which he goes through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury with which our soldiers return," she said to a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forces and any other member of the army have given for the country."
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while he was under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims flying from gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-judiciary order on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimer in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Libertic Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She tells her mate, "and his violent gang sons," mistreated her, but U.S. officials refused her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for U.S.A., as nations who face deep problems with gangs and household violence.
The new US asylum policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (Council of Immigration Appeals) allowing immigrants to apply asylum without the necessary documents that have escaped household violence.
District Columbia's lawyer General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores decades' state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will be decisive on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-judicial order.
Advocates further argued in the legal order that the policy that immigrants refused access damages the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "necessary work will provide."
Advocate General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to allow asylum to victims fleeing because of domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in its announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems — even not all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Hopeless rescue efforts in Palu, while death count doubled in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly narrow.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her fevery baby son at a evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Each minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants were seen where they returned to their devastated homes, searching for permeated possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 scope of shaking, were overwhelmed.
Of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who gained a broken back and shoulder, rests outside Palu’s army hospital where patients are treated outside because of constantly strong nails.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells about the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was impressed into the walls' ruin, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of 'fucking' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that commends the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. Ambassador for China Beijing accused that the American press was used to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid entry in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa's newspaper with most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the US Congress elections of 6 November, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US selections, marked what US officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that led to their customs rounds of customs on each other’s imports.
China’s remuneration rates early in the trade war aimed to beat exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and US scholars.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "it's now worse the mob by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"With the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government grew America's coveted tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast with that, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited abnormal voices and not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have about China's alarming economic activity, giving that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China’s most prominent newspapers was scared away from the offer of publishing his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republicans alienate female choosers from inter-elections with Kavanaugh-debakel, warn analyzers
While many top-republics stand at High Court-generated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analyticals warned that they would see counteraction during the coming interferences, especially of women.
The emotions about this are extremely high, and most Republicans are recorded that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor in political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s urge for an FBI investigation on the narrow will be enough to piss heavy choosers.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.-courant.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is on the way!" drowned as they argued in the senate's portal, while the Republicans who chose the Judge Committee to continue Kavanaugh's appointment despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"The people say it was already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger votes, 18- to 29-year-olds, who do not often vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness which sets out the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-generated, analyzers said that if the Republicans continue with the confirmation, they could follow a reaction.
"It became a junk for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities of the United States, pointed out a group that helps choose democracies, to the news channel.
But Americans seem a little divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s witnesses, with a little more choosing the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s witness, while 35 say they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was likely or definitively shocked during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s urge, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed last week under oath before the Senate's Judgment Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her at 17 years of age while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-genominated his sexual parts had revealed to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the battle
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, starts a start job trying to deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the idea with Inrupt is "World Rule".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is completely based on the user who can gain access to that type of information.
The company calls it "Personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralised applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about the release of a total change if not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a place on Media that was published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.

Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross spiritual celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honoured in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Prime Minister Bernard Vann acquired the assignment in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But four days later he was killed by a shooter and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brillant symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, lt.kol. Vann on September 29, 1918 led his batalion over the Channel de Saint-Quentin "through a lot of dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
Later he hurried to the fireline and led the line forward with the "largest braveness" before he stormed a man-only a field gun and knocked out three of the section.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German shooter – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never do, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a cliff to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orkes.
Michael Vann said he "feeling honored to play a role in the parades" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to look at the follow - up Bellator 206, just to not be able to see the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be sent directly through the night to the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on the way to tell each other the battle, viewers in the United Kingdom were stumbled when the covering changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unexpressed after staying awake to the battle until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the conversion to the child's drawing as "one or another sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice-president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Pepper the pig," yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they'll work on their schedule to include UK watchers in the future.
"I think when I think of the re-emission, I think we can probably work out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there, and we will not be able to send it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many texts that were sent back and back, and it wasn't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally make — and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just went through our time.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minderworthy' about sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a minority feeling about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not all are like me."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he had his feelings about gay-rights to give others "hope".
He also said that becoming a parent was less concerned about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, had taken a few months because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of less than, and otherwise, are the real things that gave me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he disappointed no one when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance in this year's state alliance games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He says he has emptied his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three - time world champion said that to get in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “had taken him away. ”
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but says the age difference has never been a question.
"When you experienced so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and low points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she's changed "hele perspective".
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a golden medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are more things than Olympic golden medals.
My olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had all tickets for London 2012 — because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him," you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he had stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not inconquered," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I dreamed about for my life -- to dive before my homes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small – who also resonated with him in building up to the Olympics and still giving him chicken flesh.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and retired from Saturday's riding cup.
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup Match, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-- the 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furike for Saturday's four-ball games and four-folds.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold Major winner will divide his day in the meantime to be ration leader and on the exercise bow work on his game in the hope of fixing what is wrong.
Even at the peak of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old wasn't the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National Railway where the long rural is always punishing the misleading holds.
And as if the job on its own was not challenging enough, Mickelson came on Sunday in his ninth match against the exact British Ope Champion Francesco Molinari, who had collaborated with newman Tommy Fleetwood to win all their four matches this week.
If the Americans, four points behind, start the 12 single game games well, Mickelson’s race can be absolutely essential.
Furich expressed his trust in his husband, not that he could say much different.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a knock on the back and sat his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furik.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hero Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably did not imagine that he would play two games.
I put more in the prospect, but this is how things worked out and what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most of the Ryder Beker competitions.
It can mark the end of a rider cupway that has never really matched the peaks of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 settlements, and seven halfs, although Furich said that his presence had contributed inadmissible aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, captured, like shirting the crazy, and he's a wonderful old to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shirting crazy with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows great front can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows out of experience that a considerable advance before the last day's single game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Deen made its debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point front, but only nail crawl won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"One continues to remind yourself that we had a great advance at Valderrama; we had a great advance at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail crawl," said Bjorn, on the photo, after watching how the class of 2018 had won 5-3 Friday and yesterday was 10-6 before at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it is not over.
You're going full-speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I'm still saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Enjoy how his players went on the difficult golf course, adds Bjorn: "I will never go ahead with it.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes to the turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you need to transmit to players, making the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also find the best out of himself."
In contrast with Bjorn, his companion Jim Furyk will want his players to go better individually than they did as gamesmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three points from four.
Furyk himself had been surrounded on both sides of that big last-day, where he was part of the wishpan at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every diluted word of it," he said in answer when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke his players courage on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as it was seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts much stress on those middle matches.
We set up our team accordingly, and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us something magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counter attack and faced the main match against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I have chosen this group of boys in this order, because I think it covers it until the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Deferred Again
The German army's latest fregat would have been put in service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War-era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to defective systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The acquisition of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splinternnew Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to The Time newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
This ship must have joined the fleet in 2014, but the distressing post-leaving issues have devastated this ambitious project’s fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class of vessels ordering the Navy in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class fregates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a stroke of air defence and anti-ship missiles as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to develop the latest fregates for up to two years away from homes.
However, continuous delays mean that the advanced warships — which will evidently enable Germany to project power overseas — will already become obsolete at the time they enter into service, call the Time.
The disastrous F125 feast made records last year when the German fleet officially refused to operate the ship and sent it back to Blohm & Voss' shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet sent a ship back to delivery to a shipbuilder.
Few are known for the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew on older Bremen class fregates.
It also revealed that the ship is drasticly overweight, which reduces work performance and reduces the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Pfalz" are presumed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price label for the entire project — including training of the crew — also became a question.
It evidently reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that have beaten the new fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the fleet's "ships that can be deployed are on the move."
The official said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Fleermouse’s Secret Life
New research is carried out on a landscape in the Scotland Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow both the ordinary and sopranal wing Mouse as well as the brown long-ear and Daubenton wingmouses at Invereve gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to track flare mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings by using hand indicators.
Expert-clan channels of all surveys will check the regularity of the fladdermouse calls and determine which species to do.
A habitat card and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation advisor for NTS hopes the results will reveal what areas of the habitat is most important for the bats and how it is used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and the best way to manage forests for baths and other associated species.
Fleermouse populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have decreased considerably during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by home cats.
Flag mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-orientation technique to show goggas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings and bedroom inspections and sometimes carry out salvation.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bath reserve at Threave-landgoed in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland’s ten flavour species.
Agriculture manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very veterinary trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the need to search for bats before maintenance in property is done because it is possible that unaware destruction of a single breeding place can mean 400 females and young ones' death and can eradicate a whole local population.
Flag mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them, or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their population is going."
Ronaldo declines rape precautions while lawyers are preparing for German journal.
Cristiano Ronaldo has destroyed rape-proof against him as "false news" and said that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to apologize for German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, published by the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus precursor was accused of raped a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He claimed to pay her $375,000 to stay silent over the intent, reports Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he speaks to his 142 million followers, hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, declared the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or-winning to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyer's ready to take up Der Spiegel on the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called "inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for "moral damage compensation for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed intent was supposed to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to go to the player’s room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the claimed intact and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" that was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consistent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a statement outside the court because she was "bang for revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to turn the arrangement back now because she was still traumatized by the claimed inside.
Ronaldo was at the time of the claimed assault to join from Manchester United to Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a $100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: United Kingdom will lose it 'forever repentance' as their car manufacturers.
The UK 'will repent forever' if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it would have to stop temporary production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-conformity-brexit, could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which produced Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union last year.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's director at Burnaston.
Other UK automobile manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
For example, BMW said they'd close their Mini-Agent in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what motor manufacturers say is transport chain risks in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "net-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbance at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success but to us to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue what was an extremely successful set of transport chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be stopped, but warned that additional costs at the long term could reduce the company’s competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for 24 years at Burnaston and is the Unite Union's collaborator on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Whitehuis.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Advocate General Rod Rosenstein can "be postponed with another week" while the fighting on nominated for the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh continued, the Whitehouse said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special judicial advisor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible cross-bombing of the right by the president.
Whether the Advocate General Trump is going to resign or not, and thereby threatening Mueller's independence, for months Washington's gossip has been driving up for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to take up conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied that report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, in the middle of reports that he was on his way to give up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choos not to thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was deferred to avoid a conflict with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misbehavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump charged a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed by another week with all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ from that statement: Sanders have not yet held a Whitehouse press information session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarceness of information sessions is not due to a contradiction for TV journalists who are "efficiency hunting," although she said, "I won't fight with the fact that they are effectively hunted."
She then indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would grow.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence, "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this very much and you've seen us do it very much in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignity clerks.
Solo Pressure Declarations are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and sometimes bizarre appearance before journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff who worked in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the desire to stay in Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also reinforced their preparations for a possible non-contract scenario.
I know it is for all of you a very disturbing time.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value each member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and further, offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he had a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee team's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and kind of just collapseed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the margin before he was placed on a portable and was taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee states said to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theatre at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there's "no details about the type/range of the injury" and Tennessee's still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved away from Illinois.
He died five times on Saturday before leaving the game, which brings his total for the season on 18 death barrels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to move young choosers.
The seal tax will be charged on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Thesoury expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal taxes when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless ones, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to move young choosers with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be lifted on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The by - tax — which is outside the current sailing tax, including the higher levels established two years ago on second houses and houses purchased to rent — can be up to as much as three percent.
The Thesourie expects that this move can bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's newly built property is bought by non-UK citizens who succumb the prices and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the house door.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “spook villages ” because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping their property prices high by raising land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to take off quotas on affordable houses to restore Britain’s "residency disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of suggested housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no-fault exclusions".
He also wants to give advice to greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "I said last year I would devote my preliminary office to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British inhabitants.
For too many people the dream of house ownership has become a despised dream and the humiliation of homelessness a too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to govern Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North-East team, which is currently third in Liga One, three points below the upper.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after leading back to the Scottish Prime Ministership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but that was all," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child, I often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that draws me back.
The event, however, can only come if I'm successful with club transmission."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa athletic-master said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a great club, after he had previously rejected presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now, success will be measured for me by ''can I let this club return to the Premier-liga?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it must be in the Premier-liga," he said.
"It's not a easy task to get it there, but I'll probably view myself as successful only if I can get the club out again."
Ross' career in the management is only three years, after a period as assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' trainee staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and transformed St. Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his play course at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroad," he said when he thought back about how he took over Alloa's leads.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence of it and experienced reasonable peaks.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that one must come through weekly.
I still go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I've been in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The summer heating wave improved Britain’s struggling crown’s income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bars saw sales rise by 2.7% in July — but receptions in restaurants were decreased by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting company CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as last month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even more severely hit.
The decrease of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Drankie-led drinking places and bars have done far better and increased more than restaurants have dropped.
Food-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over all driven bars and drinking places, sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food was disappeared by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the tendency that we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of large social or sport events remain the biggest factors in sales in the out-the-home-out market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 percent years per year would be particularly difficult above and other than continuous expenses.
The long warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking places and restaurants, including new places opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the desire for trademark admissions.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the United Kingdom's drinking site, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 business groups, with a collective conversion of more than £9 billion and is the established measurement in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta-pages"
The news has increased fear that sexual content is placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years – creates social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school teachers revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the photo subsite Instagram.
The news has increased fear that sexual content is placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show to parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them acknowledging that they have private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are in the temptation to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "stimme for athletes" on Scottish athletes' council.
Eilidh Doyle was preferred to the Board of Scotian Athlete as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the management body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scotian, United Kingdom and world athlete community and we are sure sports in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the advice," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes, and hope I can really contribute and help lead the sports in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympics, is now a regular BBC technician, could not walk after he had a short-term ischemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only the time would learn whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhaustive work, but fully recovered, learned again how to walk, and doing practice exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouraging!"
Breastspam paths that compare mothers to cows divided opinions online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To celebrate the leads of what is called the "world's first silently portable breast pump," the consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue in-the-choosing music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers that milk.
Four right mother's dance in a sleeve full of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't seen, it's not onions, it's my breasts."
The core part says, "Push it out, pump it out, I carry out the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the ad on the company's Facebook page has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed response from viewers, with many who say it undermines the "gruves" of the milk industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
We must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen of them within days of their birth," wrote one.
The Elvie breast pump passes discreet in a nutrition bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another remarked: "It is understandable that it is traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump to mothers that can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertising is so out of feeling."
Others defended the advertising, with one woman acknowledging that the song for her was screaming funny.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I had still breastfeeded.
To milk out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another remarked: "It's a nice advertising aimed at mothers who feel milking (often in their workplaces or toilets) and like "cows".
It is not a advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bra's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or pipes, and is just discreet in a nutrition brass that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD of Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a great and exciting advertising.
By dragging a parallel between women who milk and milk cows, we wanted to put the milk process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while in a entertaining way people can find joining the wonderful feeling of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the runboard for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persistent migrant children has increased sharply, although monthly border transitions have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to bad retorics and policies established by the Trump administration which make it more difficult to place children at cash.
Traditionally, most cash were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was put in danger by stepping forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that possible cash and other mature members of their households should take their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official at immigration and customs enforcement before the Congress, witnessed that the agency had arrested thousands of people who applied to pay unmarried minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Most 80 percent of the individuals who are either cash or household members of cash, are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which were the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear through a video conference call, rather than personally, to appeal to their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unqualified for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in arrest, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape efforts, according to refugee workers and reports that have come out of the system in the past months.
Advocates say that these concerns are increased at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child’s problems are more easily missed because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends, can worsen the trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupied forces’ to withdraw immediately.
When he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as minister of adjunction, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian ground, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "conformly handled".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions who have been displaced, is "atmost over".
He said that Damascus will continue "to carry out this sacred battle until we have cleaned all Syrian areas" of both terror groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mostly opposed Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs to President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - violated country.
Regarding the question of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were okay for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irracial fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have made an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organizations to fasilize these returns," he said.
"They politics something that should just be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomas have said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last large rebel vesting of Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement defended a huge attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "definite seeds" and expressed the hope that military action will target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front that will be "extinct".
UN Sent, Staffan de Mistura hopes to bring together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to set up a post-war constitution for Syria and to ban the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "navigating the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-selection in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals will end his presidentship early.
In what undoubtedly "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now there are no signs of sighting tiredness.
Since 2014, CCN has doubled more than 1.05 million to CCN and almost tridubble to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million top-time watchers, up to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" are top cable views with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people were drawn, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a few hard truths about snoaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxirite in Boston before the 2016 selection.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, she asked.
"He said, "For he let me laugh," said me. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, different from anything else on the TV, the story lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
To disable is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 Structure Leather Airbag ("a cloth of the hybris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Parts of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program, is that he feeds you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, business head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump program's changing role sharing and daily cracks in the plot (such as seeking dispute with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un to commend).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was looking at MSNBC inside while he took CNN.
He could not scrap him, not with Brett Kavanaugh on the way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outdoor money flows to the most exciting medium-term selection races in House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees a flow of money, thanks to a shift of conventional districts that have now brought two officials into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban district of Pittsburg let Democracy Rep. Conor Lamb – who won its seat in another district in a special election last spring – measure powers.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavy overflowing with the new 17th.
The cards were repaired after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally dependent in the Republicans’ favor.
The race in the new 17th was launched with a campaign funding competition between the large parties’ financial legs, the Democratic campaign’s Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Fields Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania to win a nail scrap in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the democracies a little advantage.
U.S. thought of penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China but then turned back
Diplomas noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to call back the American heads from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "long decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in an explanation.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reductions in financial assistance and enforced visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up at a similar convention last year which was considered a step forward in a attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top-administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue effectively to end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Advocate President Mike Pence is now determined to speak to the convention, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomates said.
And the three U.S. Messengers returned silently to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or straves from Washington.
A Whitehouse spokesman for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analytical who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen may be the special discussion about Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - infringement of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller suspectedly also focuses his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
Would the Congress go over in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to stare in the face of responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to go before the choosers again, and perhaps eventually before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of asses, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his correspondents in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to execute a state arrest against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakes at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the burial of the years that followed.
The course of history turns around such turnpoints and democracy’s covetous course is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump, Advocate General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to take the president secretly and speculate whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times ’ report is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest witness?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a conference that will hold responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we watch those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government that lived at a time in my ambassadors' house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to put on Sabbath-chers on that table wearing the swastic.
With this when I come back, how can't I be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe Liga.
A knee injury prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2-equipment equation against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use this outcome as a escape place for larger things.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the competition with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but an equation is probably a righteous result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it'll be a difficult match, because they've had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feeling factor in the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now press, last season behind us, and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement money fear
Despite the fact that recorders have a clear idea of how they want to be cared, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they talk to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
Here is true to start.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your advisor and your family to declare where and how to receive care, as those choices may be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Invite your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-security with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Compare your legal documents: Cut off judicial contests at the pace.
Get a healthcare staff instead, so you will instruct a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, authority for you financially.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are inappropriate.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not only the financial issues that are in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medicine?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is placed."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a windbuck when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the breast, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "probable act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death count is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from the Donggala government, a area north of Palu close to the center of the 7.5 scope of shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to security after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central-Sulawesi province, located at the end of a smal bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a rainy that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwestern Sulawesi island.
The government, a administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is usually concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia is sitting on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here's some of the big earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A large shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakings hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, which led to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 scope of shaking hit near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 scope of shaking hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking hit the Pidie Jaya rain in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It did not this time lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that fell down,
2018: Large shootings hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shaking destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily struck.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested on charges of household violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of household violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of household violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female knowledge phone with her when she called the police to register the claimed crimes.
Palin is arrested at Mat-Su Prosecution Facility and is held on a $500 unsecurified cash, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, surely" when asked what he pleaded, the network reported.
Palin stares three class A infringements in the face, which means he can be locked up for a year and paid $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B infringement, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints were made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the claimed attack.
The case is currently serving before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of household violence, interference with the report of a crime of household violence, and possession of a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed to have boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military duty in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake TSUNami: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 scope of earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been excluded with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that point the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach feast in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking rare death sentences for suspects in NYC terreur attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspicion in the New York City Terreur Attack that caused eight people's death – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, said to have used a Home Depot truck to harvest a attack on a bike road along the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan to pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" given serious physical injuries, according to the notification of the intention of asking for the death penalty, submitted to the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, both of those accusations are carrying possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal major jury Saipov struck 22 accusations, including eight accusations of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "definite planning and preconsistency", said the prosecutors, and described the way Saipov carried it out as "absurd, cruel and pervers."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, injury and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since then, the Southern District of New York has legally persecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life - long prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been killed after they were sentenced for a complot to perform spies for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were teared with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an inhabitant of Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to detectives that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after he had watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He appealed innocently to the 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty instead of accepting a debt recognition to life prison penalty with no possible release will only extend the trauma of these events to all the stakeholders." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had earlier asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL ARAGE should be placed in the management of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "heat" of Euroshippers – as one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in the management of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone said to the March in Birmingham that at the time the United Kingdom would "be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces is to unite her deeply divided officers by pro-Romein Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of the attacks of Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Alliances insisted that she would press through in her attempt to make an agreement with Brussels despite the death process – and force Euroshipers and Work to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Run Significant Run-Congress in Solihull that he wanted to kick out Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a noble man and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in control, we would have been out by time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to kick Chequers out.'
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to rejoice is completely false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at March and said to reporters: ‘I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are unwelcome with the general public, the opposition is not voting for it, it is unwelcome with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are first chosen.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Color told us that the convention politicians had to feel the "hitte" if they were on the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 reference.
'It is now about a case of confidence between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'we won't let you get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
'We mobilize the people's army of this country that gave our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regarding, proud United Kingdom.'
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they held a convention for two hours in the city center.
Some activists winked towers against Brexit bananas by the proclamation of the group this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
‘It is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus place, for the wrestless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ he added.
'That's a total smart.
There's not something like a good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard on' to stand for president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren she says she'll look "hardly to stand for the president" by the November selections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, stands for re-selection in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of reflection that his Trump may challenge in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with artists with the use of the city hall format since Trump was ruled.
A attendee asked her if she was planning to stand before the president.
Warren answered that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman all up."
Arrest in Shoot Death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, L.A., announced Saturday that a suspect in the death of LSU basket player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University’s campus.
"Wayde Sims got a fire in the head and finally died as a result," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated, and acknowledged that he was in possession of a weapon, and acknowledged that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without an incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-six-year-old who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 matches with 10 advanced seasons last year, and he maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 return balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sounds world title after team commands gave him his win over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the resorts.
From stake, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Bolt to attack his teammate.
Bold first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive in the whole back of the bond of traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes took a round later and came out behind Bolt, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action that the Ferrari driver seen againstsight-free risk-free the inside had left at risk of endurance after a double movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstaping started from the back row from the outspring routine and was seventh at the end of the first round on its 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the trips as he held on his bands to quickly finish and cross Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
At the 44th round, he may have come into the wells, but could not accelerate his pass in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkon took the fourth place.
It was said that this was a difficult day, because Valtteri did greatly all weekend and was ‘a true master.
The team did outstanding work to have a one-two," said Hamilton.
It had been fairly bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed at a convention on Saturday Senator Dianne Feinstein about her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court-generated Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Court Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "commune and foolish and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that has taken place in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil and common and liars," he said.
"When you look at explanations and lectures and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it... no, we didn't leak it," he added, in an event of the senator.
Feinstein was sent to the letter that explained the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the lecture had come from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidently as she had asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday evening, "I tell you what. It was fairly bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-genominated charged by three women of sexual misbehavior and suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means of power.
You see the commonness, the unrighteousness, they don't care about who they hurt, who they should drive around to get power and control," reported Mediaite the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday's Elite League's loss against Belfast Giants by winning the counterfeit 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-purpose guidance by rolls from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team equally before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee equal before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen goals fixed their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had first lost competition and then won Friday evening Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
In the fourth minute, Dwyer’s openball came at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull help, with David Rutherford, who offered the help when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought back the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took lead to the first break in when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again got them equal with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match Friday.
Air traffic manager dies to make sure hundreds of flying can escape earthquakes
A air traffic manager in Indonesia is regarded as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had lifted safely.
More than 800 people died and more are missing after a large earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong post - shocks in the area, and many are trapped in breakdowns in the city of Palu.
Yet, despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower who had swung severely on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained inevitable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thrived together on the day.
Later he died in the hospital.
Speechman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart broke to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death count can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster shining agency, which says that access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"There is believed that the death count continues to increase because many bodies are still under the building cases while many cannot yet be achieved," said agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached up to six meters rubbed Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supply.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Each minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minor markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross chases to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military service: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people died.
Micronesian aircraft accident: Air Niugini says when one man is missing after the beach sea plane accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evakuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in an explanation that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable state.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium - depth water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air creatures had paniced and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures working close to improving a key also helped with a blow-up boat with salvation to get people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet)’s water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in collapse of PNG registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analists set timeline from the evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the hearing of a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intellectual analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile records to gather the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the evening that was his death.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's draw that night, Sanford said, "jok, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were deleted from his phone.
"He surely made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was planned to begin his final plea on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative look of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the packaging of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent repair in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
No more black person?!
NY-children's wife marrys a couple because she's divorced for "racist" text.
A New York children's girlfriend succumbs a couple for discrimination after she received a wrongly addressed message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the contested with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was excited when she found out that Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEWEEEEEE NOW A SWART PERSOON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it twice to me Maurice.
After she discovered her mistake, a "awful" Plasco-Flaxman me Maurice dismissed and said that their outgoing child girlfriend who was African-American did bad work and that she rather expected a Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice succumbs to the couple for damage compensation for the discount and seeks his damage compensation for the amount of $350 a day for the six months, inhabitant work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post on Friday and added, "I know it is discrimination."
The couple returned to the claims that they were racist, saying that it was reasonable to end Maurice’s inclusion and feared that they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said man Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But would you sit your children in the hands of someone who you were unclean with, even if it had been absurd?
Your newborn baby?
Now."
Plasco compared the case with "expression" and said that his wife would have had a baby over two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the trial continued, the court of public opinion had been quick to put the couple on social media and to chopp them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a speaking bear would not bring readers into connection.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been intense if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the child book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bitter sweet" last year.
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was silently proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't an appellant man," she said.
"But because Paddington was real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was fairly bad, that they hadn't expected that she would make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heartbeat.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart on the knock were slowly touching up and leaving her system.
She's a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit down there waiting, knowing that it appears to be unfolding.
I could not cry or cry or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who at that time was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers - unaware of the trial she had gone.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had fallen my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got a overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women post cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones for suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards for a while on a Walish bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
My Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18 years of age.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had cleared any room."
But he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out to whom you can go and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or anything with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It breaks a hole through the family.
It distinguishes us.
But we all must go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still undecisive as the FBI starts to investigate
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless inquiry that had no entrance - could we perhaps bring a little unit," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling apart" under entranced partisane hopping.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his republikan supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition is all because of time calculation.
The interferences are only gone weeks, on November 6, - if, as expected, the Republicans are badly disappeared, then they will become severely weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have to go to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who had met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivered his report?
There will be a voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democracies are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that Mike Pence, the Vice-President, will allow to break an equality and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean overflower numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean surrors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, said a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-sugh quoted data from the South Unification Cabinet and said that there were 1,127 overflows last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher tariffs asked by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The large majority of survivors from the North are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the high-protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreans.
China considers the transitors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, who are still technically speaking in war with one another, have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations that focused around the strange negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed on Saturday US penalties for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarmament ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries," he says he is inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called High Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said he was temperately unqualified to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would say 'histeries'," Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's witness before the Senate's legal committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times he screamed and shouted as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also expressly disapproved democratics on the committee and called the claims against him a "shameful and coordinated character luck murder" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s evidence proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he had been condemned against democracies.
"I think he makes himself inappropriate with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was tricked when she was asked whether she would try to complain Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as democratics the majority won in the Lower House.
"I'll say it -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified to be at the Supreme Court, but to be in the court where he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that she was as a democrat concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on affordable care or Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would reverse certain High Court decisions.
"It's not time for a histerical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'is not wonderful,' Pelosi said.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger that cooks over, and she cannot find it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," I told Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said she was crying when she became angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she would have said to the person with whom she spoke, "you might think that I was sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for magic because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found that I cry with nameless anger and was grabbed at my necklace by an older woman--a cold manager for whom I was a little scared--who dragged me into a reportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know that you are angry.
They think that you are sad and will rejoice, because they have affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congress woman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was captured in an outmarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snowy and the Seven Dwergy."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fun collections, so she made a vow that she would not enter the trips unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men would give her only $250.
"Think they get me off?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target electors rather than delegates, and evil for the sexism - that she had stuck.
You would have thought I had a nervous crash," recalled Schroeder about how the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporative cash.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my grave stone?
"She cryed?"
How the US Shina trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the United States and China had been overdoubing and while the battle was over, a dispute between the countries may be in the long term beneficial to Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, had fired the first warning earlier this year by loading important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, the most interesting escalation rolled in with new rates that affect $200 billion ($150 billion) items and effectively load half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing took revenge every time and recently knocked rates from five to ten percent on $60 billion American goods.
China promised to equate the US shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to pass on requests, but publicly complying with the US's requests would be too much of a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure on US trade war on the long term China can be positively supported by reducing the mutual dependency of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could start an economic twelve air in any of the countries, is actually far more dangerous than the audiences had already confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the centre of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'to return' for refugees, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the land destroyed by a war for more than seven years.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions improve in the country.
"Today the situation at the ground level is more stable and safe due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fleeed the country since that time the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need philantropical assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the land.
But he emphasised that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that guaranteed the invasion.
Europe seal rider-cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the rider cup of 2018 and overcome the United States with a final point of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US have now lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a rider cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, made his T-hou in the water at the pair-3 16th hole and admitted his competition to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari has blinked in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since then started the tournament's current format in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blowed out by the lowest player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest grade, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who might have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight riders, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He uses the fakle over to his fellow John Ram who won the Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 run-out Ryder record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all times and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. struggled to find the cleanfield with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team, "I am proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a little heat on Europe this morning.
We deleted.
Hut down for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You must keep your hat shiny.
We are superior."
