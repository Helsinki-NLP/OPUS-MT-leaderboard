How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It's just not worth the effort.
We arrived a little late.

Hello!
Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?

When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I have forgotten him clean.
The horse is in the forest.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
Okay, I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where's Tom eating breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You must have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the errors, if there are.
My conscience bothers me.
Several houses were washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend like tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick one folds a thousand cranes of paper, her desire will be true.
Tom had forgotten them clean.
Don’t be late for the train.
If you find something that you are good with and what you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.

If the idiots were to compete, you would come second, because you're too silly to come first.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom hadn't come.
I don’t want to remember.
Hurry up!
They are in the library.
It was better that Tom did not.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we will end.
Tom stood up early.
That's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sport?
The girl in the blue jacket is my daughter.
Our teacher began to sing a song well.
We are not going to eat everything.
But you know well that these negative consequences would have.

Do you know anything about them?
Where's the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I drink tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I am not going to be bouled in doing so.
All we can imagine is real, but what really is is the real question.

There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from a person I have never met.

I'm in a play.
Do not believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak good enough French!
I'm not going to be able to come visit for a while.

There was a cat on the table.
It was a moist, grey summer day at the end of June.
Why would I lie?
Go inside.
I'm going back to my office.
I don't speak Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I overcome later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom won't care.
Sami made it up last week.
What should we do about him?
The food is right.
I'm dressing my socks in a japtrap.
Tom continued to try.
Tom wouldn't risk it.
My horse is black.
If it is false, she is a liar.

Why should Tom do this?
Do you not add sugar?
I’m not easy to scare.
She is now doing her homework.
What shirt will you carry to school today?

She can answer your question.
Can I look at your ticket?

I can't see anything.
Tom committed suicide by jumping from a bridge.
Dreams always come out differently.

Don’t waste your money by buying things you don’t need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do that.
She had a house at the sea.
Have you ever been in Paris?
That's the last straw.
We know each other quite well.
Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
We all go.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He speaks more than French, he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.

Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your name is the first one on the list.
Is that necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Was you busy yesterday?

My sister is beautiful.
With the sun, they left their work.

I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I would not be surprised.
It's rain.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were very young.
Tom would never have done so.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I didn’t really want to win.
I am no longer scared.
I hoped we could become friends.
Tom screams.
My grandfather made his own furniture.
He does not like to travel by plane.

His music is known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice, no matter what you say.
Dawn is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom will not appear at all.
I must have imagined myself.
Let's practice.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success.
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said he had not kissed Mary.
The clock is sounding.
I'm not going to get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I did.
I'm a friend of Robert.
I want to be her friend.
Do not move.

That's what you get!
Will Tom die?
A dog ran after the cat.
I also kissed for Tom.
Why don't you join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.
Tom was imprisoned.
It's not a joke.
You have promised you will come.
I would be crazy to expect such a thing.
Christmas father stays in the North Pole.
I was born in Tokyo and pooped.
I got cold.
Let's put the television off.
Unfortunately, I would not be very good company.

But I would get you out.
Tom drinks more than anyone I know.
I like prey.
He's not always home on Sundays.
My sons are soldiers.
I don't want to hurt you.
Tom is looking for a easy way to lose weight.
Tom had to go.

You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.

I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'll be now.
My son still believes in Christmas Father.
I hate driving.
Sami's got to wait a little.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice it.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my dad, do you?
I'm now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks forward to the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is able to read.
It seems that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel gave me the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he.
I put it back where it belonged.
I'll take a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I constantly dream about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not very hungry yet.
There is probably a easy solution for dir problem.
I totally forgot about her.
We must start doing so.
Living in Japan is expensive.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot to clean her.
Tom said that it was unfair.
I don't want to marry.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you rise, he will be studying.
I have a dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fighting lasted for a week.
When did you last laugh?
Tom's not going to give a talk today.
Why have you joined the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us through the study of diseases.
Tom's sitting at the window reading a book.
We will not be here after 2:30.
I like eating meat.
But I could make it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He's kicking me!
She reads the newspaper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please, forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so badly.
I eat rice.
Can I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
It's rain.
Tom will be late.
I risk you to bridge the bridge.
I only bought a few new shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can overcome their fear.
This cannot be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my paraphrase.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings memories from my parents back.
Tom will no longer get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, it should not trust him.
You must have visited Kyoto.
I rose up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God had not existed, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we married.
She is not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in the autumn, when the weather was rainy, windy and wet, and the cold could intrude the thickest garment, especially on the sea, a poor boat with only two men went into the sea.
On night, all cats are gross.
Silence!
This is my home now.
A bird flying.
He came up for 30 minutes.
He reaches out to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
What a man sows, that he also will reap.
I wish you had said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I have a place to keep searching.
Tom has a lot on his board.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the following!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We have forgotten her.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example, Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
It's really nice!
The river flowing through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
