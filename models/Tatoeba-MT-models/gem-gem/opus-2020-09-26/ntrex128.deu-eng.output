Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusions with the Muppets
The proposal to amend its title in the 'MWP' (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) gives rise to disturbance in some national parliamentary members.
This is why plans are to change the name of the National Assembly in 'Welsh Parliament' (Walish Parliament).
Members of the National Assembly fear all political directions to become the target of spot.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was worried because the name “Twp” and “Pwp” were “awned”.
For non-Walise readers: In the Wales, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the whole group was "not happy" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Walish letter w is spoken similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Board), which is currently drafting a law for name amendments, said: "The final decision on the names of the national members of the Assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the body published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of the National Assembly Members, the 'Welsh Parliament Members' (Walish Parliament Members) or 'WMPs' was preferred, while in a public hearing the 'MWP' option was the most supported.
The National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but calling for a consensus for the chairman Elin Jones, who is supposed to present a draft law within weeks, could be a problem.
The reform law will contain further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of national members of the Assembly and the design of the Committee system.
Members of the National Assembly can finally vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonian votes in a referendum on a change in country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum was set up to settle a decade of conflict with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the same name of Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbours means that this claim is arising in the Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not accept the vote.
However, the supporter of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that the name change in the price to be paid for accession to the EU and the NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
"The old people I spoke to said in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Adams.
"Today there is no longer both of them."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was complete.
"The social life of people today looks different," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough for as long as the church leaders accept, and that they will “stand back at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments where people live who do not support the remaining refugees.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy property apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete conclusion of these churches, since it is unlikely that most of the people who enter into these property apartments become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropole: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist municipality took place in the 1930s.
A black community that held their religious services nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, leading a Boykott of retailers in the 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to set up or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when father Johnson's communal members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the watch game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his follower in St. Martin's, proudly described the watch game as “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who louded the watch game in July, used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "a unnecessary historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also found that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind. This was changed 18 years ago to the larger watch game in the Riverside Church.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated story with architects and contractors that were partly drawn to by the church leaders and partly by the Bishop diocese.
In July, the Governing Board of the municipality, which consists of the leadership of the municipality, expressed written concerns to the Diocese that the Diocese would try to transfer the costs to the Community board, although it had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors certified by the Diocese.
Some members of the community complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai hurt in California 13-year-old while diving to praise
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy during diving to praise.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the transmitter KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about a half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry of help and with several others paddled to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy shouted: “I have been bite!
I've been biten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire key leg was crushed.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flyed to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical state.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
The rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been seen in the area, but it had come to the conclusion that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
For investigation purposes and for safety reasons, officials locked the beach access of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but mostly they are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take advantage of the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks boats, superdrugs, and Debenhams with cosmetics that are occupied with specialized assistants.
In the context of a large precipitation on the UK’s 2,8 billion UK cosmetic market, which continues to grow, while mode and household product numbers fall, the larger cosmetic divisions will be tested in eleven branches across the country. If they are successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
Investment in cosmetics combines with the search of supermarkets for possibilities to use previously used shop areas for television, microwave and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's data, the range of its cosmetics for the first time doubles up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bee receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket performs a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique” so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's filial sales sites. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and another is opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the course of this year.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local needs articles means that supermarkets need to do more to make customers visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales offices will be increasingly like purchase houses, since the supermarket chain with more services and non-food articles is trying to fight the discounts Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has since purchased the chains Argos and habitat two years ago in hundreds of branches of Argos sales and also set up a number of habitat sales sites. This has increased food turnover and profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a dispute about the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches into the supermarkets ended.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 branches comprehensive pharmaceutical business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd Pharmacy chain, for 125 million British pounds three years ago.
The company argued that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in the event that a extended range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, is added in four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetic divisions to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues, which are available as advisors.
We are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchasing, as a result of the intriguing environment and the favourable locations."
Peter Jones “indignant” after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughbys from a business in the value of 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” Den” Star Peter Jones is “indignant” after the TV-moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million British pounds with his lifestyle brand company to concentrate on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby was anxious to “Dragons” Den” Star Peter Jones by their very short-term withdrawal from their lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been angry when the "Golden Girl" of the television, at a tense meeting on Tuesday in the central of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that it was not able to spend enough time on the common homewear and accessories brand Truly due to its new businesses – in the value of up to 1.5 million British pounds.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated asset of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly.
It should safeguard her future in the next decades for a long time.
Their decision for the withdrawal came completely surprising for all the stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the introduction of the market.
In the Marlow Central, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” modator, which is one of the most promising Stars of the UK, could cost the company millions because of high investments in products from kiss and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely acquainted with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the chairman in March.
The couples spend the vacation together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is intended to become brand messenger for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the moderner of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
One of Jones' nearby sources said last night: “We do not comment on his business matters.”
Heavy words "and then we have loved ourselves"
He shouted about the criticism that he was expecting from the news media for a comment that some would consider "non-president" and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a newsmoderator:
"I didn't give up."
He found that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a great step towards the Denuklearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have been brought to the floor.
Over three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, Ri Yong Ho, the High Diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North is not seeing a "consistent" response from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
Instead, he found that the United States held sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump proved much more optimistic in his advertising speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We stood before a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the missile tests, support in the release of hostages and the return of the mortal survivors of American military subjects.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to enter this overfilled arena, about 200 people would stand here,” said Trump and pointed to the crowd right ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
For example, after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were said they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were distributed from Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for mobilisation of international assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so that is something difficult," said Sumbung.
While saving the Children compil a team to travel to Palu, is not sure whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, spokesman of the Disaster Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international bodies should participate in the aid measures.
In view of the earth's shocks with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still unfortunately badly prepared for natural forces.
While aceh Tsunami protection accommodations were built, these are not a daily view on other coastal strips.
The evidently missing tsunami warnsiren in Palu, despite a warning in force, has likely contributed to deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge in the optimum case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A lazareth ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at least in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the affected Indonesian infrastructure the core part of his electoral campaign and has spent abundant money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the re-electing Yoko is suffering from financial deficits in the next year.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes and apartments, when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with Machenes, Arrows and Bogs as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation matches against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge delivered Liverpool on Saturday in the London Stamford Bridge City with a meeting in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a passport of Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1-back of his team in about 27 meters from the gate of Chelsea.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the back of the patch.
The shot sailed high over the penalty room and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for me.” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I have seen edges come and had a contact with the ball. I haven’t thought too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
Chelsea, after a hit in the 25th minute, led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard to the half-time with 1:0.
The Blues storm gave a passport with the fers back to Mateo, then turned off near the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpooler half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good bargain pass, so that the hazard got into the penalty room.
Hazard left the defendant behind and closed with a left shot at Liverpools Alisson Becker by the back of the network.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 in the Stadium of San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea is present on Thursday at 15:00 in London in the UEFA Europe League Videoton.
The number of deaths of the Tsunamis in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has increased to 832, as the disaster protection authority reported on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to have been captured in the ruins of buildings that had been disturbed by the earthquake of strength 7,5 from Friday, which had caused up to six meters of high waves, reports the government speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was surrounded with the ruined buildings.
Police arrests a man, 32, for murder suspects after a woman was caught up.
After finding a female body this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews at John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder suspects.
The police invite the inhabitants to report if they have seen or heard something.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early phase, but I ask everyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a dashcam, to contact us, and they may have information that is of the greatest importance for our investigation."
A police speaker confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and found in a building.
Today afternoon, friends who believe the woman have arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are running, and the police informed that it is about to inform the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but the police told that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The inhabitants are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard as a police officer said to a man that the whole area is now treated as a crime.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved in the place of events.
It repeats and repeats, "this is so terrible."
Two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle before the lockdown.
Within the lockdown, several police officers were watching the residential block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101 or to contact criminal stopers anonymously under number 0800 555 111 and refer to the Protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell state before Parliament becomes the latest monument of the dispute on the rewriting of history
Their exil would be poetical justice for his reminding destruction of the Taliban so many cultural and religious art products of England through its fanatic puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the image of Oliver Cromwell was the goal before the palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the British Civil Wars was not organized or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's dominant opinion and part of the history description of a figure, which is still worth being celebrated by many.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today than one who considers the Parliament against pressure from outside, of course through the monarchy, in his case.
Whether it is a completely relevant representation, it is the subject of continuing history debates.
Surely, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a individual detectable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer Schwein bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in the southwest of China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man who was only called the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a separate arterie flowing blood near a swine set on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China, a swine bowl is ready to inject pigs vaccines.
He was reporting on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring swine set was open.
He said that in the stall a big male pig was found with blood on the spot.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos heavy pig had eaten the farmers dead.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and shumbled,” the cousin called “Wu” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 o'clock to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager said the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiate reports on a compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 kilos heavy pig put a whale farmer in between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hide the animal.
After a farmer was eaten of his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could work as a “supplier”.
“They are only played.
They like to twist and are very curious, ... they are not going to hurt someone.
You just need to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurrikan Rosa bring widespread strong rain in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring rainfall in North Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coastal time, Rosa showed up wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to an orchid of category 1, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa moves north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins to form over the Pacific that moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical moisture is transported to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger rainfall in parts of Mexico up to 25 cm on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture produces in the coming days by interaction with the approaching trog widespread rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm rainfall can cause hazardous flooding, in the water driving shake and possibly cause grazing in the desert.
High tropical moisture leads to decline rates from almost 5 to 7,5 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 cm rainfall is expected.
Due to the spread of the tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flooding floods with rapidly worsening conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical rainfall, it is urgently recommended to walk into the desert.
Strong rainfall can result in canyons' cracking streams, and thunders bring local windbows as well as winds that lead dust with themselves.
The nearby trog brings locally strong rain in parts of the Southern California coast.
It is possible that total amounts of drops of more than one centimeter can lead to small amounts of water-driving treading and smooth railways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and stops on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature variations are possible throughout the United States, since the Arctic is cooling while the tropicals remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 °C.
In the next days, the continuing summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the United States, a warm October start is expected with widespread temperatures of 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of over-mean temperatures in the first half of October in the East of the United States.
Over 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million spectators saw on Thursday at six television networks the feasting statements of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patent situation stopped. The television broadcasters interrupted their regular program on Friday because of a turn in the last minute: one of Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, negotiated agreement, so that the FBI is supposed to carry out a weekly investigation of charges.
Ford announced to the Senate Legal Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, pushed her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million observers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company identified the average audience numbers in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had emitted the hearing, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring audiences in offices.
To get this into the right perspective: this corresponds to the number of viewers at a play-off football game or at the Oscar leasing.
The broadcaster Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderns strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, says Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing, recorded the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen 3,1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After publishing an explanation that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the office of the moderate Republican was filmed by cameras from CNN and CBS on Friday morning, how protesters pressed him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
For minutes, he stood with a lower look while he was scolded. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
"You have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said his office published an explanation and supplemented before the elevator concluded that he would have to say more at the hearing before the Committee.
All cable and radio networks sent live hours later when the Legal Committee should vote on the transmission of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote to the entire Senate.
But Flake said that he would do this only under the condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demands the accusations against the candidates in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by discussions with a friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, as it was evident that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump caused a FBI investigation of the accusations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using the Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans for withdrawal from the European Union to use the future of Great Britain for political purposes and to undermine the interests of the nation.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May joins the Conservative Party in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In addition to the interview with her on the title of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified its attack on its so-called "Chequers Plan" for the Brexit by calling a proposal which provides for the mutual entrance of customs duties by the United Kingdom and the EU as "whole absurd".
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspects Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned by the Baton Rouge police for death.
The authority published video records of the controversy between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS Partner Station WAFB reports, the police secured the glasses at the scene and said that the glass DNA was found by Simpson.
After Simpson's survey, the police stated that he was putting the deadly shots on Wayde.
The advocate reports that the deposit was fixed to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shot wound at the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Criminal Technical Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the Citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU Port Director Joe Alleva thanked the Regional Executive Authority for “their care and their pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m big wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he reached an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball trainer of the LSU said, Will Wade, that the team was "deeply shocked" over Waydes' death and "be under shock".
"You're always afraid of such a thing," said Wade.
Vulcan spys ashes in Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital has reached ashes emitted from the Vulcan Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and were registered within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ash.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grollen and shocks.
Images in social media showed thin ashes layers on the windshields of cars in fourths of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics, since a earthquake of strength shaken in September 2017 7.1 Central Mexico, discovered increased activity on the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital volcano.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before anniversary of independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after collisions between the Renaissance Police and Pro-Independence Demonstrants. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separators, which was retained by the Renaissance Police, conquered them with eggs and also swallowed colour powder, so that it developed in the streets normally populated by tourists dark dust clouds.
In the course of the day, there were also hands with the police who used their sleeves to reduce the fights.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups “No forget, no forgiveness” were scanned while they faced Unionists who called “Long Life Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen persons were treated for lesser injuries in the protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid saw as illegal, but celebrated by separateist catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very excited.
The voters had decided with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the election participation was low, since the division opponents mainly boocottated the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent voting in violent conflicts before the elections.
Pro-independency groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said that he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“The last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy because they could choose, but now we're hanging," he said.
Despite one important, though hard, victory at regional elections last December, the Catalan Pro-Independence Parties had difficulties this year to maintain the vibration. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest for the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been encountered by politicians on both sides.
"The situation becomes more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the election of Europe, it is the best way to condemn the democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government,” he said.

Menga Treffer means for Livingston 1:0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first port for Livingston secured the victory.
The risen Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas Hiter proved to be a decisive thing for Gary Holt's crew to be equal in the second half time with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains in the Prime Ministership in this season without foreign victory and is faced with the hearts that are left eight points on the next Sunday.
Previously on Thursday, the Rangers are hosts in the Europe League for Rapid Vienna.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his victory series in the Division to six games, i.e., that is, Chieftrainer Holt has not recorded any defeat since his overtake by Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misss chances against freely playing guests
Holt's team had to be in leadership long before the meeting, since his directness put the Rangers before various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had been down here to meet Craig Halkett's head shot at the gate.
The hosts satisfied to let the Rangers play in front of themselves because they knew that they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate arrived.
The Rangers allowed a free shot, and Livingston prepared a chance at which Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly brought Menga in shot position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty room.
During this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unhealthy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to defend.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers Torkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow swallowed the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks went to Livingston's penalty room and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required penalties – one of Halketts against Glenn Middleton and one for hand game – were refused.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Her way of playing and her team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt has a great commendation for the way he has wake up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as at times they were under Gerrard, they couldn't reach this standard.
Their last ball was inadequate – only once they could pass through the hosts’ crew – and this is like a call for the Rangers that are in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the rulers of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between the NATO alliances.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, press freedom and EU access to Turkey.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police named security reasons for having a mass of 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but many attendants came near to see their presidents.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurden – also heard. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as heroes and shamed by others as autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies in collision with car
When a car crashed, a cyclist in London died.
The collision took place around 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a transporting road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the Sanitarians cared for the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with driver flight in the Childers Street, about 1,6 kilometers from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to inform his next family.
Road locks and redirections for buses are set up, and car drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: six officials injured in disturbances
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in a high-security prison for men in disturbance.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. of British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stops.
Specialized "Tornado" officials were added to stop the disturbances involved in eight inmates who are limited to a wing.
The officials were treated locally for smaller injuries in the face.
One speaker of the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff was used to fix a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that police officers are being transferred and perhaps spending a longer time behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after an attack the prison manager was treated by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances where the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding floods (dry areas may benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but just that will probably happen at the beginning of the next week when the rest of Hurrikan Rosa moves across the southwest of the wilderness and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa approaches with rain on Monday evening and moves directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a Tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cycles have come near as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometres!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center are forecasting 5 to 10 cm rainfall with a single up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, which are characterized by deserts, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and individually possible up to 10 cm.
For those who do not have the risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are considerable, this rain is likely somewhat useful, since the southwest is now dry.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in some more than 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Afterwards, the hurricane will move 19 kilometres per hour north.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
Therefore, it is expected that Rosa meets on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The rainfall may be severe in parts of Mexico, so that there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall is expected from 7,5 to 15 cm, with up to 25 cm,” weather.com reported.
Then, as a tropical storm, Rosa will move northward over Mexico, reach the border to Arizona on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression and then move up to the south of Utah until the late Tuesday night through Arizona.
“As a main danger is expected to be very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert, and the southwest of the United States, which is characterized by deserts,” informed the National Hurricane Center.
As a result of these rainfall, life-threatening floods in the desert are expected to be flooded in the water and in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old stiff in Somerset, three boys in the teenage age and a 20-year-old man were arrested under the suspect of attempted murder.
The teenager was detected in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 p.m.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Wheelstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered "under the common, the anger" of the democratics.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the screwless and unhearted tactics of the democratics," said Trump at an advertising in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered during the entire nomination process "under the commonness, the anger" of the democratics.
Kavanaugh said on Thursday before the congress and pointed back the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he had sexually disturbed them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also said to her accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brillance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh this day.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirming one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the public,” he said the quantity of his attendants in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
I'm not walking in, but in reality I'm going on," he said.
"These is why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the democratics see their mission in "to resist and block".
The first important procedureal vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high staff of the GOP leadership to CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquakes in Indonesia, victims rise
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed, and many of them were disappeared as a result of a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit giant waves on the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a festival at the beach of the city of Palu when, when the darkness broke up to six meters high waves on the beach, many people rise to death and destroyed everything that was in their way.
The tsunami had preceded a earthquake of strength 7.5.
“When the threat of the tsunami came up yesterday, people still went on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell as a victim to him,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Disaster Protection Authority GBPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, he brought swimming cars, trees and houses, he met land everything,” said Nugroho. He added that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he met the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on the escape from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
Some 16.700 people were evacuated and stayed in 24 centres in Palu.
Air recordings published by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and crashed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shocked by further afterquakes.
The earthquake series was experienced in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a declaration that energy released from the massive earthquake from Friday was in line with the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, smal bay, the tsunami could have grown, said the Authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
According to his information, the bodies of some victims were found under the ruined buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages along the coast 300 km north of Palu could have been higher in a region called Donggala, close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralysed by Nugrohos, and no information was provided.
According to a statement from the Red Cross, there are more than 300,000 people, and its employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," said the explanation.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticised for not informing the fact that a tsunami Palu had hit, although the waves received official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man on the upper floor of a building, which desperately warns the people on the street under him from the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes of power a water wall on the shore and swimming buildings and cars of it.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami resulted in a massive power failure that interrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuators still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and was reopened for assistance only.
For Sunday, a visit by President Joko Widodo was planned in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami sacrifices has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the staff in tent accommodations are located in their office's courtyard, but, in words, dosebas came by scenes of destruction.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the helping groups started the hard task of launching the disaster aid, some assumed that professional foreign helpers would be obstructed on the journey to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supply and staff from abroad are only possible when the location of an accident has been declared to the national disaster area.
This hasn't happened until now.
“Now there is another disaster on the Provinces,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status does not apply until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami fell over Palu from Friday, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for them on one of the miracles that revealed the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been caught under crush for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the beginning of this month in Indonesia at the end of Asia games.
Others of the Roa-Roa hotel were prisoners, as Monday supplemented, his students.
“As a senior at the paragliding I have to wear my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told us how he in the hours after the message of the Roa Roa hotel crashed under the paragliders, desperately sent WhatsApp news to the contestants from Palu who attended the beach festival.
His news, however, led rather than to blue hooks, only to grey questionnaires.
“I think that means that the news has not been submitted,” he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
When announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (the officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears in the mission as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has resigned for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but it has a religious significance for the West according to its own statement.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” said West this year in a conversation about his album with Big Boy Radiomoderator.
“I am you, I am us, it are we.
From Kanye, which means “the only” only became ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the name Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which west has worked earlier, has also written his name with and without binding and uppercase.
Mexican AMLO commends not to use the military against civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed to never apply military violence against the civilian population during the 50th anniversary of bloody repressia against students in his country.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelco Plaza, “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration and killed 300 people. At that time, left-oriented student movements were working to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training possibilities brought to youths criminal bands.
The United States should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of the increased activities of China in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double their research expenditure in this field, says Investor and KI practitioners Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from various areas of the US Government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: The country intends to become the number 1 in the field of KI innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for the CI research would be a good beginning, given the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the United States. We are looking for the next CI break." said Lee.
Duplicating the financial resources could double the chances that the next major CI success would be achieved in the United States, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent CI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University at a KI system that defeated the highest placed American Othello player. Later he was the leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Google Release in China.
Lee deserved previous technology competitions from the US Government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to reading words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
“Not China takes away the academic peak forces, but the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have set up coryphes from universities to work on KI in recent years.
According to reading, a change in the US immigration policy could also be supportable for the US's KI efforts.
“I think that in the field of CI promoveed persons should be offered Greencards automatically”, he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technology (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to reading words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations to spend money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Defence Ministry established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science should be involved. The White House also announced the creation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced the investment of $2 billion in the "AI Next" initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million US dollars annually in the KI research.
In the meantime, US institutions have not done anything about the education of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on a change in country name
The people of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, which would attach a decade of old conflict with Greece which had blocked Macedonia's applications for entry into the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, who has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this right is to the Greek territory, so Greece has placed a veto against the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum. A Boykott campaign doubts that the election involvement achieves the 50 percent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was, "Are you for membership in the NATO and the EU by adopting the Agreement with Greece?"
The supporter of the amendment of names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argues that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the breakdown of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of entry into organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as it means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote result is not legally binding, enough Members have said that they would follow the result so that it is crucial.
The amendment of the name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that there were no reports on irregularities until 13.00 p.m.
However, the election participation was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 percent of the registered voters had voted.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko abandoned their vote in the referendum on the change of country name that Macedonia would open the way to accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, presented a small stage and presented chairs before tents set up by people who wanted to go boycott the referendum.
"We are for the NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the NATO membership will lead to investments that are urgently needed for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for it, since more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a 'yes' result would be a 'first confirmation of our future'.
According to a Monday survey by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian transmitter Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order to succeed in the referendum, the election participation must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A failure to refer to the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the policy of the pro-west government since its power acquisition in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvred through the entire Brighton defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero let his meeting look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He rushed between three Brighton defense players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defense and then took over several other defenses at the edge of the Brighton penalty room.
Then he shot a passport to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the punishment room to play the ball back to Aguero, who shot over Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton-torkeeper and shot into the right side of the network.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City-Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he reached a gate at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier-League-Duell.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to control Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues-Angreifer targeted the ball into the net just before he ran out.
City plays in the Champions-League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hopffenheim.
Scherzer wants to destroy the rockies
Since the nationals were excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force further effort.
However, the always powerful joker hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the rockies that have a game predominant before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies achieved at least one wildcard on Friday evening with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals, but still wants to secure their first division title.
“Though we play for nothing, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere of the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a start player for Sunday but are, according to reports, inclined to let gazers in such a situation.
Scherzer, for which this would be the 34th use as a start player, practiced on Thursday in the Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington Law Hand has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump holds announcement in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the board Kavanaugh selected for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big, large – I don't enter, but in fact I'm going to, so I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democracies, you see it happen now.
And they are determined to take over power with all the means, you see the commonness, the abomination.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to receive power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The democratics, he said, see their mission in "to resist and block".
“And you see this in the last four days,” he said and called the democratics “wrathful and common and awful and dishonestly.”
He named the highest democracy in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud calls at the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Oh, uh, something.
No, no, I'm waiting for one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer leaves all the opinions applicable.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of cheating me, this came little surprised.
Finally, I am the last one of a number of Labour delegates who are said they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly as she had resisted antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the tadle request for a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar topics that Jeremy did not agree with former top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that the meetings should all include and be productive.
Mostly the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as local Labour delegate were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today have not been characterized by this sound, and the promised 'friendlyer, more careful' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It becomes increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion will be assessed afterwards whether it is accepted by the party tip.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I believed to share similar political views now expected me to make a turnover and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say – a shimpftirade in the social media that calls for my choice, calls on the political center and says that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I feel better than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues who, every day, face a flood of sexist or racist disgraces and nevertheless contribute smallly.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that obstacles have become normality.
Jeremy Corbyn asked the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance last week.
In fact, we do not let all the opinions apply anymore, and with any distrust request and any change in the rule of election, the party becomes closer.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to draw my head and not express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have “no problems”.
But I did not go to politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student, caused by the negligence of the Thatcher government, because my classroom was literally distinguished in the overall school, the Labour Party joined, I have fought for better public services for those they need most urgently – as a municipality as well as as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a hole of my political views, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the request from Friday: in view of the fact that the country is going to rest on a brexit, to harm households, companies and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
Actually, I am not addressing this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, regardless of whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not stop so many choice threats or political thoughts from taking the best interest of all of you in my opinion.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tentent's Premiership.
You are now the only of the ten crews that are unsatsed at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of home teams was due to their superior defence as well as to their better use of chances, and trainer Peter Murchie had all reason to be satisfied.
“We have been put on the test in our games until now, and we are still unblowing, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they have better used their chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow map for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the warriors, let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot took an unincreased attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he achieved a hit right at half time and then achieved an increased attempt in the entrance, so it was for a break 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose, however, began the second half time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, a longer interruption occurred due to a severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field. After continuing, Ayr built his predicament through a Stafford McDowall-increased attempt by Climo.
Then, as Captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow map, and once again, at the end of a phase, Melrose gave the extra man an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the penalty gas from a touchdown behind the advanced Ayr package.
Climo increased as nearly since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's boxkick and flank player Gregor Henry sent for the fifth attempt of home crew.
“Still Game” star seems ready for new career in the gastronomy
“Still Game”Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the host industry after it was found that he was called the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, whose turnbooks he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles with his long-year-old Comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nineth staffel will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life to Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scottish Sun stated that Kiernan was interested in getting into Glasgow’s “florating restaurant” business.
“The sea belongs to us”: The Bolivia, which is included in the country, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Seasons patrol before the marine headquarters decorated with Tauwerk in La Paz.
On public buildings a more blue flag is wound.
Naval support points from Titicacasee to Amazon wear the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
Recovering it is a duty."
Overall in Bolivia, the memory of the 19th-century coastal section lost in a bloody conflict of resources in Chile is still as vital as the desire to go back over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court, which is to be held after five years of discussion on 1 October.
“Bolivia has the turn, a spirit of unity and quietness and expects the result of course with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will persecute the judgment of the IGH on large screens, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim, and according to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate over a sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea after decades of trackadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who is ahead of a controversial fight for his re-election next year, the judgment on Monday also plays a great role.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court decides in favour of Bolivia and believe that it would also change little.
The UN Organ with a seat in the Netherlands is not entitled to speak to Chilean territory and has established that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the IGH judgment has been held six months after the final plea, according to Paz Zárate, a chilenian expert on international law, suggests that the case was “not complicated”.
Apart from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also mean a relapse.
“The current Bolivian government has crushed the question of access to the sea,” said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warrior rhetoric has embossed any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their discussions, but after these events, this is going to be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President of Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in Den Haag, rejected the view that the decision of the Court was unusually falling.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “finish the 139 years of disputes for mutual advantage,” he said.
Calzadilla also argues that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the topic of the sea as a political crawl.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific”, he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disrupt its nuclear weapons first if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called the United States to make the promises made during a summit between the Heads of the Rivals in Singapore into acts.
His comments come at a time when the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be shortly ahead of us more than three months after the summit with the North Korean state leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore to restart the fast-run nuclear diplomacy.
Ri declared that further sanctions and the opposition of the United States against a declaration of the end of the Korean War would ever force the North into the knees, as 'Heirspinst'.
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without taking significant steps to disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngjang is serious with the absence of an arsenal where the country is likely to see the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pjöngjang for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect the sun completely, you don't have to look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy overwhelming head covers for their summer collection in 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fascinated the fashion week.
Extremely unpractical hats have flooded in this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creatures over the course.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-colored hat with a feather-like broad edge, which precisely pressed the heads of the models.
As other overdimensional accessories, water melons occupied with jewels, a magic hat and even ananas were shown, but they are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were equipped with cracked lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skine couture.
One creation was similar to a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a molten cube.
And if you want to set another huge fashion statement, you'll be lucky.
fashion observers forecast that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional hut follows directly to “La Bomba”, the Strohhut with 60 cm wide edge, which is all wearing from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely inpractical hat, which struck great waves in the social media, sent another large creation over the course: a beach bag from straw, which was almost as large as the bathing suit model that kept the bag.
The bastard in red orange with bast frans and a white leather hench was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer-2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris fashion week.
Prominent-Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large guards and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for overdimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens essential
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This continued with further outstanding test results in 2018 and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other Community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest level possible.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector, which can form a customised educational plan and actually implement, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, then you reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and confidence with people from other countries.
The current review results this year we find that languages with the highest survival rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A in the higher tests.
From the data collected by 74 SCIS members schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved note A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of the students learning German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages today are regarded as electoral qualifications as STEM professionals (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons which employers mentioned for the problems of occupational occupations were related to a lack of language skills.
Consequently, language skills are increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future profession.
Since more and more open jobs require languages, these knowledge are essential in a globalized world.
Depending on the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage through such a lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multiple-speaking people will automatically provide a predicament to competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason it is important for the children of today to invest in language lessons now.
Children speaking several languages, in particular languages of developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, in independent schools, a number of languages with appropriate specialized teachers will always be chosen.
Scotical independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and enables them to have the skills necessary for their success, as the future does.
At that time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication capability".
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this option, diversity and excellence.
I want the bees to be fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see how LeBron James arrives for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting will soon end.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the front season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet firm.
“It will be more than one and less than 48”," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twitted that James will probably only play a few minutes.
Early this week James was asked after training for his plans for the six games of the Lakers' whole seasonal play plan.
“I don’t need pre-seasonal games in this phase of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trumps Advertising in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of elections.
This is the first advertisement planned by Trumps five for the next week, including well-minded places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the swollen vote on confirmation of his choice for the vacation at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming semi-time elections in November, as the Republicans are at risk to lose control over the Congress.
When will Trumps advertising take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trumps' advertising in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trumps' advertising in West Virginia below as a livestream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably respond to the hearings of the Board Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court on accusations of sexual misbehavior that have been conducted this week in an excited atmosphere. The expected senate vote on confirmation remains up to a week in the sweve while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this series of advertising is to support Republicans who have to face difficult elections in November.
President Trump's electoral team to Reuters therefore stated that these five advertising issues will serve to mobilise volunteers and attendants in the next week, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
“The control of the Congress is so important for his plans that the President will travel to as many federal states as possible while the operational election season is approaching”, said a trump-walk fighter who did not want to call his name to Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate and report media from Pittsburgh, which are planned for this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling."
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the republic senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who are investigating.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to give him up in the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, Politologe at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows fighting willingness to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three unilateral rounds, the four parties on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The vibrant pendel of the momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one in which players really believe, and that especially in competitions like this.
So where is the momentum of their opinion now?
“They were in leadership with six points, and now it is four, so I think that means a little momentum for us,” said Jordan Spieth at leaving the playground.
Europe is of course in favour and is four points ahead, while twelve more follows.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can show three out of four points each.
Spieth was stubbornly strong from cutting down to green and goes forward with a good example.
The boyural enthusiasm cry was higher in the course of his round when he lowered an important put to decide the fourth match with four points for both, after he and Thomas had left two holes with two points.
His put, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry that makes it clear that the American team is not yet out of the game.
“I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game,” said Spieth.
That's all that remains for the individual players.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points as the only player in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal, but sympathetic Duo is four out of four points and cannot make anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was not the only couple that had not hit Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided the Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the behind nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly between them and the flowing quantity understood that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who will be sealing a possible European victory at the sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at various holes.
However, speaking of European glory would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the fourth hero of the morning playing with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and Sweden into a crush that they couldn't overcome nearly.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the crush.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating, because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don't give, and the way a strategy can change quickly, as fascinating from the vicinity.
The Europeans have played better as a team until now and are clearly in leadership on the last day, but this four round has also shown that the United States team is fighting, which some, especially in the United States, had doubted.
Europe is leading on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the fourth and fourth parties of Saturday to the United States, Europe is in front of 10:6 and goes with a solid predominance on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant playing Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the tiger Woods fighting with difficulties and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team mentioned by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the four in the morning against the defective American crew and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not recover the residue.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend, won only as the second Duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After they had beaten Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth, they harmonized excellently and struck the delicious Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had been dragging through two matches on Saturday, sometimes blowed up his brillance, but now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four parties and seven in sequence.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fourth morning, returned and played the four parties as partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring latch for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the fourth, they achieved a 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and struck Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four parties 4&3, after they had lost the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after it had entered the individual with a remnant of four points. However, as a title holder, Furyk's crew has a distinct way to keep the trophy.
After they have only been on the second place for two days, it doesn't seem as if they could start a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korea's Foreign Minister said that continuing sanctions would deepen their distrust with the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the Annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has taken important action in the last year, for example, has stopped nuclear and missile tests, cut down the nuclear test sites and has committed itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not, in any case, distinguish ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phase-wise” approach in the denuclearisation, when North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant when it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the beginning as it had done in the past.
Ri pointed to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim assured that the 'Denuklearisation of the Korean Peninsula' would be working on, while Trump promised warranties for the security of North Korea.
North Korea aims at an official end of the Korean war leading from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngang had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for a reduction in the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States stands on "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure by penalties to achieve their goal by force and are even against the "Declaration of the End of War", said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us into our knees is a brain spin of people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not enter into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US Head of State had highlighted at the beginning of the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State, Moon Jae-in, in the past five months, and added: "If South Korea, instead of the United States, would have been the other party in the Denuklearisation question, it would not have taken this stop when the Korean peninsula was denuclearized."
Yet, the sound of Ris speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles to the continent of the United States, after "the wicked President" Trump Kim had referred to as "raketman" for suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with the "whole destruction" of North Korea in the last year, overthrowd Kim with praise to the United Nations for his courage with regard to disarmament steps. However, he said that there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions to the denuclearization of North Korea should remain in force.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he has no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – does not matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngjang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must in any case be continued forcefully until we have reached the complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions towards North Korea since 2006 to dehydrate Pjöngjang's programmes for nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will visit Pjöngjang again next month in order to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said on the departure from Pjöngjang that progress had been made only for hours later to be accused of North Korea, he made "gangster-like demands".
North Korea commended this month at a moon meeting, a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took “matching measures”.
He said that Kim told him that the "consistent measures" desired were security guarantees given to Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year in primary study. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture, keeping up with caffeine and learning throughout the night.
One scientist has found that the students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to watching for themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes that the first such course is in the United States.
He was inspired to take the course into life after he had held a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“After the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I not know about it until now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me." he said to The Telegraph.
The course that took place this year first explained to the students how the foundations of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it had found that students were under severe sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the picture of a room in a home and click on coffee bags, pendants, training shoes and books. They receive information on the effect of caffeine and light, as well as on the impact of sleep shortage on the sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants find that long-term sleeping can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university site with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision affects your health," supplemented Professor Czeisler.
The pride of "suspending a nightlace" is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on students made the sleep deficit a growing problem.
In order to ensure adequate sleep, all students should have the "private weapon" against stress, exhaust and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, a weight increase could be avoided, as sleep detention puts the brain into hunger mode so that they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had done one of his courses last year in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push on a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgradual students will be invited to complete a similar study program before they start their study at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler's recommendation, students should have a wake-up for sleep and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" based on electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the tactic. This leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forces Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another outdoor game when the meeting of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrards meant a 0:1-degradation at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book its first outward victory since the 4:1 Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team was left eight points behind the hearts leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership with distance.
Menga met seven minutes before half time, and the inspiration arms of Rangers seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and lies only behind Hibernian at the Tordifference.
The Rangers also threatens further disturbance after liner judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object that seemed to be thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the crew, which Ayr overwhelmed and reached the halffinal of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same 11 Livingston players who took down the hearts a point in the last week, and should be enthusiastic as his well trained team kept their opponents on step and step under pressure.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball ownership, Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
You should have reached a gate after just two minutes when Mengas first issued Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's gate. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot.
Then a long run from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot by the back of the lobby.
The Rangers took over control, but their game was more hopeful in the last third than convinced.
Alfredo Morelos was evidently of the opinion that after a quarter of time he should have been punished because of a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Colombian.
In the first half of the time, the Rangers only got two traps, but the former Ibrox-Torhüter Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibalys headball and a tight shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's meeting in the 34th minute may not match the game history, it is not denied that they deserved him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers could not deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple grade.
Gerrard acted at half time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wing player Morelos put in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed out of his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to bring the guests to play exactly the game that lies to them, whereas Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's crew could have expanded its leadership in the last phase, but McGregor kept well standing and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a break after a lot of Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one page from our “Sunday Morning” Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as a geiger counter.
Since then, the geiger counter became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the film "Bells of Coronado" of 1950 with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is this?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that wears his name continues.
New cancer vaccine can help the immune system to “see” deflated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degraded cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degraded cells in the course of treatment.
In the method, immune cells that are changed in the laboratory are extracted to a patient.
These cells can see a lot of common proteins of cancer and then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect defiled cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is used to remove immune cells that are so altered in the laboratory that they can “see” the many types of cancer protein HER2. Afterwards, the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes growth of various types of cancer", including breast, eggstock, lung and intestinal cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped to treat leukaemia.

Kanye West was built up at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had praised widespread US president Donald Trump and said he wanted to enter as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had sung his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a shimpf-canonade against the democratics and again emphasized his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So, if I'd worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the mission with a Sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on the accusations of sexual injury raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the record of Wests Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded by comic Chris Rock to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun with the publication on West.
In addition, the West complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage for his head covering.
“They shaking me behind the stage.
They said, "Don't go out with the cap."
You screwed me!
And then they say I'm commissioning in a diminished area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Would you want to see the diminished area?” He said that he was going to “attract my supermancape, because that means that you can't tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments released at least two buh calls from the audience, and SNL members were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said to the magazine, "It became dead silent in the studio."
West was late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture of the title “I Love it” where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, and she twitted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKE, WHAT YOU MASSED APPLICATION TO THE MESSE.”
The Talkshow moderner Karen Hunter, however, twittered that west was simply he himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes a harmful ideology for my community, does not reward (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us.", she added.
Before the mission, the rapper had announced to Twitter that he had changed his name and now was “The being formally known as Kanye West” (the officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist who changes his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His raper colleague Snoop Dogg carried the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the dead music legend, changed his name into a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince" (The formerly known artist).

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington attacked toxic males
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword of swinging Jon Snow in HBOs by violence of a medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
The 31-year-old actress, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said that such rolls on the screen would have resulted in that boys would often have to feel strong to be respected.
In conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said that he believed something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic male manhood in the #MeToo periods.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, who was also involved in the "Game of Thrones", also 31, admitted that the solution of the problem was "very important".
“I personally find the question very important at the moment what has gone wrong with maleness,” he said.
“What have we trained growing men with regard to the problem we are now observing? ”
Harington believes that, due to the very maskulin character, television may partly be responsible for increasing toxicity.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling that this particular side of a man must be represented?
I think that is really one of the major questions of our time: how do we change that?
For the young men have clearly failed."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer, he would not participate in prequels or sequences by “Game of Thrones”. He has “real of battlefields and horses”.
From November Harington is seen in a new post by Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actress recently acknowledged that the best thing for him was to "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
“I have met my wife at this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the beloved of Harington's character Jon Snow, with many emmys.
The two married to Leslies family property in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has an increase of 14% in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in the majority of the new cases by sex.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who were infected with HIV in this way had almost decreased to zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the discrimination of members of the LGBT community is supposed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are finally married women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government, among other things, has promised general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters stresses the fact that employees have made the data of the GOP sensors dilute, criticizing "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, Member of the US Representative House, argues on Saturday that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three Republican US Senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The democracy from Los Angeles believed that the claims of “ultra-justified” experts and websites would be distributed.
“Lieves, liars and more horrible liars,” said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The published information should contain the private addresses and phone numbers of the US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the accusations against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual errors raised by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators Kavanaugh had consulted.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifys the source of contributions is assigned to Water’s office and published the information of a member of Water’s staff, reported The Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a absolute lie” continued Waters.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for the search of these information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a absolute lie."
Waters’ Declaration prompted criticism online, including those of Ari Fleischer, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
Those who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You can't be proud.
You must not question the motive of the prosecutor.
You must be quiet and left."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the democratics to Judge Kavanaugh, which was accused by critics of being angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who enters in the mid-term elections to dissolve waters, expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if it is true," he twitted.
Waters said in its statement that their office informed the competent authorities and criminal prosecution authorities about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the transgressors are revealed,” she continued, “and they will be accounted for all their actions which are devastating and dangerous for all members of my staff.”
Criticism about “Johnny English – You Live only three times” – weak spionage parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit references in any British colored new film. This also seems to apply to this re-experience of the action combodies parodie French cheese “Johnny English”, which started in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion who made it” and, in 2011, with “Johnny English – now only right” retarding.
Will an ironic self-parodie, as obviously we are, be a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grimassen cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema seekers in non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the controversial secret agent, who, bizarrely, thinks he is cool and worldly human, while he actually consists of something Clouseau, a price Mr. Bean and a crack of this guy, who contributed to the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in London in 2012, a single note on the title melodie of “The hour of the winner”.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of resigning travelers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the currently forgotten Barclaycard remote spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached his helmet in a medieval army and the rotor leaves.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics is present, but the humor seems quite weak and strangely overflood, especially because also the "serious" film series such as "007" and "mission inappropriate" are now offering self-safe comodiatical elements.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy misconducts are not as influential and focused as Atkinson's stupid film gags in the role of the Bean.
The everlasting premise is now that Great Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker infiltrates the super secret British spying network and reveals the identitys of all British agents in use, very to misplease the service agent, unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strohhalm for the Prime Minister, a blowed and distressed figure already standing before the complete breakdown because of her political in popularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not give much to that she can work with
Their Secret Service Advisors inform them that all active spies have been defiled and must therefore get someone out of retirement.
This includes the tolerant Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher in a sent institution, but is inofficial in the work of a subcover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a "School of Rock" academy of the Spionage Academy.
English is brought back to a emergency meeting to Whitehall and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-Boot commander, a nervous woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are in action again. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously engaging in the ban of a charismatic Tech millionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough begin their Odyssee of the big-sized spots: As a kellner, they burn a good French restaurant, they care for chaos when they smuggle on board Voltas luxury yacht, and English tries to make pure anarchy when he tries to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already detailedly handled in the children's television.
Pretty moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, ‘Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that really will meet his talent?’
Labour strives to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week but pay for five days.
The party wishes to report that corporate leaders will forward the savings achieved by the KI Revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country in favour of workers.
The change to a four-day week was promoted by the Trades Union Congress (Trades Union Congress) as an opportunity for workers to use the benefits of the changing economy.
A high level source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: “At the end of the year, a directive test is expected to be announced.
"A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an endeavour that is consistent with the approach of the Party to restore the economic balance in favour of workers and with the General Industrial Strategy of the Party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party who supports such an idea. The Green Party already promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party informed: "In a 4-day week it is not party policy and it is not considered by the Party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his view of a socialist revolution in the economy in the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonymous directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The shadow cancellator's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their entire share, since a Labour government could take off due to suspected misconducts.
He also confirmed the plans of calling workers into the boards of companies and setting up Inclusive Ownership Funds in order to transfer 10% of private enterprises' own resources to the employees who are depositing annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the newsmagazine "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation could change their opinion in the case of Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has deferred a final vote on his appointment to the Judge of the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority might influence republic senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60 minute Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the republic senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could make something to do, which could ultimately change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I informed in the negotiation that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was expressed, and asked if he did.
He was decisive, determined and indispensable."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be stitched in stone.
“My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to place a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has contested this vehement," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called it could not confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and was contributed to reducing poverty during this festival?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York to fight an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the occurrences of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to sharpen the consciousness of the actual objective of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project. In the context of this project, an international stakeholder group is trying to fight poverty by increasingly motivating more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To receive a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you must complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project if you consider that global citizens remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea to put a cool free concert in view, a meaningful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think to change something by signing a online petition or sending a Tweet?
Global citizens informed that the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and to achieve various objectives.
These actions are supposed to have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and strategies in the value of more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, from which at least 10 billion US dollars were already paid or purchased by fundraising.
According to the group's estimates, the secured funds have been directly affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom, which have committed to support children in their optimum development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million US dollars fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4.700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history”, the ambassadors of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 actions in order to invite the UK to improve the dietary situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, which is intended to achieve 5 million women and children and provide food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, the question of what are the reasons why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They answered: “There will be a long and harsh way with heights and depths.
But, like the large movements of civil rights and anti-partity before us, we will be successful, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists that are present during this year's event in New York. With this, Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are also moderns.
The United States could use the Navy for blockade purposes to impair Russian energy exports – the Ministry of Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington is able to react to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia can not reach the markets including the Middle East, the US Indian Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is an obstacle to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working on the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s use in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are means and ways to deal with this.
“The United States can, together with the Marine, ensure that the seaways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he informed.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which understands itself as “the time of the electricity consumers” in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found them practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said while he described Russia as “One Trick Pony” with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was expanding the export of fluid gas to Europe and thus replacing Russia, the much more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unprecedented" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became a "catching" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2-pipeline value of $11 billion, which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exercising pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counterwind from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of the German Industry (BDI), has invited the United States to keep out of EU energy policy and bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supply," says the BDI Dieter Kempf's Board after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Wladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants a presidential candidate for 2020 “examining,” says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examined" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considers a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and this includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "examine closely" a presidential candidate after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump directs this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very worried about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in their criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course a FBI investigation is necessary.
However, a Thursday survey showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe it should be candidate for 2020.
According to the survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be awarded.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of the former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting potential candidates, and 48 per cent who are opposed.
The other names of prominent democracies, which are in question for a possible candidate to 2020, include the former Vice-President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide until January.
Sarah Palin comments on the Donald Trump-Ralley for posttraumatic burden disorder, under which Track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son gets through, what he gets through, when he comes back, all that can emphasize other families who feel the effects of the PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she informed the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "Elephant in the space" and said about their son and other war veterans that they return changedly, that they return abruptly, that they come back and wonder if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given to the country.
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with a woman for domestic violence, says Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police authority of Wasilla.
18 Federal States and D.C. support a legal assistance to the new asylum policy
18 Federal States and the District of Columbia support a legal assistance to the new US policy that refuses victims of band activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 Federal States and the District received a judicial expert statement on Friday in Washington to support an asylum applicant who questioned the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace counter-session complaint submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not announced.
She informed that her partner “and his violent band sons” abused them, but U.S. officials refused their asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where very many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations who have to fight with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy took up a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, Karl Racine, the General Federal Advocate of the District of Columbia, said that the new policy “ignored decades of legislation at state, federal and international level”.
“The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances of the application, and that court is violating this principle”, was stated in the Court's Declaration.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refused access to the country would have a negative impact on the US economy, as immigrants could rather operate as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workers.
Advocate General-General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal bands no longer grant asylum.
“Asyl exists for all who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or fearful because of race, religion, nationality or association with a particular social group or political conviction,” said Sessions in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to deflate all the problems by giving asylum, even all serious problems with which people have to fight worldwide every day.
Desperate trials of salvation in Palu, as the number of deaths in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very excited,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and calms her little fevering son in a rescue center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance with the dead comes.
Clean drinking water is short."
Inhabitants returned to their devastated houses to collect their nearest possessions and goods and to save everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals, which were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who increased spinal fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside of the Palu military hospital, where patients were treated in the outer grounds because of the persistent strong decay.
With tears in his eyes he told how the violent earthquake shaken the hotel room in the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It all went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the walls that arrived," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Messenger complains China of the Tyrannei with “Propaganda advertising”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had launched a four-sided ad in an American newspaper in which the mutual advantages of trade between the USA and China were announced, the U.S. messenger in China accused the country capital of Beijing to use the American press for progaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump was referring last Wednesday to the refund of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after accusing China to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6th, a charge that defies China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing has tried to intervene in the US elections correspond to the communication from US officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered from Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise advertising for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a vigorous trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. messenger in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, who exports largely agricultural products to China, notified that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies.
China, as Branstad in a statement in Des Moines Registry of Sunday, doubles this tyranny now by turning propaganda ads into its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of the free expression and the independent press in America by switching the country's advertising in the Moines register,” wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, you will only find in a limited number of contradictions here in Beijing at the newspaper skisques and not really reflect the different opinions that Chinese might have about the disturbing economic development of China, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most well-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republics proclaim voters from the intermediate elections with the Debakel around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a reaction during the coming interim elections, which might be based in particular on women.
The mood in this context was extremely excited, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue by a vote.
"Some things can't be undoed," Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts that the last minute advance of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for a FBI investigation to address angry voters.
“Womens do not forget what was yesterday, they do not forget it tomorrow and not in November”, said the newspaper in Washington, D.C., on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called in the walking area of the Senate “November is coming” when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported that despite the statement of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, informed Stu Rothenberg, an unpartial political observer of the news page.
"The people say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially with voters in the premises and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which their accusations of sexual attack against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers stated that a reaction could result if the Republicans propose confirmation.
"This situation is a distortion for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week.
"It is not only about the vote of the body, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also about the way the Republicans have handled it and how they treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of priorities in the United States, a group that supports the election of democracies, to the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree with who they are supposed to believe on the basis of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or likely to give Kavanaugh faith.
In addition, 38 % stated that they believe that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying in its statement, while 30 % indicated the same about Ford.
Following the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations brought by Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week before the Senate Legal Committee, Ford issued an occupational statement that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed its genitals to her when they were at a party during their study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently bringing a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee bestowed that the intention behind Inrupt was the “world rulership”.
"We have to become active now," he said on the topic startup.

The app uses Solid technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library and other tools for private and business.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content are available in a browser and at the same time.
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access what data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to the CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate capabilities so that Solid is available for all.
The company is currently Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up for the work on this project, as well as a Community voluntary programmer. A safety platform acquired by IBM is also used.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee informed that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made where their entire business models will be completely transformed overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution on the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994 Berners-Lee provided a new design of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was majorly involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very confident with regard to this new era of the Web”, he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carryer of the Victoria Cross in the First World War, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded as a fighter with the Victoria Cross during the First World War, was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Leutnant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his operation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sharp shooter and had never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, a memorial stone.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, felt that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his bataillon over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through thick fog and heavy shots of field cannons and machine weapons.
Later he approached the fire line and led the line forward with the "master braveness" before he accelerated with a field weapon in the entrance and disabled three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918 by a German scarf shooter; a little more than a month before the end of war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something that he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes a person humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he put a crance down after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann argued that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the braveness of a real hero, especially through the support of many people, becomes visible.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there were Peppa Pig
Imagine you've stayed awake all night to see an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The bill of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was delivered live all night in the United Kingdom to Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not astonished as plots of pepper pig were seen.
Some remained unaffected after they stayed awake until the early mornings to see the struggle specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the change to the trick film figure as a somewhat bad joke.
“Due to a regulation of the government, these content are considered not youthless, so that it had to be switched to a child's broadcast at 6 o'clock,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was consulted on the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Corporate Board of Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will process the run-out plan in order to take future account of viewers from the United Kingdom.
“I think the problem could have been solved during the repeat game,” he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on one Sunday at the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the event until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying there.
In the change, there was a lot of communication. It was pretty twisted and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem and have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What wasn't the case, it was a problem of the government.
I promise, this will not happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels more sexy
Tom Daley, who participated as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being underlying all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at the continuing school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became father, the victories in the Olympics are no longer so important for him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses disease-related for a few months.
In the first mission of Laverne, he said that he had previously regarded himself as inappropriate in comparison with others, since love for boys and girls was socially unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of being underlying and different from the others is reason for my power and strength and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he expressed his opinion on this topic because he is happy to live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The three-fold world champion was in love with the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013. Knowledge to be in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner, but he shared that the age difference had never been a topic.
He believes that if you had so much to do as a child and youth – he took part in the Olympics for the first time with 14 years and his father died three years later in cancer, it is difficult to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has a son who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Last year, everything had been about gold medals with him.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearby death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012, since he wanted to be in the front.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
“I kept his hand when he quit breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he was not indefeated,” he continued.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal in the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew that it was always my dream of dyking in Olympic games before the local audience – that was the crazy one,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in the front of the Olympics and still provided for gans skin.

Mickelson, who is not currently in form, is sitting at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must strive very hard so that it doesn't become a debakel.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the center of the event, the five-fold Majorman spent his day on fireing others and working on his game, in the hope of fixing the problems that burden him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the directest golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National Gulf Square, where misleaded balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn't discouraging enough, Mickelson in the ninth game meets on Sunday on the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined with Tommy Fleetwood, Newling in these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points put back to the 12 single games a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfect about his role today in clearness, gave me a knock on my back and laid his arm around me and felt he was ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“He has quite a lot of confidence.
He belongs to the world-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I hadn't thought he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went, and that's what we've expected.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldo record for most Ryder Cup games that have been carried out on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup runway that never completely matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk told that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He is funny and sarcastic, original, and he likes to make a few bitches, and he is a great man who is popular throughout the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person who gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows it can be over soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows out of experience that a great advance that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become a unpleasant situation.
In 1997, the Dane debuted in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point precipitation against the Americans, but only came closely across the target line and went into leadership with the smallest possible predominance and reached a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The idea remains that we had a great predicament in Valderrama, we had a great predicament in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only a little,” said Bjørn (pictured on the photo), after he had seen the victory 5-3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all team members that it is not over.
It's going to be right tomorrow.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole is only over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're fully aware of what is against us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance of his players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overcome it.
Tomorrow, another caliber will be.
Tomorrow, the individual services are in the forefront, and this is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things work well, but if you're out there alone, you'll be tested up to the limits of your ability as a golfer.
You must make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart over Jim Furyk will ensure that his players cut off individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turners on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner side before he stood on the sides of the losers after Europe's “Wonder of Medinah”.
"I remember every fucking word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the fast start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to the task of bringing forward to the counterfeit, he has to join in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranging list.
"I have decided for the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is again delayed
The latest fregatte of the German Navy should have been served in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years of the Cold War. However, it is delivered by local media due to defective systems and rapidly growing costs only at the beginning of the next year.
The entry into service of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the headship of the brand new fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was now deferred to the first half of 2019, according to the time of a military speaker.
The ship should have been put in service in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems was plagued after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, already ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a number of flight defence missiles and sea target aircraft, as well as tarn technologies such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the persistent delays may lead to the expiry of the high-modern warships, which are supposed to constitute Germany as a sea force, at the time of their launch, says The Time.
The Fregatte F125, followed by the accident, came into the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and it returned to the shipship Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little known about the reasons for return, but German media called a number of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have made the new ship unusable in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are used by a crew of only 120 matroses, only about half as many as on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance injury and prevents the Marine from implementing restructuring measures in the future.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" seemed to be twice as difficult as ships with a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, were also a problem.
It seems that the costs increased to €3.1 billion, compared to €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the sea power of Germany is shrinking.
In the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartel, the German Bundestag's Responsor, confirmed that the Navy “outgoes the operational vessels”.
Bartels said that the problem became bigger in time, since old ships were taken out of service but no substitute ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken off by the Marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the Fledermouse
In a property in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature protection activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will trace dwarf and mosquitoe mice as well as the brown long-ear and water-fleather mice in Invereve Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the land to record the activities of the bats during the whole season.
Personnel of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
A noise analysis of all recordings by experts determines and determines the frequency of the bats calls.
Afterwards, a map and a report of the living area are drawn up in order to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Natural Protection Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for the baths and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine and demonstrate the benefits of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of pastures, and how to obtain forest areas for bathing and other related species.
The Fledermouse stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk, like flying catches and chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by house cats.
Fledermouses are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an outstanding ecotype to detect insects and obstacles in their railways.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the subject of the bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who conduct regular investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organization has even set up Scotland's first and only Fledermaus reserve in the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland's 10 Fledermaus species.
Goods Manager David Thompson explains that the possession of the ideal living space is for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there are many things we don't know about bats yet, so we do these work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He stresses the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nest place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and eliminate the entire population in the area.
Fledermouses are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to harm them or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to assist.
She explains: “We have to learn a lot about bats, and in many of our species we don’t know how it is about their population.”
Ronaldo disputes rape claims while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape assassinations against him as “Fake News” and said that people want to “be famous” by the use of his name.
His lawyers plan to accuse the newsmagazine The mirror, which published the charges.
The storms of the Portuguese National Team and Juventus Turin were accused of raped a American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He said he paid her $375,000 to buy her silence for the incident, said The mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video on his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo named the reports only hours after their publication as "Fake News".
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-fold winner of the ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves through the use of my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse the mirror due to the accusations they referred to as, according to Reuters, "inappropriate reporting on suspicions in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a replacement for “moral damage in a height that corresponds to the severity of infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The claimed event was supposed to have occurred in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After they had met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to have gone to the player's room, where he had rape them, according to documents submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the claimed incident Ronaldo went to the knee and she said that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries at a hospital but later joined an unjustified agreement, since she had “anxiety of revenge” and was concerned about being “publicly degraded”.
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to withdraw the agreement because it was still traumatic because of the claimed incident.
Ronaldo was just before changing from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the claimed event and changed this summer into a 100 million euros heavy deal to the Italian Giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘repent forever’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “remorse forever” if it loses its status as a global leading manufacturer of cars after the Brexit, says Minister of Economic Affairs, Greg Clark.
He further said that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would interrupt production in Burnaston at Derby temporarily, Britain should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," says Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer argued that the impact of delays at the border on a non-deal break could lead to loss of jobs.
The work in Burnaston, where Toyota's product lines are produced Auris and Avensis, finished almost 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our work at the end of March,” says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager in Burnaston.
Other British automobile manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also caused fears of a harsh EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that it will close his mini work in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are associated with risks within the supply chain with a hard brexit.
Toyota's manufacturing plant is operated on a “Just-in-Time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and the EU to complete the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, it could cause interruptions that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and paces in the parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to run a stock stock in Derbyshire, which was longer than one day, explained the company why production would have to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May's Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is “exactly designed to avoid such controls at the border.”
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables us to enjoy not only the current success but also take this chance,” he explained in the BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers show that we have to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not indicate how long production should be interrupted, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and eventually lead to loss of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functionary of the Unite Society, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs never come back when they are gone.
One government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trumps planned meetings with Rosenstein could be replaced according to the White House's details
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be “replaced for another week” while the fight for the candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, it said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has investigated the work of specialist Robert Mueller, who examined Russia's elections, the connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as the President's possible disability of justice.
The question whether Trump fires the Minister of Vice-Jurisdiction and thereby threatening Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secret recording of his conversations with Trump and the President's official collection by means of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his supposed withdrawal were known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was at this time at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was announced for the next Thursday,
Trump declared that he would prefer not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflicting with the hearing before the U.S. Senat's Legal Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse.
On Friday, Trump arranged a weekly FBI examination of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps press speaker Sarah Sanders released on Sunday on Fox News.
She answered a question about Rosenstein's meeting: “A date has not yet been set, but it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be shifted by another week, in view of all the things that are just taking place with the Supreme Court.
That's what's going to happen, but I always like to keep the press on the running."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has no longer held the White House press conference since 10 September.
Moterator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences does not impose a rejection to the "effect hackery" of the TV reporters, but admitted: "I would not dispute that they are engaged in effect hackery."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would grow.
The President makes more question-and-response rounds than any President before him," she explained without exact evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Press conferences will still be held, says Sanders, but if it is “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, but far better than speaking to me.
We are trying to do this frequently and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting hosts.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he brought a stranger and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes because of Brexit's thoughts about EU employers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health is addressed to those from abroad who work in Scotland National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express their desire to remain in the country after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom expired from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself ready to carry the costs of applications for residence titles for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
Freeman wrote in your letter: “In the course of the summer, the exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible No-Deal scenario.
I am aware of what anxiety times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and also offer valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and thus benefit the patients and communities whom we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was subject to a emergency surgery after a head injury
The linebacker of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to the information of Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was subject to an emergency operation on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, head trainer of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the sideline and just broke up there," said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before he was placed on a cargo and transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie left the OP in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “not yet details of nature or extent of injury” are known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching over from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 thankles, thus increasing his total in the season to 18 thankles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp taxes for the real estate purchase in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay higher stamp taxes for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom in the future.
This step is designed to end the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects more than 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will today announce that foreign investors have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the United Kingdom, where the added income will benefit homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to impress Jeremy Corbyn's success with young choosers who promise to provide more affordable living rooms and to take top earners into the vision.
The increase in stamp tax will be charged on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current stamp tax, including the increase in two years ago on two-purpose apartments and the rental property, the surcharge could be up to 3 per cent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected by the step with added revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13 percent of newly built property in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. Thus the prices are driven up and it is more difficult for first buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers, most of which spend outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson expressed a reduction in the tax on stamp to allow more young people to get the first home.
He accused construction companies to maintain the real estate prices by buying up land without using it, and he urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the "residency disgrace" of the United Kingdom.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an exciting number of proposals for living room reforms that are sufficient from a rental price commitment to the prohibition of rooms without a reason.
He also wants to give city trees more powers to build new apartments.
May explained: “I said last year that I would devote my time as Prime Minister to the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that means to repair our broken apartment market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be correct that it is equally easy for people who do not live in Great Britain and for companies with a seat abroad to buy property as well as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for too many people and the invaluability of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, Chief of Sunderland, says that it was his ‘larst goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at any time.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of entering the association from the northeast of England, which is just on the third place in League One and lacks the three points at the top.
He moved to the stadium of Light this summer after he led St. Mirren back to the first Scottish Liga in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed to go to the bank and that was 's'," said Ross of the BBC Scotland's Sending Sport Sound.
“But when I was a child, I often saw Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and this is something that always draws me back.
However, this option would only come if I would be successful in association management."
Ros's predecessors in the role of Sunderland are Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic stated that he was not afraid to go into the footsteps of such a set name in such a club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will now be measured by whether I can bring the association back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and the possibilities in this association, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he explained.
"It's not easy to get him there, but I'd probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I bring the association back there."
Ross can present a only three-year management career, after a phase as vice-president at Dumbarton and a 15-month work as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the border of the relegation to win the mastership in the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"This was probably a real way of divorce," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I did not get bad, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things that you have to go through every week.
I still do this with regard to stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it. I've never felt so well in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30, so a study
The heat wave in the summer missed the revenues of British cruel pubs, while restaurant chains were under bigger pressure.
In July, pub and bar companies recorded a sales growth of 2.7 percent. However, the revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the Corporate Advisory CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: “Continuing sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June in which the pub’s turnover increases of 2.8 per cent could be recorded.
The decrease of 1.8 percent, which the restaurant industry recorded in June, increased further in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed with distance the best performance, with an area-adjusted turnover development that increased higher than they fell at the restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food were also left in the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It seems that the people were just trying to go for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the sale of food fell by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, analytics for the RSM recreational and hosting industry, explained: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sports events remain the largest factors for turnover in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight with problems, but sales rates of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come on food at any worse time for operators of companies with a focus and it would still be waiting for the more tempered temperatures to provide the urgently needed atmosphere in August."
The total turnover growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected the decline in the brand rollouts.
The industry turnover monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One out of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keeps it secret to parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in further schools has found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fires fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that can keep it secret before adults.
A survey among 20,000 students in further schools showed a rapid increase of so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, a link to the Photo Sharing website Instagram.
The message fires anxiety that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to “rape me.”
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmasters’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, allowing half to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of the HMC, explained: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are led to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes “Stimme of the athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member at the Council of Scottish Athletics (Scottish Athletics) at its annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding athlete and President Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the light athlete community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that light athletes in Scotland would benefit very much from their elections in the Council”, says Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and guide sports in Scotland.”
The American who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, named four Olympic Gold Medals his own and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell me whether or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to run again, and do motion exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A producer of milk pumps provided excitement in the network with a advertising clip in which breast-feeding mothers are compared to the milking of cows.
In order to introduce the market, according to the ‘World-World-World-World-World-World-Noise-Large-Low Pump’, the producers of consumer technology Elvie published a not very serious common music video to emphasise the freedom that gives the pump breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shirt filled with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text like: “Yes, I milk, but you don’t see a cock at me” or “if you have not noticed it, these are not yours but my breasts.”
The Refrain continues: “Pumpe it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has launched a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions with the viewers, many of which say that it is harmless for the “frighting” of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within a few days after birth," said a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits in a Still-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment said: “Nachwhile traumatic for mother and baby.
But, hey, why don't we use them to apply a milk pump for mothers that can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a reality stranger advertising."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song "urcomatic".
“I think that is a brilliant idea.
I would've bought one if I'd still breast-feed.
When I pumped off, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertising that is addressed to mothers, using milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feels like “cows”.
This is not an advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that all have danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate that they feel like milk cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is completely noiseless, has no wires or snakes, and fits discreetly into a Still-BH, thus giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with Mother, explained: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a violent and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to put milk pumps and all the challenges involved, and at the same time present the incredible feeling of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that the pump of Elvie got into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-fold mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly brought to a tent town at the Mexican border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossovers has remained relatively equal, among other things, since increased rhetoric and the measures of the Trump Government have made it more difficult to spend children with maintainers.
Traditionally, most maintainers were illegal immigrants themselves and are now afraid to become even the target for an exhibition when they report to take up a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their household had to issue their fingerprints and that data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the customs authority immigration and customs enforcement, declared before the convention that the authority arrested dozens of people who had acquired care for unmarried minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested persons had no previous records in the criminal register.
“Only 80 percent of those who are either self-maintained or members of a household of an maintainer are illegally in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to persecute these people," explained Albence.
In order to be able to handle the cases of children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules which, according to the staff of the accommodation of some children, require to appear before the court within a month, instead of 60 days after the arrest, which was the preliminary standard.
Many will appear by video switching and not personally to enter before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decisions, the person will be quickly disposed of.
The longer these children remain in caution, the more likely it is, according to the information of accommodation employees, as well as reports that have been known from the system in the last month that they are worried and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defendants say that these concerns are strengthened in a larger institution such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems are easily ignored due to the size.
They also explained that it could reinforce the trauma, which many of the children already suffer, if they were brought to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘mansion troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-President Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces are illegally treated on Syrian ground with the suggestion of the fight against terrorism and are treated accordingly.
“You must withdraw immediately and without precondition,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have been driven out of their homes.
He said that Damascus will “fight this sacred battle until all Syrian areas are cleaned” by both terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish armies and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soil troops in the war cultivated country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem declared that the conditions for their return were given and he accused “some Western countries” to “spread irrational fears” to stop refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow return," he explained.
"They are politicians of a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union were warned that there was no construction aid for Syria until there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last big rebel hoochburg Idlib represents the possibility of promoting political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had clear deadlines and expressed its hope that military measures against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front, connected with Al-Qaeda, “will be deleted”.
UN-Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to invite the first meetings of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to design a constitution of post-war for Syria and to open the way to elections.
Moualem stated the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the Committee and declared that its work should be limited to the "review of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win its re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, end an official hearing or a scandal his Presidency in advance.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a Presidency of all times”.
So far there are no signs that it would have satisfied the spectators.
Since 2014, the circulation rates for the best time of sending in CNN have increased to 1.05 million more than doubled and at MSNBC to 1.6 million have been almost threefold.
According to Nielsen, Fox News achieves an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time of sending, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” led to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is like a fire that the people wear magic, as it is something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series "Designed Survivor" on a cabinet member, which will be president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-prepared comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking In the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She recalls a taxi tour in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘for he's bringing me to laugh’’,” said Scovell to me.
The chaos has the value of entertainment.
Of course, the Washington stories can, in contrast to everything that is found in television, determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible merger of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes to be an informed citizen if you are aware of having seen six hours of an expert round, using Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called 'Deep Background' for its book 'Fear', Paul Manaforts $15,000 expensive bomber jacket from Straußenleder (as reported in Washington Post), or the effects of Stormy Daniel's ridiculous description of Trumps, discussed anatomy.
For my part, I will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“A part of what he does, it can feel like a reality show that he presents to you every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, the main business leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trumps rotating occupation and daily actions (a struggle with the football lia NFL breaks from the door, commencing Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a result, or you're not going with it anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, there were sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he caught himself inside and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could simply not resolve himself from the screen, not when Judge Kandidat Brett Kavanaugh was briefly proclaiming before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we made all these crazy missions and the people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” said Fleiss.
"I thought that was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Spending money flows the closest races around seats in the convention at the intermediate elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is flooded by donations, thanks to the newly withdrawn borders of the electoral district, which led to two officials in the race around the same seat.
The newly drawn suburb district in Pittsburg allows the Democrats Conor Lamb to enter, who won its seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is strongly crossing with the new 17th district.
The cards were rearranged after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were disputed against the Constitution and manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district led to a struggle exchange of electoral funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tough victory in a highly respected special election in March around the 18th district of the State.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and the Trump won there with 20 percent points of advance.

The United States examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then resigned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized without a great resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump completed a friendly meeting with the president of Panama Juan Carlos Valero and had a hotel in Panama until partner was thrown out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all American foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the latest decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, ministerial spokesman at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, criminal action was considered to be $140 million of US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, Northern and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity which should follow a similar congregation in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now appointed as speaker at the conference held at mid-October to set a sign of the importance of the government of the congregation, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives are quietly returning to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new disclosures or criminal actions from Washington.
A government speaker of John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to express themselves on internal meetings under the condition of anonymity.
Their opinions were confirmed by an external analytist close to the government, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report of specialist Robert Mueller on Trumps of judicial disability for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller now claims to examine whether Trump's electoral team with Russia was conspiring in its attack on the American elections.
If the majority of the conventions change, Trump is faced with an institution that forces him to be accountable, exactly at the time when he goes by to come back before the voters; and possibly before a jury jury.
These are many 'ifs' and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps, or of which his European penalty is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state strike against Hitler if the West had just resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the Barbarai that followed.
The course of history is about such turnpoints and the unholdable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just faced with a number of such turnpoints.
What if Trump releases the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, that is, the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein arrived in the Devil's cuisine since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to record the president secretly and speculated that he was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein dementes the representation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordered FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements in the office?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a convention that forces Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, a long winter is ahead of us.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to inflammate Sabbath candles on the table with the crucifix.

Graham Dorrans by the Rangers optimistically before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that after the impressive remnant against Villareal in Spain, a victory against the Austrians will move them into a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for greater.
"This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We have gone to the game with our conviction that we can do something about it and we have rided a point home.
Perhaps we could have won at the end, but in total, a distinct was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another large European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a heavy game, since they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult with all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants of the survey knew exactly how to care for them, only a few talked about it with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the study of Nationwide reported to talk to your mates about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent claimed to talk to their children about it.
“The people want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation”, says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Party.
You should start with this.
Talk to your mate and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how you want to be cared, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial consultant on board: Your consultant can also help you find an opportunity to finance these expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care may include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-building life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Work on your legal documents: Avoid disputes in the last minute.
Instruct a precautionary authority, so that you order a familiar person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a power for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who takes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine intake or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that came to the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities. The number of dead should still rise.
Because of the failure of communication systems, helpers were not able to obtain information from the Donggala government district, a region north of Palu, close to the epicenter of the earthquake with the strength of 7,5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central-Sulawesi and is located at the end of a smal bay on the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district that stretches over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in the northwestern Sulawesi island.
In the government district, a administrative unit below the province, 2,99,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue from the economy Central Sulawesis, in particular the coastal region Donggala.
The nickel debau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
According to Indonesia, Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West-Donggala was hit in 1996 by a tsunami with nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami that met 14 countries and 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes shocked the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands outside the Coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with strength 6.8 shaken the southern Javas, Indonesia's most populating island and launched a tsunami that met on the south coast and demanded nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with strength 7.6 met the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed thousands of villages and demanded about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shocked the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died by disturbing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes met the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists, and demanded more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily strangered on the island.
Sarah Palin’s son arrested for complaints of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and former candidates for the Vice-President's office, was arrested due to accusations of body injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested because of the suspicion of domestic violence, the disabling of domestic violence and resistance to state violence, such a report published by the Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off a friend's phone when they wanted to communicate the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is investigated in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 has been charged.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked for his plea with "Not guilty, absolutely sure", the network said.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A infringements, which can be enforced by up to one year prison and a penalty of up to USD 250,000.
He is also charged with a disorder of Class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time that Palin has been charged with penalties.
In December 2017 he was convicted to have attacked his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the claimed attack.
The case is currently negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, disabilities for the reporting of a crime and arms possession under the influenza of infiltration in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend pretended to beat her in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she caused her son's behavior to a posttraumatic burden disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami by earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a earthquake that shocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and it is expected that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just before the coast of Central Sulawesis, located north-east of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On the social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami met on the coast.
Federal lawyer demands rare death penalty for suspects in New York terrorist attack
The federal lawyer in New York calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the accused in the terrorist attack of New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare penalty that has not been committed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terror attack, while in October he rushed on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and traveled footboys and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and “consciously” serious injuries of the body, says the deliberate declaration for the claim of the death penalty submitted in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation court of Saipov lodged a prosecution in 22 points covering eight accusations of murder against the background of organised crime, which are usually used by state prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as a accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The proposal requires "based planning and purpose", says the prosecutors who carried out the nature in which Saipov acted as "absurd, cruel and corrupted".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco injuries, pain and losses,” explains.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to a lifelong freedom penalty in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York during a federal crime, in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been blamed for the conspiracy two years earlier to commit spionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, was born in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, so court documents.
He announced before scientists that he was feeling good with what he did, says the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was inspired to do this after he had watched videos from ISIS on his phone, says the prosecution.
He also called on the police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the government defenders representing Saipov, stated that she was “self disappointed” due to the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a debt confession in exchange for a lifelong freedom penalty without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma that will suffer all the stakeholders," says Patton.
Saipov's Defense Team had previously asked the charge not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise the power of the people today during a protest action under the tories conference.
The former party head of Ukip stated that politicians must “feeling the pressure” of European shippers while a member of Theresa May's party suggested that dangers should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative back banker Peter Bone declared to the demonstrator in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be “prepared outside” if Farage Brexit ministers were.
The challenge faced by May in the reconciliation of its deeply disputed parties was strengthened by participating in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems with maintaining her compromise plan Chequers despite the attacks of the Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Alliances insisted that, despite the reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and therefore force Euro-Scheptikers and the oppositional Labour Party to decide between their package and the Chaos.
Bone explained on the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers belong to the waste’.
He proposed that a peer should have been named and that he should have been responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was responsible, we'd be out already," he explained.
The member of Wellingborough added: 'I will admit to the Brexit, but Chequers belong to the waste.'
His opposition to the EU, he stressed, ‘We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that since the referendum in 2016, the public opinion has changed: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
The Brexit advocate of Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and explained reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we are chosen.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a top message to May, she continued: ‘President keeps her jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must ‘feel pressure’, they should just be involved in deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of confidence between us, the people, and our political class’, so farage.
‘They are trying to deceive the Brexit, and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘You do not come from it.’
Before an enthusiastic quantity, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilise the power of the people of this country that helped us to victory in the referendum and will never rest until we are no independent, self-management, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour advertising in the city center.
A few activists turned Banner of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was funny about the Tories who had security problems with a party app at the opening of the conference.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, Adonis says.
'This is a farce.
There's just no good Brexit', he added.
Warren intends to ‘examined’ the presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would "examined the candidate of the presidency".
The Boston Globe reports that the democratic from Massachusetts spoke of her future on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts.
Warren, an outstanding critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-electing the Senate against the Republican Members in the House of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice Chairman of Trump's Champ in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was the focus of speculations that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall-Format since Trumps official access.
One of the present people asked her if you would like to candidate for the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested by Friday in the case of deadly shots on LSU Basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to arrest the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at the Eastern Time.
On Friday, they had published a video of shooting and asked for help in identifying the man to see on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of the Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot injury at the head and died as a result of this injury,” explained the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247 sports by the police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to be a weapon at the crime scene and possession and to have shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any further incidents and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two meters of Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start shows in the last season and could have an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great Prize of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after his team has given him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed on Saturday in the Qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that the stall order of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited vettle to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton be in traffic at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind Vettel, but after a button cycling-an-rad-manöver, where the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside to endure with the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the backs of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then for a large part of the race the fastest, as he held on his tyre to close quickly and get Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while raikans ended as fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri gave the whole weekend an excellent performance and how a real gentleman acted when he was supposed to leave me.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A Case of Truly Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump was funny on Saturday at an electoral event about Senator Dianne Feinstein, who persisted in not sending the letter by Christine Blasey Ford to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address the statement before the Senate's Legal Committee, but commented that the actions in the Senate showed that people are “common, malicious and dishonest”.
“One thing that could happen and the miraculous thing that has occurred in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are wrathful and malicious and malicious and dishonest”, says the President.
“ When you look at the leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Published the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't published it."
Okay, please.
If we have... no, we haven't published it," he added by following the voice of the senator.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July, and he was published in early September. However, Finstein disputes that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s charges, I have not published your story,” explained Feinstein to the Committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request after secret."
Their dementi seemed to be uncomfortable with the President, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continual defence of the Judge candidate, who is accused of sexual abuse by three women, the Democrats claimed that they would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power with all means.
You see the commonness, the wickedness, they don't care for who they hurt when they are hit under the wheels to maintain power and control," said the President, mediaite.

Patrick Dwyer reached two gates for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did the defeat again on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 victory in the replay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led early with two gates, after meetings by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was like Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two gates.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, the Dundee struck in Belfast on Friday evening 2-1, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, where the Giant won the three previous parties.
Dwyer's opening store took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation of Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the proposal when Beauvillier expanded the leadership.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie moved to his compensator after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the leadership of Giants before the half-time break when he reached his second gate of evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team was regrouping and Bouchard was like a power player in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the party late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth gate after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home on the next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Flyers died after he was sure that hundreds of people escaped from earthquake in a plane
A pilot in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to allow a plane with hundreds of people on board to start safely.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shocked on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong afterquakes are still to be felt in the region and many people are captured under drums in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save your lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agencing refused to leave his posts in the strongly swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that the flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was on the startway at the time, was safely lifted.
He then ran out of the Tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agitation died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, speaker of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australias ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousands. The country's disaster protection authority declared that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise since many bodies are still under the drums, while others cannot be achieved”, says the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority’s speaker.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance with the dead comes.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy now, but it could get much worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, in a talk before the military of the country, said: “I ask you to work all day and night to perform all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shocked by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports now of a missing person after a plane crash in Lagune
The airline that run the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now reports of a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew had been evacuated safely from the falling plane.
Air Niugini explained in a communication that they cannot say anything about the remaining of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The Airline claimed to cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The Airline did not reply immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save other passengers and crew members after the plane was crashed into the water when trying to land on the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officers claimed that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline argued that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact expiry of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in the Lagoon shortly before the railway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying out of the railway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane approached very smoothly.
"This is a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wave through hip-depth water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight companions were screaming and screaming and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy argued that navys working close to the improvement of an installation site hurried with a blowable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The Aviation Security Network data can be found that 111 people died in crashes from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them concern Air Niugini.
Analysis reconstructs the end of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation ended her proof in the reconciliation of a case in which a man was convicted to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analytist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett declared for hours as an expert in information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers victim at their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was together with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, says the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford entered the Witness stand on Saturday and said that he had not been in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied, "as my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known two weeks at their death time.
But mobile records showed that they knew themselves for a week.
Rowlett explained that a while after Chamber's death, Tellis released their news, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He put them out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to start their plea on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is then before the jury this day.

Another black?!
New York's child girl accuses couple for a release after “racist” SMS
A New York child girl complains a couple because of a discriminatory release after receiving a misdirected message from the mother in which they complained that she was “another black”.
The couple argued to be racist and compared the dispute with a “expression”.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her disturbance when she found out that the new daily mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she took her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEIN, NO WHARSE,” wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending them to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognising her Fauxpas, the "pity-pityed" Plasco-Flaxman Maurice released and claimed that the open African daymother had done bad work and instead expected a Philippines, says the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice declares the couple of compensation for dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the $350 per day, which they would have claimed over six months, for which the job for which they had been booked originally, but without a contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that," she explained the newspaper on Friday, "I know that it is discrimination."
The couple rejected the racism allegations and argued that the discharge of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had offended them, to no longer be able to trust them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco of the post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was unpleasant to them even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the trial with a “expression” and explained that his wife expects a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation”.
“You want such a person to have interests?
This is not very nice," added the investment banks.
While the dispute continues, the couple in the public was quickly condemned and appealed to the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of Michael Bond, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put into someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
Today it's very funny with our modern knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it, had been rejected his work and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was "bittersüß" after his death in the last year.
She explained that your father was in secret proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as a “very important family member”.
"He was a very silent man and didn't cry," said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you are proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he invented and created him, he always gave Paddington the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter in Nice was brought to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where the doctors tried to save their lives in vain.
“Nad regularly called to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that she gave to her doctors to keep her heart pumping sounded slowly and left her body.
She died just before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I could not cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to crack."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now sad about the loss of her daughter, went on board of the plane along with the other passengers who did not get any of the things she was through.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over the wings all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women hang on cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family by suicide strive to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales Cards with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for advisory offices.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel as I feel every day, ” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smiles.
Everyone said that his smiles could light a room."
However, he announced his job before his death as he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014 Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“He did not say he felt depressed or depressed,” she explained.
“ A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at the depth. When the children packed out their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that had to go through it: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the swebe during the FBI starts with investigations
"I thought if we could actually get something that he asked for, i.e. a timely and limited investigation, then we might get a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday, and he fears that the Committee will break apart in the partial policy stop.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his republic supporters want the FBI's investigations?
Their contradiction can be reflected on the timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans, as expected, cut badly, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone hearer to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits his report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 democracies are currently sitting.
It is still uncertain whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide on equality and to confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean survivors ‘sink’ under Kim
The number of North Korean surpassors to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-sug, who is called on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunion, explained that last year 1127 surlopers were registered, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices of human smugglers than main factors.
Pingung did not publicly comment on this.
The majority of the Northern survivors are eventually offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul argues that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most of them flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China considers the survivors rather than illegal immigrants as refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are still technically in the state of war, have improved significantly in the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State in Pjöngjang met on discussions that were about the denuclearisation negotiations.
As a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American penalties for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to be unilaterally disarmed first," says Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says that he is not suitable for the Office of the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Nancy Pelosi Representative House called Judge Kandidaten Brett Kavanaugh “hysterically” and said that he was characterically unqualified for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted like this had been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented emotionally all the accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he screamed almost and stood in tears shortly before when he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the democratics in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "large and coordinated call murder" organised by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believes that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she shows that he was preoccupied with democracies.
“I think he has even declared himself unfair with these statements and the way he went over the Clintons and the Democrats,” she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to terminate Kavanaugh of the Office, he should be confirmed and the democratics should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only inappropriate to the Supreme Court but also to his present judges," says Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued that as a democratic she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or the fundamental decision on abortion, Roe v. Wade, as he is assessed as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would review certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, predominant person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Ach is not wonderful’,” says Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere speech of hatred, months and years of overcooking anger and she does not get it out without crying.
“We are crying when we get angry,” said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also wept when she becomes angry, but developed a technique. If she becomes angry and begins to cry, she says to the person to whom she said: “You might think that it is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then they just keep talking.
I thought this was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is a former job, in a office dominated by men, where I was crying one day because of an incredible anger and by an elderly woman, a chilled manager, for whom I was always a little scared, packed at the trap and moved into a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"You don't know you're stinky.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you have gone into the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congress Officer from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidates.
In 1987, when Hart was taken on a ship named Monkey Business at an unmarried affair and then withdrawn his candidate, the deepest frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidate.
“This was not a well-considered decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation: ‘Sneewitch and the seven dwarfs’.
Since the electoral campaign had already advanced, it was at the back of the funding and she sweared not to announce if she had not to get two million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported their campaign with $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced no official campaign to start, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, appreciability for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the purchase of funds and direct addressing of the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger of sexism, so that she was close to tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the pocket cleaner Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my grave stone.
"She wept?"
Why Peking could benefit from trade war between the United States and China
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was ear deaf. Although the battle is not over for a long time, Peking could benefit from a long-term grave between the countries, my experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he proved important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penalties.
The most important escalation took place this week with new punishment duties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Each time Beijing smote back in the same way and raised a recent punishment duty of five to ten percent on American goods at a value of $60 billion.
China sweared to answer any US action and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon be stumbling.
To move Washington to the introduction would mean to give up. However, public knocking to the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that when Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the Commercial War on the long term by reducing mutual dependency of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in either Washington or Beijing in both countries is actually far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia in the thinking factory Center for New American Security.

It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so unendingly happy to recover the pokal.
It is about the team and I am happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.

There was a time this morning when we had put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Shut up for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players gave a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
