Stars give off light and heat as a result of the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are combined (or spread) together to form heavyer elements.
Scientists are working to build nuclear fuels that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it will take many years before we see the useful collapse ovens.
The steel needle rushs down to the water because of a surface pen.
Surface sprays occur, so water molecules at the water surface attract to each other more than air molecules above them.
The water molecules form invisible skin on the surface of the water, making things like the needle allows to flow down on the water.

This is done by sending small lights called “lights”.
Scientists call this the process of stimulating emission of radiation because cells are stimulated by bright light, which causes the emission of light and light is the type of radiation.
The next picture shows the atoms that send light devices. Of course, light units are actually much less than those on the picture.
Light ends are even smaller than the material that forms atoms!
After use in hundreds of hours, the luminosity thread of the light pepper is burning up and the light pear no longer works.
Then we need to change the pear, and we need to be careful when switching the pear.

The abnormality of the attractive lens is that the scorpion level and the number of lens factors needed to achieve the number of burning elements is much greater than for the cell lens.
This is going to be less important, as lens manufacturers produce better results in the production.
This has enabled the attraction lens to produce images of comparable quality and obtained with lenses with a fixed burning width.
Another disadvantage to the attraction lens is that the light-up (speed) of the lens is usually less.
