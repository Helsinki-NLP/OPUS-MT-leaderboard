Politicians in Wales fear to "like fools"
There was horror among some members of the National Assembly of Wales on a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This has arisen because of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament (Walise Parliament).
AMs from the whole political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could give rise to ridiculation.
A member of the Labour party said his group was worried because "the rims on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open" to the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fjols).
In this context, the Walisian letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently composing a legislative proposal for the introduction of the name amendments, said: "Of course, the final decision on the names which Members of this Parliament will receive is up to the Members themselves."
The Government of the Act of Wales 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, where there was widespread support to call the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of the AMs, the Commission preferred the members of the Welsh Parliament (Walise Members) or the WMPs, but the MWP was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to propose alternative options, but the struggle to achieve agreement can prove difficult to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, which is expected to compile a legislative proposal on changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal on the reforms includes other changes in the manner in which the Assembly works, including rules on the discrimination of AMs and the composition of the Committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on what they should be called when the legislative proposal is being debated.
Macedonian votes on the change of the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The vote will be held in an attempt to resolve a decade of conflict with the neighbouring country Greece, which has their own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that their northern neighbour's name is a requirement for Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will disappoint the vote.
Deputy members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's will be quiet while the churches of Harlem fight
"The older people I've spoken with said that there was an old bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"Folk people are socialising in other ways now in days," he said.
"Bars no longer form the daily rooms of the neighborhood, where people go on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money collected on selling assets is not long and that they are "previously or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexs that are full of such people that do not help the recurrent places of the district.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy possessions in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further to the development where these churches finally close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who was at the top of a boycot of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not employ or promote black.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s covenants planned to restore the building, they ordered the watch game.
The priest David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the watch game "The Clocks of the Poor."
The expert, who played at the watch game in June, called it something else: "A cultural tax" and "a unreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first watch game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the bigger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them collected by church leaders, others of the Bishop.
In July, the Council of the Congregation – the headquarters of the Congregation, consisting of leading doctors – wrote to the Bishop of Anxiety that the Bishop "will try to push the expenses forward" to the Congregation Council, although the Council of the congregation had not been involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency from the Bishop’s side.
Hair damages 13-year-old on diving trips by hummers in California
A shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he ducked for hummers in California on the first day of the hummer season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had ducked with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group padded over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says he thought it was just enthusiasm to have caught a hummer, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was bite!
I was biten!"
He said, "Health his leg was ripped," and he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flyed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical state.
It's unwise what kind of shark that attacks.
Liver Savior Larry Giles said at a media letter that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic damage on his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the line from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to carry out investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most people do not consider dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to take up the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes up competition with Boots, Super Drugs and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with storms.
As part of a great effort to take up the British beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and living products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as the supermarkets are looking for new goods for shelves used earlier for television, microwave and housing products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products for 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing sortiments from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with burned areas like those you see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relancers the range of Boutique-makeup, so most of the products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the parfume store Fragrance Shop is testing in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the south of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a development against purchasing small amounts of food daily in local merchants means that supermarkets need to do more to make people visit them.
Mike Coupe, Director of Sainsbury's, has said that shops will look like storm gases, as the supermarket chain starts the fight with the discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales places since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily products and have made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempts of the supermarket to update beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint measure with Boots in the early 00s, but cooperation ended with a dispute about how the pharmacies' earnings in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes, after Sainsbury's, their pharmaceutical chain sold with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a further range of luxury care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and decoration of our series of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, which will be available to provide advice.
Our selection of fires is designed to meet all needs and the intaking environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "rashed," after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "rashed," after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle fire to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their living product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This morning host, 37, went to Instagram to advertise that she leaves the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones wrathfully after she withdraws from their lucrative lifestyle fire for the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "assuring," when the popular TV woman during an excited meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – meant that she had no longer enough time for their living product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to advertise that she left Truly, while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priority.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with in the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
There is a warehouse full of goods in the Marlow headquarters, which is already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the release from this Morning host, which is among British stars with the highest earnings, can cost the company several millions because of large investments in products – from puds to stearin light to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and the householder Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the Chairman of the Board in March.
The two pairs take on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is supposed to be a M&S fire ambassadors and replace Ant McPartlin as a host at ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business measures."
Hard talk, "and then we became in love"
He laughed with the criticism he would receive from the news media to give a comment that is "not a President worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his parody on a news host.
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in a more meeting after Trump exclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been closed.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "similar reaction" from the United States in relation to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that instead the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speech at his choosing meeting.
"Northern Korea's really good," he said.
"There were arrivals for war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have an amazing relationship."
He said that his attempts to improve the relationship with Kim had resulted in positive results – the completion of missile tests, help with the release of hostages and the return of earthly remains from U.S. military men.
And he defended his unusual approach in relation to Kim.
"It's so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside, trying to get into this close-packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes destroy the island and kill hundreds
For example, in the afterplay of the Lombok earthquake, non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboks population were homeless, national disaster state was not declared, which is a prerequisite for the call for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While the Save the Children composes a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, President of the National Disaster Preparation, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency effort.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly experiencing, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
There have been built tsunami refugees in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but a tsunamisir seems to be missing, and it probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s lack of infrastructure a central point in his campaign of elections, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
However, Mr Joko's administration has been disturbed by lack of funding in the course of the election campaign next year.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machites, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge compensates for the last moment against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea target, while his team was backwards with 1-0.
He stitched to the ball with his left foot before he made a high shot against the remote bar.
The ball flooded high over the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting into the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kantte came, and I made a single touch, and I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the half-player, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25 minutes.
The Chelsea attacker delivered with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he set his speed on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the middle track.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended against the remote pole with a shot with the left foot by Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the Champions League group game at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe League at Thursday 15 in London.
Death from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami has increased to 832, reports its disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many were reported to be caught in the walls of buildings falling down after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, told the speaker Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by wallbrokes from crashed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorandum of discussion on "rewritten history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts that were performed by his fanatic, puritan consequences.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "wrongness" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in connection with the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace at Westminster would be a goal.
The imagestorm during the British Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a evidence of attitudes in the 19th century and part of the history of a figure, which many still believe it is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defendant of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate image is subject to continuous historical debate.
What is absolutely certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognized figure representing one side of the battle.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth greeting and remembering."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man who is only identified under his surname "Yuan" was found dead with an overwhelmed pulse year and ensmured in blood near a pig pad on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pig injections with vaccines by a pig use on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province of China.
He said he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigs was open next to it.
He said there was a big eagles of blood in his mouth in the pig pad.
A judicial investigation confirmed that, according to the report, the pig of 250 kg had biten the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and injured," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan went to the market at 4.40 Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
One market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it attacking others while the police collect evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg had a whale farmer against his tractor, to his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can function as a "trigger".
"They're just medical.
They're very curious, they're not going to hurt you.
You just need to treat them with respect," he said.
The remains of the orcan Rosa are expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwestern United States
As foreseen, the orcan Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give strong rain of floods in northern Mexico and southwestern America over the coming days.
Rosa had winning 38 m/s, a category 1-orcan at 10 p.m. (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure exit is being created over the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the peninsula Baja California as a tropical storm, it starts pushing tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure exiter that comes closer and will create strong rain in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm rain will create dangerous storm floods, floating fall and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
The tropical moisture will produce rain with up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be up to 51 to 101 mm rain in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There is a great probability of storm floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move into the desert to foot when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can convert gaps to wave rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust bleeding.</seg>
The low pressure runner, nearby, will give powerful rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm which can cause less amounts of fluid downfall and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region during their raintime.
Spreaded tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and continues Wednesday.
In October there may be great temperatures in the United States, as the Arctic becomes cooler, but the tropicals remain fairly warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the Central United States Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.</seg>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a great probability of temperatures above the average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million saw Thursday's tangible witness statements from the nominated to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six TV stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations that interrupted the ordinary programmes to tell about Friday's late development: an agreement composed by Senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to do a week long investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate's judge committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunken state grazed on her and tried to take her clothes off to a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a emotional witness statement that he's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw that Friday.
The company listed average serial figures on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available views from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with measuring how many people see programs in offices.
In order to put it in perspective, it is a viewer number that corresponds to a match during the NFL playoffs or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts have strongly backed up on the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted the whole day, said Nielsen.
ABC was on the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interests remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of Friday's drama.
After the moderate republic's office issued an explanation that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning, while demonstrators cried at him when he tried to take an elevator to the hearing of the Judge Committee.
He stood with a downward look for minutes, while he was scolded out, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing in the committee.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judging Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go forward to a vote for the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he would only vote in favour of the conviction that the FBI would examine the accusations against the nominated in the next week, which the Democrats, who were in dispute in the Senate, had asked.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake took his decision.
Flake's choices were influenced because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister accuses critics of "play politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview next to Theresa May on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson presented her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect each other's tariffs was "awfully ridiculous".
Shoot killing at Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson, suspected to stand behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect for the shot murder at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of unreasonable murder, the police in Baton Rouge declared.
Officials released video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, the CBS daughter company reported WAFB.
After the interrogation of Simpson, the police said he confessed the shot killing on Wayde.
His warranty is set to $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, which stated that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports leader at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area of their "residency and chasing for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per battle last season.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach at LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "knut" and "in shock" over Waydes' death.
"It's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ashes over Mexico City
Ash, sprayed from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The national centre for the prevention of disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rooms and shocks over several rounds.
Images of social media showed thin layers of ash on car routes in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, since a earthquake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, shaking the Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police meet with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters wishing independence, collaborated with innocent officers as thousands of people participated in rivalising demonstrations that marked the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on release.
A group of masked separatists kept alarm officers back, washed with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds in streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Fights also occurred later on the day, where the police used their sticks to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independent groups cried "Not forgotten, nothing forgiven" and met Unionist protesters who cried "Long Life Spain".
14 people were treated for less damage caused by protests, reported the local press.
The vote remains high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegal from Madrid but celebrated by separatist catalysts.
The voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the choosing connection was low and those who were opposed to the loose relief were largely bowling the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year, after the police tried to stop the vote during violent conflicts at voting places throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer would hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"The last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy about having the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they had a narrow, but important, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan Independence Parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best known leaders have either moved into exile or sitting in detency and are waiting for their role in voting and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on his phone to support the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There'll be bigger and more tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have awaited his trial since last year, reported that he would take up the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The setting up as a candidate for European elections is the best way to refrain from the backwards of the democratic values and the undercutting that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, after house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car once again encountered a house in Londonderry.
The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday at 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage on the gates and the building itself.
It may also be that a arm breast was fired against the car at a time.
Shoot from Menga gives Livingston victory at 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The excavators Livingston overwhelmed Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Mengas shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved side by side with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out in the liga in this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they are eight points after, next Sunday.
Before then, Ranger will be visited by Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, builds up their unseated line for six fights, and Chief Coach Holt has still not had a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash endurance
Holt's team should have been ahead long before, they scored, and their direct game style created great problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across in front of the target, then Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he grew in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-head before the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could give outstanding problems in deathball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important objective came.
Rangers made a frispark, and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the lay together to Menga, which made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but struggled to get through the defence of the home team, and the targeter Liam Kelly was mostly not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was defended with the feet of Rangers targeter Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livingston's deathball situations.
There were continuous deliverys in Livingston's field, but were defended, and two requirements for a penal park – after Halkett's dealing with the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal efforts and strong results for Livingston.
Everyone played amazing and exceeds the expectations of their upward journey.
Their game style and troops are mostly unchanged since their return to the best liga, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he came to.
There were many heroes.
Commander Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defense, and Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes throughout the game.
Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their conclusions lacked sharpness – only once they got the only home team – and it is a great wake for Rangers, which is in the middle of the pointtablet.
The Erdogan receives mixed receipt in Köln
There were smiles and blue skys on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreements between areas such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's approach to the European Union.
The Erdogan then went to Köln to open a new, big mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police held a mass of 25,000 from gathering before the mosque, but a lot of supports appeared in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept it.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest, which is seen as a hero of some German Turks and mocked as an autocracy of others.
Unfortunately on the way in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred close to the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers in the place, but the man died in the place.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled from the place, at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday’s accident.
Metropolitan Police said police were working on identifying the man and informing his relatives.
There are set up road barriers, bus routes have been converted and motorists are invited to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six officers injured during anxiety
Six prison officers are injured in trouble in a high-security prison according to the Prison Office.
There was anxiety in the prison HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9.30 BST Sunday, and the disturbances are still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been picked up to handle the revolts that involve eight prisoners and are in one fly of the prison.
The officers were treated for smaller facial injuries in the place.
A spokesman of Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are committed to dealing with the current disturbances of HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clarified that the responsible people are reported to the police and can end up spending longer behind traps."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, alarm officers were called to prison to deal with serious disturbances, where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a storm flood (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure affects Arizona, but it is most likely at the beginning of next week when the remains of the orcan Rosa move over the desert landscape in the southwestern United States and pose a risk of storm flood.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about a storm flood for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "10 tropical cyclones had preserved status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center foresee 51 to 102 mm rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will probably receive 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For them outside the risk of storm flood, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region has been affected by drought.
Overflowing is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the rain will be useful because the southwest USA is currently experiencing dryness.</seg>
According to U.S. drying surveillance, just over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme dryness, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, orcan Rosa is expected to hit land on Baja California, Mexico.</seg>
Rosa still has a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain of parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total rainfall of 76 to 152 mm is expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border to Arizona early in the morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and the United States' southwest desert area," reported National Hurricane Center.
Rain is expected to create life - threatening storms and flowing fall in deserts and earthquakes in mountain terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of murder attempts after a 16-year-old was found with stick in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, declaring the police in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on everyone who has to have mobile recordings of events to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was understood by the 'wrongness and anger' of the democratic party.
"A voice of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the unreasonable and unclean tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a Wheeling election meeting in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been subjected to "the evil, the anger" of the democratic party through the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness statement before the convention Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed sexually to her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave witnesses at the hearing of his accusations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skilled legal brains in our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of republic meetings at the voting places at the mid-term elections.
"In five weeks is one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me," he said.
That's why I'm going around and fighting for fantastic candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block".
The first important procedure vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person high placed in the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the death rate grows
At least 384 were killed, and many of them washed away by huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a great tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi, stated on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were assembled for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] of high waves hit the coast at thundertime, sucked many in death, and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami emerged after a earthquake that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunamith threat emerged yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach, not running immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia's disaster preparation for GBP, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, the cars, tree tribes, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More survived by climbing up in trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16.700 were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The catastrophe tool has published air photographs that show many ruined buildings and shops, distorted and crashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afternoons continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be seen in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board of Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy that was triggered during the large earthquakes of Friday was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bug, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were crashed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the walls from crashed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged, and 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that the death rate and damage could be greater along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the area of Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely lame without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300,000 people here," said the Red Cross in a release and added that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The Board was criticized from many fronts on Saturday, not to tell that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had arrived within the period of the warning was sent.
In amateur recordings divided into social media, one can hear a man at the upper floor of a building who desperately calls warnings about the tsuami that comes closer to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not confirm the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a great deficiency of electricity that dismisses the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has started sending freight flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a strong need for food and basic needs among the evacuated.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for assistance work and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death rate after Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions staff from Donggala have come safely to Palu City, where employees are looking for shelter under posts set up in the farm at their account. They passed areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me they were so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when auxiliary organisations began the hard work of relocating the assistance work, it complained that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad must only enter if the area where the accident has occurred is declared national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says "Okay, it's a national disaster", we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the other night in Palu after Friday's earthquakes and tsunami, friends and families held to the missing people in the hope that their closer will be the miracles that light the dark story about natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a wash.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been caught under walls for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which had ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other of those caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As a veteran in paragliding I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how he in the hours, after the news of the crash of Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, desperately had sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages resulted in only one cry flube instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Thieves take 26.750 USD while filling the money machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole 26,750 USD from a Brink's employee who was about to fulfill a money machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car driver had cleared the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up the back of the Brink's staff" and stole a bag money that should have been delivered.
According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the site, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the event.
All with information about the identity of the thiefs, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes its name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West switches name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the surname Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change occurs before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces songs Ariana Grande at the show, which declared for "sensitive reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most commonly used words in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier in the year, discussing his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who've changed their names.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he reported that the names Love and Brother Love prefer.
One of West's former cooperatives, JAY-Z, has also switched between lower and upper case letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country is nearing the 50's for a bloody retaliation action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops shot against a peaceful demonstration at the place on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements hit root many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities bring young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use in research in the field, says investor and AI users Kai-Fu Lee, who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the U.S. government have issued statements on artificial intelligence, but the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aimed at taking the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in the AI," said Lee.
Double budget could double the chances that the next great performance in artificial intelligence is achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranged American Othello player, and later he became the leader of Microsoft Research and director of Google department in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionary could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to achieve government legacies, says Lee.
"It's not China that grabs the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed astronomers from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China's State Council issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation delivers funding to people on academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and the distribution of money from other government organisations to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the United States Defence Ministry established a common centre for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the Foundation of Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation attempting to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence has remained silent for several months.
Macedonian votes on the change of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, an action that would solve a decade of old conflict with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempts to achieve membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement for Greek territory and has therefore used their vetor when Macedonia has sought to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primary slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not take part in the vote, and a boycot campaign has made doubts about whether the chooser volume will be the 50 % required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the voting note was, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Followers of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is worth paying for access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that occurred as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's paraply, because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will observe and apply the vote result.
The amendment would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported at 13 p.m.
However, the elections were only 16% compared with 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66% of the registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Before the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and took chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boykotte the vote.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to gain membership with travelled pans, not at the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would provide a strongly demanded investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think that a large majority will vote in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after voting.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "security of our future".
A review published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research suggested that between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the vote – less than the election participation required.
Another opinion measurement carried out by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order to make the vote valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the provestal government since it entered into May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights throughout the Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0-winning Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his score coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a submission on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran quickly by three Brighton defenders before he swooped out on an open track.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green traws.
He fought past one defender, and then ran from more on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to list the Brighton target Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero fights with some problems with the feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola reporters.
"We talked about playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate predicament in the Premier League fight.
That target came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in that sequence the ball deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a great delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before he brought Sterling to the remote bar.
Sky Blues forward stitched the ball in the net just before it glittered over target.

Scherzer wants to kill Rockies.
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take in the castu Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participating in playoffs for Rockies, who has played a match more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least held in a wild card place with a 5-2 victory over the National Friday evening, but still have their first division title for good.
"Though we don't have anything to play for, we can go to the fight well know that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audiences here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the highest level that I'm going to face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those circumstances?"
Nationals has not yet issued the startup for Sunday, but will probably set Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who wanted to be the first man on the plate for the 34th time, trained his throws Tuesday and wanted to pitche on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.

Trump holds a chooser meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in relation to his elections to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of republics meetings at the votes at the midst of the elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big ones – you can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me. That's why I'm going around and fighting for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats that you can see it happens right now.
And they are determined to get power back with all the available means. You can see how evil, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they're going over to get power and control; that's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
The democratics, he said, have as a mission "fighting and blocking."
"And you have seen it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "wrathful and evil and disgusting and lieful."
He referred to the highest democratic senator in the Senate's Senate Judging Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which triggered the audience's loud bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you finish the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spatial party.
They are intolerable to those who express their attitudes.
When momentum's activists in my local party voted about censurering me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am only the last one in a wide range of Members from Labour who have been told that we are not welcome – only because we have made our views known.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she took a strong distance from anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censur was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
As regards the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders in.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local parliamentary member, the meetings on Friday evening have just been like this.
Unfortunately, today the tone of many meetings is not the same, and the promise of "friendlyer, softer" policy lies far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed into whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It began shortly after that Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared political standing, began to expect that I would make an U turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was about national security or the internal market of the European Union.
When I say my opinion in the public – and I really don't care what I say – follows a long line of rough messages on the social media that calls for dismissal and opposition to the middle searching policy and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the willingness to fight from the colleagues, who are obscured by sexism or racism every day, but still fighting.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is where normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week Labour was to create a tolerant culture.
But, in fact, it is no longer a spatial organization and with every voting of distrust or change of selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice in the last two years about that if I lay down on myself and don't be so exciting, I'm gonna be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, who had left our classroom in disadvantaged state, and I sat down to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a city council member or minister of the government.
I've never hidden my policy, neither during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current management.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I would like to say that when the country turns forward to Brexit, who will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's leader.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats to choice or political suitability will prevent me from acting on the basis of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unset Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have made the final result to draw a not completely true image, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tentent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the pointtablet and are the only unwinning team of ten.
Finally, it was as much as their superior defense as their better exploitation of the chance that brought home the home team, and trainer Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our fights have been challenging so far, and we are still unwinning, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect to Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Andersons score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr ahead, but a yellow card to the Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, which was distributed to the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose a advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score which was not followed up by a kick.
Climo developed Ayr's leadership with a penal park just before the half-player. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the pause.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Andersons score, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the score difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had had a serious injury. He was brought out of the board on the bears. When the game was restarted, Ayr built the forespring with a score from Stafford McDowall and a subsequent spark from Climo.
Working Ayr leader Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card, and again, Melrose exploited their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the pillars and followed up with a more almost right after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent fly player Gregor Henry leaving to the homeway's fifth score.
Still Game Star looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry after it appeared that he has taken the directorial post of an authorised restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in along with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The Duo has announced that the next nineth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan plans a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on history, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's growing market for restaurants.
"Haven is ours": The country of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol around the fleet's headquarters, covered in rains, in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overwhelmed with the motto: "The port is ours, it's a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
Throughout the country of Bolivia, a coastal stretch that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still strong, and the same is the longing to sail again on the Pacific.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course waiting with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will give Bolivia part of the obligation that Chile – after decades of discussions – is to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over a area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president, who faces a controversial election fight next year, also has a lot of risk at the judgment of Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, analytists believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would not be major changes if it did.
The United Nations Assembly, which is seated in the Netherlands, has no power to overcome Chilean territory and has established that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court sentences only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a chilenian expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have returned.
"The case of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' warrior rhetoric has disappeared with the remaining Chilean favor, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at one time continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision taken by the Court was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a extraordinary opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "finish an era of 139 years with disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, which is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crochet.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says that no nuclear disarmament is coming unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never devastate their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with promises given at a summit in Singapore between the rivalising leaders.
His comments were given as far as the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to face a restart of the fixed nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "wish dream" to continue sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korean war will ever bring North Korea into the knee.
Washington is reluctant to the declaration as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the American President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism in relation to whether Pyongyang is serious in relation to eliminating a arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month as a preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear that you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun entirely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk blurred for a collection of strange headwear in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection was impressed at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unractical hats have dominated on Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their outstanding creatures down the catwalk.
The most impressed work from Valentino was an overwhelming with a featherlike wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including water melons with jewels and even ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had combined lips that reminded more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diver with snorkel and mask, and others looked like a melted waffle ice.
And if you continue the big mode statements, you're lucky.
Style scouts foresee that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The huge hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the strain hat with a 60 cm wide shadow that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the highest unpractical hat that was spread over social media has sent a new great creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw that is almost as large as the model showing it.
The orange bastard with bast fries and a white leather handle was the most obvious in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in general stores next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it is hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools of Scotland have many great academic results behind it, and it continues in 2018 with a number of extraordinary exam results, which are strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best service level to their students and parents.
The independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as global citizens.
As a educational sector, which can compile and implement a cutting pensum, we experience that modern languages remain a popular subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you'll hit that head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stay in English when we want to build relations and confidence among people from other countries.
We can consider the latest graduation results this year, that languages are the highest in statistics with most existing exams in independent schools.
Overall 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the high character A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received the grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences, which children and young people undoubtedly will need in the future.
Languages are now considered as subject choices at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school pensa and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills conducted in 2014 found that, among the reasons why employers could not occupy jobs, 17 % had to do with lack of language skills.
Consequently, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will in the future require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skills like this.
The possibility of communicating directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a pretext to competitors.
According to a YouGov measurement measurement with over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multiple percentage, 15 percent.
It is therefore important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When speaking more languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ from languages in which to be taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others are teaching in languages that are expected to be most important to Britain when looking forward to 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scotian independent schools are dedicated to delivering a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required for success, regardless of what the future offers.
At present it cannot be denied that languages continue to be truly important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this excellent to the youth of Scotland.
I want the bees to be fair.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron gets debut for Laker's Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first match for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James plays in Sunday's opening fight before season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's playing.
"It'll be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's" official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeteed that James is most likely not going to play the whole game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked for his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six fights before the season start.
"Where I am in my career I don't have to fight until the season starts to get ready," he said.
Trumps Chooser Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of choosing meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five scheduled election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the confirmation of Trump's appointed judges at the free seat of the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the coming mid-term elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when the votes are delivered in November.
When is Trump's chooser meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trumps chooser meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia will be held at midnight (Danish time) night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's chooser meeting in West Virginia online via livestream at YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, which is nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were stressed because of accusations of sexual offensive conduct, and the expected vote in the Senate of confirmation was suspended for a week while the FBI examines the accusations.
However, the primary objective of this line of elections is to create momentum for the Republicans faced with a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five election meetings next week are aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Reuters", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible, now that we enter into the busy campaign time," said a spokesman of the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening's pick-up meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state, he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind in the opinion measurements.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to pop up to give him a boost in the measurements," said Simon Haeder, who is engaged in state science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team United States has shown a fighting spirit and attempts to keep hope alive before Sunday single duals
After three unilateral rounds, Saturday's four-man duals might be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The vibrant momentum endowment is a completely invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it as a momentum," said Jordan Spieth, before he held fourteen.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are four points ahead and there are 12 points to play about.
However, as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can cry with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to green and set a good example for his teammates.
The high jubilee cry became higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put that guaranteed victory in duel four, even though he and Thomas had been two hits backwards after two duals.
His put, which secured them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar cry – the kind of cry that shows that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find out the inner strength and focus on your own fight," said Spieth.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the biggest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sympathetic couples have received four points in four fights, and appear to be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is them that it will be the most difficult to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is firmed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Anyway, synchronously on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning entirely in the four-man duals, when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two double bookeys on the first nine holes graved the Spanish and the Swedish down into a hole they were never near to get out of.
Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can quickly change.
Europe has played better as a team until now and has created a significant leadership before the last day, but the four-man customers have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit, which some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe creates leadership at 10-6 in advance of the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a leadership over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods and have until now received four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who is trying to win the pocal they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a inaccurate American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in foursomes, and they won four battles, but were still behind.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pokal.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have received the call "Melliwood" is after a sensational weekend only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history, who has won four points in their first four fights.
They broke Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a courageous Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two matches Saturday, had little brilliant glimpse, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning's fourballs and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes and got a 2-1-winning over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka – the number three in the world.
Europe, however, is quite as they want, on a lightly blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three-double major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans with two points Saturday.
They got a hard fight 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and later returned and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes, after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being back with four points before the single fights. However, as Furyks currently has the pocal, they only have to achieve indefinitely to keep it.
After being the second best for two days, however, they do not seem to be able to cope with a counter-attack Sunday.
North Korea says that they will not disrupt unilaterally if there is no trust.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust to the United States and that it will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the Worldwide Organization that North Korea had demonstrated "a significant well-being" in the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, developing an area for nuclear tests and laws not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have not, however, seen a similar response from the United States," he said.
"No confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no chance that we will take the first steps ourselves and devastate unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-separated" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps, but his speech seemed important, as the unilateral disarmament, which has otherwise been the case from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint release from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atom disarmament on the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has asked for a formal end of the Korean war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up their nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also demonstrated opposition to bleeding for scrapy international penalties against North Korea.
"USA insists on 'atom disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their objectives by force and even opposes the 'declaration of the end of war'," said Ri.
"The insight that sanctions can bring us into our knees is a dream among people who don't know who we are.
But the problem is that they continue to reinforce our distrust."
Ri did not mention any more plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader of the United Nations highlighted earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ri's speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that firing North Korea's missiles against the United States' mainland was inevitable, after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "rocketed man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened with "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he commended Kim for showing courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea devastates.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for these measures, but said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without mistake until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006 the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline during the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times in the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, while North Korea just a few hours after accused him of making "passtrible demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States took "corresponding steps".
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding steps", he demanded, were the security vows that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against a normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where you study all night staying up of large quantities of caffeine.
A scientist has shown that students at the best university in the world often do not know the first thing to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He received the idea of the course after having held a lecture about the effects of sleep deficiency on learning.
"When the show was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I get to know this first now when I'm at the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleeping habits can improve your academic and sporting performance and your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Director of University Health, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding that the students were in serious sleep shortage during the week.
The hourly course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, runshoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how your sports performance is affected by sleep shortage and how important good sleeping habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deficiency over a long period increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know that - just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler adds.
The pride that is taking a "allnighter" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students has led to a growing problem of sleep deficiency.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and sufficient sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because sleep deficiency makes the brain believe that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California, studying chemical and physical biology, last year helped Professor Czeisler to organise the course when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work to make it a general course at the whole university.
He hopes that the next will be that all diplomas will be offered a similar course before they continue their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to put an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can cause awareness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can move at the day's rhythm and make it harder to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Targets from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outdoor when Dolly Mengas target meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take to thank with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first victory in the outskirt since 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard it only second defeat in 18 matches as a trainer. So there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, which a uninspired Rangers team could not answer back to.
Rangers now smoke down to a sixth place, while Livingston crawls up on a third place after Hibernian with only the target score to difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, when line judgments had to be treated by Calum Spence after being hit in the head of a thrown object that seemed to come from the outdoor section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the setup that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by tonting past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, put with the same 11 who shattered a point of Hearts' leadership last week, and he would have rejoiced to see his sharp team exhausted opponents throughout the field.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the game when Mengas first delivery sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle tracker's attempts passed.
A freezer park in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence player Alan Lithgow kicked by the backer stake.
However, Rangers took control, but played more on hope than capabilities in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was at least not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson disregarded the Columbian's appeals for a penalty park, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed after a quarter's game.
Rangers only managed two shots on targets in the first half year, but former Rangers target Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headstone and Ovie Ejaria's tamme shot.
Although Livis opened in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deathball situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in target.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave pots when the flyer sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up the path from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the leadership in the final part of the battle, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with safe hand before Lithgow headed next to targets.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late punishment park after being dry with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the goat counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of detecting and measureing radioactivity, an invention that in the long term would lead to the device known as the goat counter.
The Geiger counter has become a solid part of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles of boundary scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a goat counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that radioactiveness in the minerals makes."
Evans, "Hey, stop, there's a lot in it!"
"Hes" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have filled 63.
But the invention that wears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defence to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defence to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine learns the immune defence to recognize cancer cells in treatment
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient and change them in the laboratory
They can then "see" the protein common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from patients and change them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein name HER2, as many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "make several forms of cancer to develop," including breast-, egg-, lung- and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach where immune cells are taken out of patients and "teacher" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Canye West held Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after its SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistent performance in the Saturday Night Live study, Kanye West was built off when he celebrated the US President, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would set up as a president candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again-Cast, he began on a thunder talk against the Democrats and maintained his support to Trump.
"I speak so often to white people who say, "Why do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
But if I was worried about racism, I'd longly have moved from the United States," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed with Brett Kavanaugh's witness statement in the Senate's Legal Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's assault charge.
Although the recordings were not shown, comic Chris Rock Wests uploaded the tirade on the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to postpone West by putting the recordings up.
West also complained to the audience about poor treatment backstages because of its head clothing.
"They mobbed me backstairs.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They mobbed me!
And they said I had fallen deeply," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how deep I've fallen?", and said that he would take his Superman cap on because it means that "you can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience bowed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, Variety informs with a comment from a person who was present: "There was a bumble in the study."
West had been booked as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, raper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by acting with the song in Love It, while he was dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who Tweete: "To one of the most courageous people: DO NOT TAKE TO LAAT YOU TAKE OF THE POPLE."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweete that West is just "as he is, and it's fine."
"But I don't choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "art"), who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we have, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he'd made a change in names to "the entity that is officially known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist who's changed his name, so he follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rap colleague Snoop Dogg has been called Snoop Lion, and the recently dead musical legend Prince changed its name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington langer out for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress is looking for the stereotypical macho hero and says that this kind of TV character means that young men often feel that they need to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he thinks there's been something wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie of 31, admitted that the problem is "a lot of mind" to him.
"Currently, it's my mind – where have we gone wrong in town with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have taught young men in their growing up?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine qualities.
He continued, "What is inherited, and what is given?
What do young men learn from television and streets, which makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that is one of our time's big questions – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said he's "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit is from November involved in a replay of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother who is a thief.
The actress recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best at the whole Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my coming family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, like Kit's character, Jon Snow, become in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies family landmark in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people in the country have been hit, says the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Most of the new cases were sexually transferred, which is a new trend.
Traditionally HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China because of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way has been reduced to something nearly zero, explains Chinese health authorities at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transferred HIV is an emergency problem in China's LGBT environment.
In 1997 homosexuality was legalised, but discrimination against LGBT persons is supposed to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men are married before or later because of their conservative values.
Many infectious cases are due to the lack of prevention in these conditions.
Since 2003, China's government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as a attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked data about republic senators and twisted against "hazardous lies" and "conspiration theories"
Member of the Representatives' House Maxine Waters denied in Saturday's accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information on three republic senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The democracy of Los Angeles claimed that the claims were from websites and supported from "the outer right wing".
"Looks, liars and more horrible lies," wrote Waters in a Twitter lookup.
The published information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers on the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was issued on Thursday on the Internet by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. This happened during a hearing in the Senate for sexual abuse against the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The delicious thing happened after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative support pages such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been submitted by Waters' people and then published information about a member of Water's staff, writes The Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie," continued Waters.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unfounded accusation is completely untrue and a direct lie."
Waters' release quickly received criticism online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she has not the right temper to be a Congress member.
If you are accused of something you haven't done, you must not be angry.
You can't be proud.
You must not question the objects of the prosecutor.
You have to keep your mind calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Kavanaugh, which was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take over Waters' place in the mid-term elections, also revealed his opinion on Twitter.
"Short, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official release, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and order powers concerning these fraudulent claims."
"We will make sure that the criminals are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English strikes again – underwhelming spy comedie with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the standard to look for a Brexit angle in all newer films with a British ice layer, and it also seems relevant for the latest action comedie in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will dry, sarcastic self-satire, of how graceful it is with us, be the new export option of the country?
At least, the incompetent Johnny English with the gummian view and the great eyes have received its permission to re-cover the crystals. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic discovery directed to places where the cinema visitors don't speak English.
He is of course the stupid secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife spot Mr. Bean and proper cliff of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international lush pants that left chaos in his refrigerator, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertising.
There are some good moments in this recent shot on the tribe of JE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite underwhelming and strangely excessive, especially now when more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offer convincing comics as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed to children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny English's crazy adventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumbled movies in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point for the film is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
An Internet hacker has infiltrate England's top secret spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field for terrifying the responsible agent – a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and fighting clear Prime Minister who already suffers a complete melting in political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisors inform her that each active spy has been revealed, she is forced to repeal somebody's pension.
And of course, it's the broken Johnny English, who is now school inspector at a high-class school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of rock education in spionage.
English is rushed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hardly tried previous right hand Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overenthusiastic but well-meining submarine captain – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was wasted on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service's absolutely unpleasant Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is stumbling close to being embarrassed by the charismatic and disgusting tech-milliardary Jason Volta – the game of Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky ecapads: dressed as servants they put fire to an excellent French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok, as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make themselves known to Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired off in the final sequence of the film, but how well-meaning and energyful it is, there is a sense of child removal over it.
Right medium-sized.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barsle with plans for four days of work week with unchanged wages for the British
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour is said to consider a radical plan, so that the English can have a four-day working week but pay for five.
The party is supposed to have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an extra holiday.
That would mean that the employees would have three days' weekend without going down to pay.
Sources say that the idea would be consistent with the economic objective of the Party to move the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a change economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that suits the party's access to change the economy to the benefit of workers and to the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea when the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the electoral campaign for the Parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not supported by the Labour Party unanimously.
A speaker of the Labour Party said, "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not considered in the party."
Labour's shadow finance minister John McDonnell spent last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to flee power back from "anonymous directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The Shadow Finance Minister's plans also doubt whether the current shareholders in water supply companies will get their money back, since a government with Labour at the top could "discount" them in the light of immoral actions.
He also confirmed the plans to have workers in corporate management and to set up including owner funds to distribute 10% of the share value of private enterprises to employees who are to receive up to 500 £ annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes about the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI investigation on accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has deferred the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week, and it raises the question whether the FBI's finding could make the Republican senators draw their support.
In an interview shown on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their position.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I entered the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came up – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was stealed, determined and uncompliant."
On the other hand, Graham’s voice seems to be embroidered in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and other things would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it strongly," added Graham with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
That happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it had to change anything."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is the host city for the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an even impressive goal; to end the world's poverty.
The Global Citizens Festival will receive for the seventh time tens of thousands of people at Central Park's large grass where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal that is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation that struggles to put an end to poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, low voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a telephone call or another meaningful action that can bring attention to the goal of bringing an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach the target?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" – that people feel that they make a difference by signing a signature collection on the Internet or making a Twitter lookup?
The Global Citizen notes that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million "actions" from their members to different objectives.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to set up binding objectives and political measures that correspond to more than $37 billion, which are expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 objectives and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up to over $10 billion, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world until now.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which has started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong people. They strive to "help children experience their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4.700 seconds from the Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with undernutrition can become a footnote in the history books," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that the government of England has now promised to improve the nutrition of mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the often asked questions of the website, which says, "What makes you think that we can put an end to extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: "It's going to be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we'll fall and make mistakes.
But as with civil rights movement and the movements against separation, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the actors of this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy sports, says the US Interior Minister
"If necessary," Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, even in the Middle East, reveals the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where they operate on invitation from the legal government – is a claim to extend the sale of their energy.
"I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he must have said.
And according to him there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"USA has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if it becomes necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organization which considers itself "the voice of the U.S. Energy Consumer".
He compared Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran and said that they are in the bottom and under the same.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel," he said while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These opinions come after the Trump administration aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is the most cheap choice for European consumers.
In order to achieve this, spokesmen of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump itself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin the "catch" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive North Stream 2 management, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
Kreml believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of disadvantaged competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier," said the Russian Minister for Energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the U.S. Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans is confronted with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed their participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem with a third party interfering with our energy supply," said the leader of BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "consideres strongly" to stand up to the presidential election in 2020," says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "considering strongly" to stand up to the presidential election after mid-term election, she said Saturday.
During a city council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering to set up.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will consider considering the presidential election."
Warren announced his opinion about President Donald Trump under the city council and said that he's "having the country in the wrong direction."
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been pronounced in his criticism of Trump and his supreme Board Kavanaugh.
On a second Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course, the FBI has to examine the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday opinion shows that the majority of Warren's own backland does not think that she should stand up in 2020.
According to a review by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of "probable" choosers in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidateship.
The measurement showed greater support to former governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible setup.
Other highly profiled democratic candidates, discussed in the context of the presidential election in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Associated Press writes that he will notify his final decision in January.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a election meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
Monday evening, he was arrested and accused of violence at home.
"What my own son is going through, after he has come home, makes me be able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other damages with which our soldiers return home," she told the audience to a Trump election meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder, and they go and think if there is respect for that, their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence at home against a woman, in order to prevent the notification of violence at home and to possess a gun in a drunk state, says Dan Bennet, a spokesman of the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. support resistance against new asylum laws
18 States and District of Columbia support a legal objection against a new American law refusing asylum to victims who escape banner violence or violence in their homes.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-dependent declaration in Washington to support an asylum applicant who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union issued in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons, who are gang members", had abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
The state prosecutors, who support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers came, as countries with widespread problems with bonds and violence at home.
The new US asylum legislation rejected a decision made by the US foreign agreement in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia's State Attorney, Karl Racine, stated on Friday that the new law "looks away from decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle is against that principle," says the party independent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants damages the US economy, since there is more likely that they will become independent and "supply necessary labour."
In June, Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions dismissed the right of immigration judges to give asylum to victims flying from domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or a political standing," said Sessions in its announcement of the Law on 11 June.
It has never been intended that asylum should remedy all the problems – or just all serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, the attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation became worse.
"It's very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little febrile boy at an evacuation centre in the broken town of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We're missing clean water."
The inhabitants now returned to their ruined homes to sort in bleeding possessions and to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were also affected by the earthquake of 7.5 could not follow.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and the shoulder, were outside the Palus military hospital, where patients are treated outdoors due to severe ecstasy.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room in the fifth room, he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There wasn't time to save ourselves.
I was mast up against a broken wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was going to marry in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of infinite methods and propaganda ads
One week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-page ad in an American newspaper that drumed for the benefits of an American-Chinese collaboration, the U.S. Ambassador in China in Beijing accused of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President, Donald Trump, referred to China Daily's paid inducement in Des Moines Register – Iowas's best selling newspaper – after accusing China of interfering with the 6th of November. China rejects the accusation.
U.S. officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese involvement in the US elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in a escalating trade war, where they have placed customs duties on each other's imports on several occasions.
China's repayment duty in the trade war was to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump, Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China, former governor for a year in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural food to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in a leader in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "takes up the use of the infinite methods by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press by driving a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the kiosques here in Beijing, however, you will only find disagreements, and you will not get a fair picture of the Chinese people's different attitudes to China's worrying economic direction, since the media are under tight control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "an of China's most prominent newspapers failed to publish" his article, although he didn't say what.
The Republicans alienate women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warns analytics
While many top-republics support and defend the High Court's nominated Board Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analytics warn that they will experience a counter-reaction in the next mid-term election, especially from women.
The matter has put the feelings into cook, and the majority of the Republicans have already published that the vote will continue.
"This can't be done again," Grant Reher, Professor of State Knowledge at Syracuse University Maxwell School, told The Hill in a article Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that the Republican Senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) request for a FBI investigation for 11 hours will milden the wrath voters.
"Womens do not forget what happened yesterday – they do not forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, who is a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group, according to The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, the demonstrants cried at a demonstration in the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Board of Justice chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement from Professor Christine Blasey Ford, it is said from Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach a new height," said independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"The people say that it has already reached a high level; that is right.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swivel choosers in the foretowns and younger choosers – 18-29-year-olds – which rarely vote, despite not to like the president."
Even before Ford's public charges on the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court of Justice, analytists had pointed out that if the Republicans continued to nominate, it could be a reluctant.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is responsible; it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," pointed Guy Cecil, chairman of the United States Priorities – a group that supports democratics in being chosen – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared attitudes to whom they should believe after the witness statements from Ford and Kavanaugh, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new opinion from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in the Ford’s witness statement, while 35% said that they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either likely or absolutely lieing under their witness statement, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI now examines the accusations submitted by Ford and at least another one, Deborah Ramirez writes for The Guardian.
Ford said last week under an oath to the Senate's Board of Justice that Kavanaugh took her in full when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Tribunal showed her his sex parts to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technologyist is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee was joking that the plan with Inrupt is "world sovereignty".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup business.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so people can create their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music librarys and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea of Inrupt is, according to the company's Executive Director, John Bruce, to collect resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week, technology developers worldwide can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change everything completely, so that all their business models suddenly become excessive."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a list of media in Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.

Bernard Water: Spiritual receiver of the Victoria Cross from World War I is celebrated
The only priest of the English Church, who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during the First World War, is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
Saturday, a memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Water, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning business.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water on September 29, 1918 led his batalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavily shooting from machine guns and artillery."
Later he ran to the front line and led out his people with the "largest man's courage" before he himself attacked a artillery and unsaided three cannons.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Water, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Water also made a crown after the parade, which was mentioned by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Water said that he was "feeling very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underlines the true heroic courage."
MMA fans got up all night to see Bellator 206, but got Gurli Gris instead.
Imagine that you've been up all night to see the star-decked Bellator 206 and then it's refused to see the main event.
There were 13 matches on the program from San Jose, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown throughout the night in England at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald made themselves ready to meet each other, the viewers in England became somewhat surprised when the transmission changed to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for just this struggle.
A fan on Twitter described the change to a child drawing movie as "a kind of sick joke."
"According to the legislation, this content was not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Seniorvice President of Bellator, when he was asked for the issue.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, stated that they will work to include English viewers in future planning.
"When thinking about the re-emission, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But it's six Sunday morning over there, and we don't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the matter.
Believe me when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually the law.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We have five fights instead of six, which we normally do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "less" over sexuality
The Olympic diving Tom Daley says that he felt less worth than everyone else in his grown up because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn't go to him until he came into the bigger classes that "all isn't like me."
When he was at Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that he was less up to win the Olympia after becoming a parent.
The usual was on the radio program that has been driving for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken free a few months because of disease.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said he felt "less worth" than anyone else in his grown up because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, "From today the feelings of remembering and feelings different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality.
The double olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and has used its participation in Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others hope.
The threefold world champion said he had been "awhile" when he was in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, which he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, but told me that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told us that it is difficult to find someone in the same age who has experienced similar up- and downturns when you go through as much in such a young age – he went to his first Olympic as 14-year-old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that "his entire perspective" had changed."
"If you asked me last year, everything would be if I was to win a gold medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than olympic gold medals.
My olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and first I realized that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – to shower in front of a home public at Olympia. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song choice – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant much during the uptake to the Olympic and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uscarp Mickelson on Ryder Cup's bank on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson sets record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it doesn't want to be a sad milest.
Mickelson, who places record for 12 times in the competition, which will be settled every 2 years, was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk due to the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the events of the United States as usual, the fivedubble big winner had to act on the hills and practice in the hope of fixing the sweeps.
Even at the climax of the career he had the most equal drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the track at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishes lost shots.
And if the track wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson must meet the always precise winner of British Open Francesco Molinari at the ninth battle on Sunday, who has joined the newer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four battles this week.
If the Americans, who start the 12 single fights, start strongly, Mickelson's fight may be crucial.
Fury did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, gave me a knock on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and this week too.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's what it should be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldo's record for most played matches in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career who has never completely been able to measure with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven indefinite, although Furyk said that his presence contributes with something indefinite.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, funny, he likes to go to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just the game."
Captain Thomas Bjørn of Europe knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European Captain Thomas Bjørn knows of experience that a solid leadership before the last day of Ryder Cups single-up can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advance over the Americans, but was just about to be obtained before the target line with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice leadership in Valderrama, we had a nice leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total leadership of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have full waste tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus lies.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what is on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Enjoyed with the performance of his players on a difficult level added Bjørn: "I don't take anything of this as of course.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performance that counts, and it's something completely different.
It's amazing to be out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're out there alone, you are tested on all parameters as a golf player.
That's what the players need to understand – get the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he will also get the best in himself."
Otherwise, it looks to the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk itself has experienced cows on the last day. First at the winner team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle on Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a huge pressure on the intermediate fights.
We compose our team in relation to it and put the players on the board in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the backslide and face Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play the first half in order.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warships are delayed again
The latest fregat of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War, but the Germans must wait at least one year for technical problems and a escalating price, writes local media.
The introduction of the largest ship in the entire new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregatters, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been deferred to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but dispatch problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, shall replace the ageing fregates of the Bremen class.
They know that they want a strong cannon, a large range of anti-air shoots and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest fregates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the fregats away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which is supposed to make Germany appear as a supersale power factor – will already be obsolete when they are introduced, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 fregate created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamborg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for return, but German media mentioned a number of crucial "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusable in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance when the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – it is only half of that crew from the older Bremen freights.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and reduced the fleet's potential for future updates.
The 7000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project that includes training of the crew is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has reached a dizziness of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet force is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German State Defence Committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "runs out of clear ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the fregattes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust Snippets to the Secret Life of the Flag Muses
New research from a region in Scotland is trying to reveal how flagermus uses the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the finds will throw light on the behavior of the unique, flying mammals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common flagermus, dwarf bat, long-dry flagermus and water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in closely selected locations in the area to record the activities of the flager mice through the season.
Data from NTS and volunteers are also collected using handheld detectors.
Depth analysis of the audio recordings will reveal the frequencies of the flager muscles and show what kind of what is doing what.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behavior, a report and a map of habitat is made.
Nature conservation advisor for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal the most important areas of the habitat and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of angels and how to best preserve forest areas for flagermus and similar species.
The number of flager mice in Scotland and the UK has fallen drasticly over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban enlargement projects that affect and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger.
Flagmus is actually not blind.
But because they mainly hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced ecolocation techniques to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flager mice very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect reds and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organization has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated flager mice reserve in the area of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight out of ten of Scotland’s flager mice species.
The career of the area, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territorie for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for flagermus," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
There is a lot that you don't know about flager mice, so the work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to enjoy."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flagermus before making maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and kids, thus risking to destroy a whole local population.
Flagmus is peaceful, and it is illegal to kill, shame or disturb them or their riders.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader of Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to give a hand.
She said, "We still have a lot, we need to learn about our flager mice, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the population develops."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, while lawyers suspect German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape accusation against him "fair news" and says people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news media, Der Spiegel, who brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raped a American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375.000 to keep it secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being "fair news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on account of the accusations they have called, according to Reuters, "a unforgivable disclosure of suspects of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class corresponding to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reported to take place in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting each other at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he must have raped her anal according to the report submitted in the court of the town in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on his knees after the claimed event and said he was "a good guy 99% of time" grabbed by "one percent".
The case papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later she agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "bound for revenge" and worried about being "publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old now says that she will reverse the agreement, since she is still deeply affected by the claimed event.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event should have taken place, and switched to the Italian large club Juventus for €100 million this summer.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret forever" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it lost its status as world leader car manufacturer after Brexit, said Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily decrease production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting at the border in the case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year where 90% of these were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop in our factory if Britain is smoking out of the EU at the end of March," said Burnaston, Marvin Cooke, Executive Director.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers has to deal with risks with the supply chain in the event of an uncontracted withdrawal.
Toyota's production runs on a tight timetable where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU.
If Britain leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, problems at the border could arise which, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's production at Derbyshire factory, and then the production would be stopped, the company stated.
Clark says that the Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "compositioned, so that these checks are exactly avoided at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best deal that does not just allow us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success but to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we have to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would have been stopped, but in the long term higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a common truster in the factory, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not return."
A spokesman of the government said, "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "be disposed of a week more", as the settlement of Brett Kavanaugh, the High Court of Justice, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special accuser Robert Mueller over his shoulder during his study of Russian election interference, relations between Trump's helpers and Russia and the President's possible obstacle to the trial.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence, has been a slate in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein thought to wear a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of disposing the President through the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor went on that he would say up.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, which was at that time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's judicial hearing, where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, should witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate's choice.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I like always to keep the press updated."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders have not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists' games for the gallery, but added: "I don't agree that they play up to the camera."
She then said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We've seen the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give it a rich opportunity, and you have seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high-level guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure before the present journalists.
Health Minister contacts EU staff in the Scottish health care system following Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and desire that they follow Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than half a year before Britain withdraws from the European Union.
The government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the expiry continue, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
But the British Government has also increased their preparation for any Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts each employee has made, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU provide valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of the health care system to the benefit of patients and the community.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after head damage
The lineback from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after having suffered a head injury in the Saturday 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores, it says from Tennessees Mike Organ.
First trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event occurred before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell around there," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put him on a bear and took him into further investigation.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombies operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there is no "no details about the type or extent of the damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he took on the damage.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is in progress with its first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five applauses on Saturday before he left the battle, giving him 18 cabs gathering this season.
Foreign buyers are charged with higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged with higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. The extra money is to help the homeless, according to the conservative party.
This move must weaken Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to make $120 million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged with a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The drag will be considered an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers with promises of cheaper housing and walking after them with the highest income.
The increase in stamp tax will affect persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The profit from this must be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The additional fee, which is placed above the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multiple home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot inside the housing market.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "sight cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction and construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying grounds they don't use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to resolve the "shameful housing situation of Britain."
Corbyn has proposed an outstanding number of housing reforms, including the check of rent prices and the withdrawal of the renter's ability to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing buildings.
May said: "I said last year that I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means to repair our non-functioning housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be appropriate that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as for hard-working British.
For all too many, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the insignificance of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's trainer"
The Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimative goal" is at a time to become Scotland's trainer.
The 42-year-old shot enjoys the challenge of reliving the North East club, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the stadium of Light this summer after having led St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership in the last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
"I played a fight with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it's always drawn in me.
However, that option would only arise if I had success in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer for Alloa Atletic says that he had no concerns about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success from "I can get this club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy job, but I'd like to see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period of assisting trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart's coach stack.
Then he helped Alloa come back after having been pulled down into the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the depression threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more fit now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real divorce," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I really thought that the training was the right thing for me, more right than being a player.
That sounds strange because I did it well, served wisely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There is still such stress and pressure that trains, but it feels just right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't been more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturdays at 17.30, shows the study
The heat wave this summer has increased the earnings of England's pubs, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
Sales on pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has gone down 4.8%, shows numbers.
Peter Martin, who is corporate consultant at CGA and has collected the figures, said: "Continue sunshine and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows the pattern of June, where the pubs experienced a surplus of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are harder hit now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubbers and bars focused on the sale of drinks made it clear and experienced progress equivalent to the decline of restaurants.
Pumps with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
Throughout the pub and bark chains, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6% per month, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, analyzer of the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sale on the outside home market, weather and major social or sporting events are the biggest factors.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still fighting, although a fall in sales of 4.8% year after year will really hurt above increasing costs.
The long, warm summer couldn't come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give a hardly needed breathing space."
The total increase in sales collected for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.
Coffer Peach Tracker, who monitors sales for the English pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes data from 47 different groups. Their annual turnover is more than 9 £ billion, and they are leading in the area.
Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Each fifth child – up to 11 years – has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows research.
A study of 20,000 school students in 4-9th class reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they can show their parents.
Every fifth child up to 11 years of age creates accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the fourth class reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the image sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" which they can show their parents while they also have private.
A mother, who fell over her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, saw a teenager who invited others to "rape me".
The study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for Private Schools found that 40% of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It is terrifying that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Board of Scottish Atletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the change as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys great prestige in the athletic world in Scotland, Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her in the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can contribute and help in choosing a direction for sports in Scotland."
The American who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200 and 400 metres races at the OL in Atlanta in 1996, which is now often a commentator for BBC, could not go after a transitoric ice cream attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time would show whether I would get up on it and in what degree.
It's been hard work, but I'm very healthy, I've learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows gets mixed receipt online
A breast pumping company has shared the opinions online with a advertising comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a jewel that is filled with highs, to a song in which it says, "Yeah, I'm painting myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't my breasts."
The circuit sounds, "Push it out, pump it out, I'm feeding my child, pump it out, pump it out, I'm damping my barm."
But the advertising that has been published on the company's Facebook page has resulted in controversies online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mixed reception from the viewers. Many say it makes fun of "the fears" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.
Elvie breast pump fits discretely in a breast bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "It's understandable that it's traumatic for both mother and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another one added, "What an insensitive advertising."
Others defended the advertising.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I still breastfeed, I would have had one.
Lactation made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It's a fun advertising aimed at mothers pumping milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feels like "cows".
It is not a advertising that commends or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bhs.
The concept behind the advertising is based on that many women who breast-feed say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely soundless, has no pipes or snakes and fits discreetly in a breast-bh, which gives women freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and director of Mother, wrote: "The pump from Elvie is a so revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provoking launch.
By dragging a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while we showed in a entertaining and recognized way the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that the Elvie pump has created headlines.
In the London Fashion Week, a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children in secret moved to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of retained migrant children has exploded, although the number of borderers has not changed. It is partly due to a harder retoric and the scrapper laws of the Trump administration that make it harder to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their chance to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The return risk increased in June when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed to the Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unleased minors.
The management later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested persons had pure penalties.
"That is 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households remain illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," said Albence.
In the attempt to deal more quickly with children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules which require some of them to meet in the court within a month after their retirement.
Many use video calls instead of meeting themselves and speaking their case for legal stay to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified to stay are deported quickly.
The longer children remain in care, the more likely they are to get anxiety or depression that can lead to violent outcomes or refugee attempts, it is said by helpers and in reports from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better conditions say that these risks are more pronounced in larger plants such as Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to monitor a child’s suffering.
They added that relocation to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can raise traumas that many are already fighting with.
Syria informs U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" that they must withdraw immediately.
When Syria's Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-President, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the presumption of combating terrorism, and they will be "meeted with equivalent means."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "nest is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have escaped from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this decisive war until we have cleared out all Syrian areas" for both terrorist groups and "unfair foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab armies who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the armed country.
In the area of refugee, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return home, then he accused "some western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fear", which caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these homes," he said.
"They are politicians of what should be a pure humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack from Syrian armies supported by Russia was avoided against the province of three million.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions will go after jihadists from the Nusrafront, an outspringer group of Al-Qaeda, which "will be destroyed".
The United Nations Sender Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon to the first meetings of the new committee in order to declare a post-war Constitution for Syria and to pave the way for a choice, which consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the committee and has stated that the panel's work should be limited to "examining the legislation of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
That's why Trump wins another presidential period.
Based on that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the Court of Justice and the scandals end his presidential period in advance, as many liberal viewers hope.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
At present there is no sign of seer tiredness.
Since 2014, the seer numbers in the best time of sending have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tridobled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best time of sending compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in evenings with great news.
"It is a spectacle that people are attracted to because it is nothing we understand," said Neal Baer, leading the ABC Drama Designated Survivor about a chairman of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and author behind "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi tour in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell.
The chaos has the value of entertainment.
Unlike all other television programs, however, the stories coming from Washington can decide the matter between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Switching channel is only the most privileged wonder.
And yet it's more than being an informed citizen when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's coat for $15,000 ("coated with hybris", wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's live descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I never want to see Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every evening," said Brent Montgomery, manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of "Pawn Stars", about the trump-show's rotating crew and daily surprises (discovery with N.F.L, commendation to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, which was to be heard in the Senate's judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large sums find the way to the closest midway choice to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensation of two Congressional Districts, two Congress members fight for the same seat.
This recently embraced suburban district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won its seat in another special choice last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting Congress member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing Pennsylvania's 12th district, which is overlapping strongly with the new 17th.
The cards were converted, after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January sentenced that the old territory was legally set up in the forehead of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17 district has launched a fight for economic resources between the committees of the great parties, the Campaign Congressional Committee of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice with high surveillance in March's special choices for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the Republicans' hands for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give democratics a small advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for support to China, but changed its minds.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners cast out Trump's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back leading American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a report earlier in the month.
But only El Salvador was punished. They received about $140 million of the United States in 2017 to bla.Drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts of financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings went forward, Northern and Central American officials launched a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued the last year meeting considered to be a step to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference planned for mid-October to send a signal on the importance of the Americans at the meeting, said diplomats.
And the three U.S. trains sent back secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard demands or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman of Bolton from the White House did not wish to comment on the details of the matter described by three American officials, including two diplomates who would like to talk about internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider analytist who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the basis of a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle could well be the special accuser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstacle to the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
It is said that Mueller will also examine whether Trump's campaign in secret cooperated with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If the Congress should come on new hands, Trump will probably be put to responsibility while he prepares for again to meet the voters and, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I do not claim that Trump's ultimately is inevitable – and the same applies to his contradictions in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit a government coup against Hitler, if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath.
It is about such turning points that the axis of history is turning, and the inevitable march of democracy is declining or diminishing.
In the United States, several of these turnpoints are now faced.
What if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper could communicate that last year he had proposed to make hidden recordings of the President and contested his suitability for the office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is stopped or not implemented properly – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false evidence?
And, more importantly, will we vote for the mid-term election for a convention that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe that we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who once occupated my embassy country.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to turn the Sabbath light on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be more optimistic than that in the baggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic in advance of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive SK Rapid Vienna on Thursday. After the impressive undefinite result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they will have good opportunities to come forward with a victory against the Austrians from Group G of the Europe League.
A knee damage prevented the midway player Graham Dorrans from getting season debut before the 2-2-fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a jump board for something even larger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with the belief that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but it was probably a reasonable result at all.
They were probably best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
We hope to get three points, but it'll be difficult because they got a good result in the last fight, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
Last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my damage and changes in the club, but the atmosphere is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive on now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Fear of pension saving makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants of the study had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared, there were only few who talked to the family about it.
About half of the participants in Nationalswide's survey reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their mate.
Only 10 percent told me they talked to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalswide Life Insurance Company.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your mate and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you do not tell them about your desires in good time.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices may be crucial factors for the costs.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed by traditional long-term insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have a economy for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal fights in the arrival.
Get a full authority prepared so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also a financial power.
If so, you will appoint a trusted person who can make economic decisions and ensure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that one of your ageing parents needs medical care and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Get all these details down on writing, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question about the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who's watching the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, middle floor and hand.
The officer describes the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m., as "unfortunately."
The victim didn't see the killer.
His damage is not life-threatening, and the police invite witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communications routes are out of play, emergency staff have not been able to receive information from the government of Donggala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7,5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulavian province and is located at the bottom of a smal bug on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which had an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Donggala is a rulership that extends over 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, a administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basic pillars of the central Sulavian economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is mainly taking place in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster centre, Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami, who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically on the so - called fire ring in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in the northern Sumatra triggered on December 26 a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and until April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Niaz on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake that measured 6.8, hit south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that drove to the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake was affected near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake that measured 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit Pidie Jaya the kingdom of Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of 2004's deadly earthquakes and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist-eye Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily on the beach.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son aimed for violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor in Alaska and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicion of violence at home, preventing the notification of violence at home and opposing arrest, according to the report sent by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman's acquaintance when she tried to report the claimed crime.
Palin is the maintenance prison in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a caution of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "unclearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is sentenced for three Class A violations, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been sentenced for a class B infringement, which can lead to a punishment on a single day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been sentenced for violations.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
The case is currently under treatment at Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was sentenced for violence at home, to have prevented the notification of a violent crime at home and arms possession in a affected state in the event.
His girlfriend accused him of giving her a hit in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s violent behaviour with PTSD due to his dispatch in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake on Friday, the Indonesian island of Sulawesi fell.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami, which destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication roads, and the number of dead is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media circulates videos that currently show where the earthquake affects.
Hundreds of people were assembled for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when the tsunami shredded to the coast.
Public prosecutors are trying to get terrorist suspects in the NYC rarely sentenced death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to be sentenced to Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment that was last sentenced for a crime in the State in 1953.
30-year-old Saipov used in October a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where footers and cyclists who came in the way were hired down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the accusers must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the Declaration of Death sentences in the Southern District of New York.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both these sentences.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury could present Saipov for a prosecution of 22 points, including eight accusations of murder in connection with gangsters, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "wide planning and preparations," said the accusations and described Saipov's execution as "absurd, evil and depressed."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injury, body damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the Declaration.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's a decade ago that New York's southern district last traveled the accused in a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers but ended with lifelong prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last sentenced in a state case in New York in 1953, and the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for spies on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, did not prove any sign of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the detectives that he was doing well with his works.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag up at his hospital room, told the police.
He has denied himself guilty of the 22 points of the prosecution.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" over the decision of the accusers.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong penalty without the possibility of release only will extend the trauma of all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the accusations not to go after death penalty.
The Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army" during a demonstration at the Conservative Meeting today.
The former Ukip leader stated that politicians could be able to "mark the pressure" from the Eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the European Union.
The conservative Member of the House, Peter Bone, said to the demonstration in Birmingham that Britain would have been out of here if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge to create a collection in the deeply divided party is emphasized by the participation of conservative remainers in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his compromise level on the track under attack from both brexitees, remains and the EU.
Her allies insist that, despite the relapse, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – and thereby force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "kaos".
For the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would crawl the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
The minister of Wellingborough added: "I want to fight for Brexit, but we're going to scream Chequers."
Regarding the background of his EU resistance, he said: "We did not fight wars to be subjects of someone.
We will decide our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that the opinion of the public should have changed since the vote in 2016: "The fact that the British people should have changed their views and want to stay in the European Union is completely wrong."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also for the demonstration and told the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unpopular in the broad population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, which are actually on the street and get us elected in.
Now drop Chequers, and start listening to.'
As a point of remark to May, she added: "Presidents keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the procession that politicians should be able to "mark the pressure" if they fail the decision from the vote in 2016.
"Now it is a question of confidence between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They'll betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we don't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, who is in the nick of betraying Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We mobilise the army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-controlled and proud United Kingdom."
While remains marched through Birmingham before a to-timer tournament in the city center.
Spread activists vifted with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour colleague Lord Adonis did laugh before the meeting with the security problems with the Conservatives' party app.
"It is the people who claim that they have control over the IT systems and technology to Canada, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's totally funny.
There's nothing that's called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "consideres strongly" to bring up the presidential elections
Member of Senator Elizabeth Warren of the House of Representatives "consideres strongly to stand up to the presidential election" after the mid-term election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the democratic of Massachusetts spoke of his future during a city council meeting on Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticised Donald Trump, will in November try to achieve re-election against the State Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-president at the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It's been wondering if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters in the city hall since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she was planning to set up the presidential election.
Warren answered that it is time that "women go to Washington and repair our political system, and that requires a woman in front."
Arrest in the case of shooting at LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that on Friday a suspect was arrested for the shot murder at Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for a ET news meeting at 11 p.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shots in his head and died by the damage," said the police leader Murphy J. Paul, according to the media 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to be present, possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in the police at East Baton Rouge District.
Sims was a two meters high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. During the last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the world championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a crucial role for the race.
From the driver position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off when he defended his position in the first two swings and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was driving as the first and left Hamilton to fight with traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went in a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when the Ferrari driver had to leave the inderban reluctantly after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the backer row and was number seven after the first round on his 21th birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race when he, in an attempt to quickly finish, failed to switch tyres to take Kimi Raikkon's fourth place.
He had to go in the 44th round, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight rounds, why the Raikon secured the fourth place.
"It's a hard day, because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team made an incredible piece of work to ensure us both first and second place," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the High Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the witness that Ford had given before the US Senate's Judicial Committee, but instead said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "wrong and dishonest and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has happened the last few days of the Senate when you see the anger when you see people who are wrathful and wicked and dishonest and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks, they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... was it you leaking the document – "oh, oh, what?
No, no.
I haven't leaked anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added in an imitator of the senator.
Feinstein received the letter on Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I haven't hid Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't leaked her story," said Feinstein to the comedian according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confident, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the President, who said at Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you that it was really a bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president's continued defence of the nominated Judge to the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, Trump proposed that the Democrats use the accusations to benefit their own case.
"They don't avoid any means in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the evilfulness, the disgusting things they don't care who they need to drum for power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars did it well again after Friday's Elite League lost fight against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly arrived with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated at home before Dwyer brought Giants back ahead.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of Adam Keefe's team that came from the back to beat Dundee 2-1 on Friday's fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the pages, where Giants went out as victory masters in the three previous battles.
Dwyer spent the fourth minute at 3:35 from a assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as a assistant, when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy first period, Sullivan brought home team back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownies compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants came ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard recompensated with a great goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated in helping Nielsen to lead Dundee ahead for the first time in the battle late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who have now lost four out of their five fights, are home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Aeroplane leader died to ensure that hundreds of passengers escaped earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is celebrated as a whole after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers was safely coming down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing, after a larger earthquake in Friday hit the Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy afterquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agungs colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the swollen control tower in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the startway, was safe to get into the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was just crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Talsman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said, according to Australian ABC News, his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We're broken," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach thousands, and the country's disaster preparedness informs that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death count is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes fly in emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the shops are robbed."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to do.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work all day round to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" he said, CNN.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says now that a man is missing after the air crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed in the Pacific, Micronesia, now says that a man is missing, even though previously it had been reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the falling plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini says that Saturday afternoon could not locate a male passenger.
The airline announced that local authorities, hospitals and police were collaborated to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local both helped to save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been driven to the hospital.
The airline says that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both state that the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the landing train.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was flying by the landing track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go into water to life to get to the emergency exits of the falling plane.
He said that the crew was panicking and yelling and he had a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that sailors working to renovate a cage nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to freight people in land before the plane fell at about 30 meters deep.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines in the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analytics define the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The accusation authority concluded its proofing on Saturday during the case of a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analytics at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, issued witness statements for several hours as experts in data analysis.
He described for the jury how he used telephone information to compete for the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he claimed he visited Sanford with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford sat in the Witness room Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another dispute was that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at one time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is planned to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a review in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Child girl in New York case pairs after firing with "racist" texts
A child girl in New York suspects a couple of too discriminatory fires after having been sent a text message by a mistake from the mother who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the search with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed his fear of finding that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEJ, NOT ENDNU AND SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, it fired the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former child girl, as from African-American, had been bad for her work and that she instead expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day's work and sent home in a Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice's pair to get a replacement for the fire and compensation for $350 a day for the six months where she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't allow to do this," she said to the newspaper Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has defended with the fact that they are not racists and that the fire of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone whom you had been obscured, even if it had happened by a mistake?
Your infant?
Honestly."
Plasco compared the application with "expression" and that his wife had born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you really go after someone that way?
This is not very friendly," added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still in progress, the Court of Justice has already deprecated the pair of social media and has embarrassed their behaviour and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers could not relate to a speaking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was released, said about the letter: "It's hard to imagine to be the one reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little clothing beam, would have been optimistic, even though his story was rejected and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father in all modestness was proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he didn't like to cry," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not really your earnings.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Said goodbye to the dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was driven to hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nod called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll see you soon.
See you later.
The medicine she had received to keep her heart in progress slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now she shut down her body.
I just had to sit there waiting for it to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together."
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse went on board on the plane with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I bent my head, and the tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women are trying to stop suicide jumpers
Two women who have lost their own suicide attempt to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up maps on a Walish bridge with inspiring messages and telephone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he had a depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I endure every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with a infected smile.
"He smiled was known by everyone.
People said his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him after he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "tell people that there is someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't take your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone."
Sharon Davis's long-year-old friend, Kelly Humphrey's, lost her boyfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about that he was sorry or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas he began to change.
When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic to them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has ripped us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still inaccurate, while the FBI starts research
"I thought that if we could actually get something like that he asked for – a limited time-limited investigation with a limited size – we might get a little agreement," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the commemo was "falling out of the hind" in the middle of the fixed partial situation.
Why would Kavanaugh and his republic supporter not have the FBI to do their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The midway elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the republics, as expected, do not work well, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have chosen for the highest judicial office of the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes their report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give vice-president Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean shoppers fall under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean shoppers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Merge and said that there were 1.127 disrupters last year compared to 2 7006 in 2011.
Park noted that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers contributed to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In time, the majority of North Korean dishes are offered citizenship in South Korea.
The Government of South Korea says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border encouraging to North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China regards the procurement as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, so they are often forced to be sent.
The relationship between North and South Korea – which is technically still in war – has been significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the coastal negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This is happening after the historical meeting in June between the American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at a general level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho gave American penalties the blame for the lack of progress.
"No confidence in the United States there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we will refrain from ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to the Supreme Court
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, which is nominated for the Supreme Court's judgments, "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comment came in an interview Saturday to the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like that, it would have been called her hysterical," said Pelosi on his response to Kavanaugh's witness statement before the Senate's court committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected emotionally the accusations that he had committed a sexual offense against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke of his family and his years at high school, he almost shouted and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats of the Committee and called the accusations against him "great and coordinated character courage" arranged by the left wing that was angry with the fact that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he followed the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi went outside when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a Kingdom court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats are given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I want to say that if he does not speak the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not suitable for sitting in the Supreme Court, but certainly in the court he is sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently sitting as Judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or the case of abortion Roe v. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer any questions about whether he would reverse certain former Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, predetermined person must dispute a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it is not just nice'," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger, that's overcome, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal.
She continued: "I got great support by a woman who was the boss who said that she also wept when she became angry, but that she developed a technology that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she would say to the one she spoke to: "You might think that I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are understood.
One of my most obvious memories is from one of my first jobs in a office with overweight of men, where I often cryed of anger, where I was taken at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little scared of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll take care of the fact that they got hit on you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of the Democrats of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and pulling out as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and concluded that she could as well as well stand up as a president candidate.
"It wasn't a very transparent decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the circuit, and they certainly didn't need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with fundraising, so she promised that she would not take part unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she thought.
When she held a speech that she would not stand up, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to travel money and now to choosers instead of choosers, and anger over sexism – that she had a chunk in her throat.
"You could believe I had a nervous association," Schroeder recalls how the press responded to her.
"You should think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking what is going to write on my grave stone?
"She cryed?"
This could be the advantage of the trade war between the United States and China for Beijing.
The opening sales in the trade war between the United States and China were loud, and even though the struggle is far from over, divisions between the countries can be a benefit for Beijing in the long run, says experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by putting duties on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest eskalation in this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion is in principle applicable to half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has repayed each time, by adding customs duties of 5 to 10 % to US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s second largest economy is probably not giving up just in the meantime.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means they give up, but for China's President, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bend to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the US pressure in the trade war may have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A fast decision in either Washington or Beijing can create a gross fund for a economy that can come out of control in both countries, and it is actually far more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, researcher focusing on Asia at the thinking centre of New American Security.
Syria is 'clear' to receive refugees, believes the Foreign Minister
Syria says that the country is ready for refugees to return and asks for help to build the country destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country were in progress.
"Today the situation is more stable and safe thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now present for refugees to return to the country that they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral financial sanctions that hit their daily and livestock.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since 2011, where war began.
Additional six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the inflicted country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that were involved in supporting the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and hit the American team 16,5 - 10,5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trofee back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points that it required to strike the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it difficult mostly of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake on pair 3 on 16 holes, which caused him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest ranged European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the World Range List, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spainrd Sergio Garcia, became the most winning Europeans of the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't do for it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
It is a team effort, and I am glad that I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the fakle to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golf player Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It's a joke statistics for one of the best golf players ever won 14 big titles, only passed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had the whole weekend trouble finding the shape with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show: "I'm proud of the boys, because they fought for the matter.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe opposition.
We lost.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players really played good.
We want to regroup, and I want to cooperate with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will continue.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to look at the hat.
We were defeated."
