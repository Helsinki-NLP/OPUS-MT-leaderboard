28-year-old Koch found in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he could imagine no one who would want to hurt him, "Everything went up with him again."
The body found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, informed the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had taken his dream job as a cook at Sons & daughters' restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & daughter said that they were shocked over his death and destroyed on the ground.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we're going to miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia argued that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things finally went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia informed KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could imagine no one who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His kind of association with his family was always to cook us something to prepare for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of controversy.
He was the brother who was swimming with the stream.
"In everything that went wrong in the world, he was this unsleeved diamond that lighted light every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case shall be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview now.
"I'll always be put in drawers or get embedded from outside labels that mostly have little to do with me and the reality."
"I don't want to always be perfect and successful."
"Finally, these things are rather cutting me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about her being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, forming TV with loose dutt and mexican food, says in the magazine.
To white glow she brings the question of the child's wish: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is seen as a single parent of two sons.
The film is running with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a trip on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home to the nuts of feeding.
A mile at this speed, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament wins - was back near horses.
He was able to lead himself with his family over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he wasn't even pregnant for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was convincing.
The German sports aid delivered the golden sports pyramid to the man from home in the context of a small gala.
Awards do not lack the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Service Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has adored him.
Longer is the 18th prize carrier of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prizemaker Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means very much to me," says Langer, "for she will be forgiven not only for sports success but also for social commitment."
For decades longer has promoted the descendant.
And so he also gave the price money of 25.000 euros as well.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master winner was taken into the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
Among the excellent athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the tournament Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Takeer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schokochem and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these athletes had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society walked to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidency candidates agree on tax and energy policy as well as on a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns about how the state of economy can hurt - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claims Trump.
He is going to reverse regulations massively, and he makes itself strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to be fulfilled, it has disadvantaged chances to open and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost at the same time.
The democratic applicant has announced the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical theaparty flies of the Republicans.
Thus, on Trump could still be part-internal discussions.
More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-drive coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris climate protection agreement will be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, both of us do not want to isolate the USA from international trade - but just better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says that the minimum wage must be raised, then he says that it may not be changed.
However, the great discussion of the next few months is probably more likely to develop about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to discharge the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.
His critics believe that the budget deficit would only be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand the riches to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Refuge: "Every refugee woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that's not more than one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curiously into the room with great eyes.
His mother stares on the table plate.
Until she notices she's being watched.
She smiles shortly and kisses the little one.
The scene works normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the district business leader of Condrobs, a social aid provider in Bayern, and is among other things involved in the subject of women fleeing.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-in-flying women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Assistance.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say: Every woman coming here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Mans flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them as hopekeepers to Europe," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are: "Many are stealing from it secretly because they don't see any other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced sight, honor murders, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what's going on with them.
It's going on on the run.
"The sleepper, for example, requires a bottle of water to act sexually, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, says Bahr.
Also here, lonely women in refugee accommodations would often be considered to be less valuable and abused in the worst case.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in Munich north are traumatic.
"Some of the children have not been voluntarily created."
Many women would be so used that they wouldn't say anything.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often do not know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, demands Bahr.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the residence of refugees.
The question whether they know about a project similar to that in Munich in their field of competence, some answer no.
There is no such thing in government housing in the upper stake and superfranks.
Also in Schwaben, refugeed women are not separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In upper bayers, sub- and medium-sized francs, there are floors or homes in some Community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayers, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.
In a study published to the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are separately accommodated."
"If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, violence against women can come to - persistent -."
Above all, the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.
How much the women feel this need of protection can be seen at the Andrang, which is at the house in Munich.
"Since we have spoken around that we are there, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: demands for new labour fighting measures
Deputy representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new labour fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire Council to approve more work fighting from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it would have deprived Ministers to deal with the concerns relating to the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "perpetually calm" to problems, which led to the rejection of the Treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC has voted in favour of fully rejecting the proposed new Treaty and called for official negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating labour fighting measures starting at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to the six strikes of assistant doctors this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the choice to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, that the Treaty should be be beneficial and acceptable.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the Treaty for physicians in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: A "Alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end of the war of words and economic sanctions for eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't reject the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handwrap, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed slimly, and he had little heat, even for his restraints.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have acted as if something was never done bad.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's Head of State had not forgotten anything.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighting aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s response at the time was burned.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling in Russia.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vetrue will be difficult if not even become impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state - controlled media had a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed as if the Turks were blamed for everything.
The most serious was the accusations of governing officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria which were controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He disputed this fee.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to book a type of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a gun stop are clearly on the hand.
Erdogan needs mainly all friends he can get after he was removed last month at a failure of his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia travel organisers and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are restarted.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, public television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were restored.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes along this way."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West because it considers its response to the attempted power acquisition as a weak answer.
In addition, the continuing grief about the rate of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is aimed at benefiting from the cold mood and reducing Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian Head of State won with certainty a bonus in Ankara for requesting support for the selected government bodies after the attempted state strike.
This is well-noted for Moscow a self-evidentness that even has a deep-seated fear of change in regimes.
The summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present one, as a analyst once described to me, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that are violating from the West and feel badly treated and now bonding.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support counterpart sides.
It may be notable that after almost three hours of first talk, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not even taken the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open enmity - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when the NATO member of Turkey shot the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak with each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The brand RBS is intended to be reduced, according to the head of the Bank, to a backoffice roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has been distant since she had to be almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.
During this period, brand-stratant "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial marks.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon victory Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange notation will be switched to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visiting tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He informed the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will be our investor brand and the brand among which our employees will be employed, since we will become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something perfectly different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how are we focused inside (we have asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the head of the board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we'd be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettor achieves his 3,000th win at Newmarket at Predilection
Dettor sprays champagne for a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
On Friday, Jockey Frankie Detori secured his 3,000th UK profit at Newmarket.
He set on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race route with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, which reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettor, who won on Ghayyar before that, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm lightened and very modest.
Detori takes up the joy when he takes the victory at Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-year-old victory Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4.300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-fold Derbysieger had 4.493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma enthusiastic fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already earned 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding in GB for almost 30 years winners, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Detori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettor has been the dependent sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of large tower wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month block, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to despite his two-floors and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettor has once said that he wants to continue in competition up to his at least 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fires Chief Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, unfortunately released his Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest confidence circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed a special representative for environmental and transport matters.
In an opinion of the Kreml, Putin has ordered "the release of Ivanov's duties as chairman of the Russian Presidial Administration", without any reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been his alternate representative since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the renowned state Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it says (in Russian) that he was later the head of the government staff's protocol and staff manager.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This step made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Staff Chief resigned on his own wish.
But despite the smile for the camera, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once proclaimed as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - was a great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated posts - you might almost say - arbitrary posts for four years.
As it appears, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
He was formerly vice-president and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the CGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his alternate representative.
When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he was most familiar with.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But this post was taken by another allied Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced their termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcement.
At the set there were artistic differences and differences in opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Details about how Gibson's character is printed from the series that follows a team of FBI agents, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios are expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old who had previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg has joined the series since the first staffel in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have incurred my whole heart blood over the last twelve years," said Gibson in a release published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can wish for just a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth staircase is held on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in garden in Banff
A inhabitant of Banff asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandales that were sprayed out by a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the north cover of Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "closures" which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 sharper seals.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed until May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs, Keith Brown, visited the construction site today and was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epical measure in this project with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a hot activity which requires extremely precise tolerance for fitting.
Altogether, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock represents a significant milestone for each bridge project.
With this fantastic project, the lock is a future-based high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road cover and its connection to the North Tower Deck in the expansion, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or country side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.
Massive as the viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons weigh and had to be pulled up at an increase of approximately 3%.
Hekel, as the tolerances that the team was working on were small - on each side they were just a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Happy Still Alive"
Three men have "luck to be alive" after they were thrown before Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties swimming in safety while their boat continued by their own strength.
"We saw the boat turning around and imagining the worst," said the head of the Rescue Station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have waved the boat out of their reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a Boje hanging without rescue West.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water have luck uninjured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was loosened from the person who controlled the boat at the time of the boat.
Someone's been watching over these men today.
Heavy injured - Man's on his ex-friend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously hurt him.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized actors cut the clothing of his ex-friend.
When this came into the apartment, he entered them twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police were able to arrest the transgressor.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-friend's clothes, he called his mother.
Then it alarmed his sister.
Together with her lifemate, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her lifemate.
On the street, they met the ex-life partner of the man.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to his side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be taken much more into account in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes to the next meeting of the Council a "treatment concept of residence".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who is really supposed to build the cheap apartments?
A scheme is missing so far.
SPD-Fraction Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas will in future have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments."
However, the favourable apartments can also come up in stock.
However, the big issue in the Council House is, says Bratmann, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent in such areas, but at least 20 per cent of homes as social apartments."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible rules.
The left wants to be hard for investors.
Despite this, Bratmann says, a worsening of the situation in the residential market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear if we're gonna get the professionals.
However, the programme is still not complete: for the about 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, though, is the loss of more than 1300 cheap apartments whose support will expire in the next few years?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
To prevent this, according to the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm, outgoing links should now be purchased from the city.
In addition, it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price commitment.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved on a strike.
For in the West Town, deadlines will expire at the end of the year.
Approximately 1800 apartments can be returned to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners do not want this, the apartment building companies.
Because the number of social apartments in the western city is again drasticly increased, it is removed from the objective of the so-called interference.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few urban areas is supposed to no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will be movement in the debate.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU has to go in the boat."
They have concentrated on more building sites for single family houses.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that rewards
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children are not going out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens was complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a drawing series, playcards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture did the interest declined before publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was deferred by the massive demand that the server overloaded.
Within few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons, which are being tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "fotografed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "catched".
A generation that played the game when she was still younger joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "mean" person leaves back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays of Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance increase.
Many public education campaigns for health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time", "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look bad.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Regular sports will reduce your chances of sickness of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to introduce them here.
But the miraculous thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something out there that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - motion, fresh air and sunlight and fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are silly degraders who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports how it does this game.
The new will lose its irritation and the use will be abandoned in time.
However, due to Pokemon's success there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the active world and will help many people on hunting to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the damenturns
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
No effort on the bar.
Respiratory on the ground.
Brilliant on the whole line.
And now, finally, Olympia.
The 19-year-old American tournament climbed to the multifight title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympics.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafana.
The Americans Simone Biles turn on the bar during the single fight fine of women in the art tournament at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fighting title and the fifth in total, while fixing her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey was found an end in this moment.
This success makes it in the same liga as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, which brought her sports to new heights:
The last three years, Biles has dominated her sports, 15 world master medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympian of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
It expected her a final examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of over-dimensional expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after they won gold and silver in the single fight fine of women in the art tournament at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a proclamation mark at the departure celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was insisting on never to have planned the future during her long way to the top, this is not really true.
A part of its soil exercises - which contain their typical tumble passport - is voted on Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by Trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament, was trained in Boorman.
She has no longer lost a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013, a victory series that will last as long as it wants Biles.
Even though Mustafana was easily leading through two rotations, the picture was deceived.
Silver bars and soil towers - in which cars hold the world master title - kept.
She recovered with 15,433 on the sweat bar - and put another one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman gently embraced her when they expected her end-stage - a pure formality - and tears streamed to Biles brilliant red, white and blue eyeliners, than the vision she once described in her collective book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake to Mustafana.
This time the 22-year-old crew captain, called the Americans "Mamma," had a predicament.
After her soil exercise she was thrown to the audience kisslands, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new significance:
Police: 3 victims in series murders shot in the car when listening to music
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who have died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix while they were talking in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a entrance, the authorities said.
The killer fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police told us that the threefold murder seemed not to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting force led the detectives to become a closer view of whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people were killed in his country in nine attacks within four months and two more injured.
Howard informed the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nesse from late 1990s, a black BMW from late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on the place.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pick-up truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the series killer.
Detectives found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the few of his elderly companions, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't want to do that.
What's not at all wrong -- of course you've made it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested that he should be institutionalized.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people still do," explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit or cramp until his third year of life and he can't speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can run with support and bicycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has designed for "Please sing something before me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as with Edmund, as well as virus infections such as massages or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts can vary very much.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was always asking what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the prognosis for a long time because I don't expect her to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives cause for salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is expected to have more rainfall throughout the Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of Mississippis flooded over their shores and threatened with vast floods to extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and that assistance to the communities concerned is already on their way.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, informed that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand sacks were increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A flood warning system is used over large parts of the southern Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain.
In the south of Alabamas a fluid warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will likely reach the record level over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stream downward flood in Ascension Parish is a danger because they will only flow slowly into the Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09:00.
Rescue teams still flooded people from the river in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased strongly overnight.
He said that another step son who lives near him would have warned him.
"We wake up and the water streamed and streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my phone.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a rise of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fireguard in Gloster, where they had stayed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood "had spread rapidly" because there was still severe rainfall and that the authorities would hesitate to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday tomorrow from 13.75 inch rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably filled through the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS daughter WWL reported that a companion in Tangipahoa indicated 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, which were now overflowed.
The chief of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back into their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa municipality, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood, and sand sacks were provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said it was still raining on the golf coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but on Friday no one has been reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "blown by balls," survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell us that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents argued that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the lending, leg, arm and abdomen, but that he was conscious in his transportation to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his small body was broken through balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez informed the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was criticized in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he is expected to be healed again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Similarly, three men were shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were just checking whether they could be among one of the injured men of the criminals.
Detectives informed CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to be a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridges for storm guns, which were traced back to various storm guns, overlooked the tator.
It seems that it was clearly a continuing fight.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there were caves.
Thus, there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved," told Police Hutpmann Anthony Ginaldi the police in Philadelphia to the broadcaster.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently reviewing reports according to the monitoring video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-counter at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presenting under the women's olympia team in the turn and that for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer olympia since 1984 and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which seemed inspiring for many young girls in other skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and historic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one under the female tournament was an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympia winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to be witness to the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she delivered unexpected but masterly gymnastic routes.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is not how turning classes look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympia team will only have four tournaments in the team. In addition, this is last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks so that tournaments are a expensive sports, and tournaments are mainly in private tournaments, which are maintained by parents, which can continue the training, installation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these turning associations are in wealthy premises that can support the business.
In these associations the tournaments get their whole training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started turning.
We have to allow the community a lot of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to get a more vulnerable and easier accessible tour training.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events, we offered free and affordable turning in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and historic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth a high-quality turn that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for health and for educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this crew that makes thousands of young girls interested in turning and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is so exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic Guild and thanks, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association functions, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a election refused him.
In July Hunt had disclosed plans to force the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "Nowmansland" and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistants are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care for juvenile times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Assistant Committee, informed last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will hesitate the current employment crisis and not treat all doctors fairly."
In only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and time is expired.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes by discussions came to the government on the contrary and sometimes on a silence of ears.
That happened of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month about his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, abolish the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work fights.
The last strike at the end of April provided a post of nearly 13.000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and specialists were included in order to provide doctors with coverage on the strike line chain.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association functions.
The BMA wants a better weekly reward for the 54,000 assistants subject to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS staff, asked the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbeits fighting does not achieve any of the only few but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepares only anxiety, distress and interruption to patients, nurses and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded to the Health Ministry and other ministries positively to the concerns regarding the premium and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from professional expiry, training, mutual recognition of the teaching plan, educational leave and gender-specific remuneration in medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of cardiac infarction patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after the authorities have recommended to give this more people for a longer period.
The antiinflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffers another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fat materials in the arterial walls that form the location.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and block the blood flow to the brain, which causes a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The now published instruction draft by NICE recommends a 12-month dose of 90 mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60 mg with a twice daily administration of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all who have suffered a heart attack has another heart attack or stroke - often with disaster consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the haemorrhage - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness causes election fraud in Muslim areas to flourish
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on initiation of a government report for corruption from the office
A culture of political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities to be clearly ignored, as a devastating government report today revealed.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and council houses to ignore proof of election abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anticorruption king, said that the intimidation of choosers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up locking bands outside electoral cabins in order to protect intimidated choosers.
He recommends that choosers carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At present, an electoral must simply mention his name and address.
The report suggests that a person's finger is not removable when he votes in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls on the press to have more access to communal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against electoral fraud, but it is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that involves it," he said.
The report was organized by Downing Street as a result of the Torn Hamlet election scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman, after a Lithuania, should be declared corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics with rassismus and Islamophobia accusations to silence.
Rahman is supposed to have "made his campaign on the basis that it is the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a simulation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming view of the fraudulent choice of letters - in the elderly members of the Muslim Community, the pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guide of evidence to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence that pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistanian or Bangladesh background.
"There was concerns that... government institutions had deliberately ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric delivered 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition of political activists editing letter selection documents to stop "valuable harvesters".
The report considered by Theresa May also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the use of the electoral directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask choosers for your ID before you choose.
Use non-resistant ink on a person's finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
conduct systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are valuable.
A three-year limitation on requests for automatic letter choice.
Prohibiting political activists to edit complete letter choices and envelopes of letter choices.
The police have the power to set up blocks for election stations.
A legislative change which facilitates an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People's Act 1983 (Volksrepresentation Act 1983).
Photograph ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (excluding Wales).
Intensive training to ensure that employees apply the rule that choosers go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "wonderful" that after the Tower Hamlet's case, no penalty was issued.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate representative for corrupt and illegal practices due to a Lithuanian," he said.
It was declared guilty for a number of reasons for adequate - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
It also criticizes the ineffective "design controls" of the electoral registration departments of Council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of the parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the disturbing and detective spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy to Kate's cyclist double walker and other famous double walkers of Olympia athletes in Rio
Fans of the Olympiade 2016 in Rio have been advised this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the edge and band, which has proved to be an impressive double walker of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old olympician is far from the only athlete that fights for gold, who has his own famous double walker - at least not if you have to give faith to the social media.
To honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flipping on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood famouss.
The hunter and the wolf: U.S. crew member in the arch shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
Apart from Kate's double walker on the bike railway, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bow shooter of the Zwilling of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. crew in the archery Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after the pictures on which he looks terriblely similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appear.
In fact, the archer got the madness in the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see any great similarity myself, except for face hair," Brady informed the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm sure that's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year: the emerging similarity between the British winner Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafana, with her large, expressive eyes, is supposed to be able to go through as a double walker for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A walk higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "atletic version" of the inception actor
Another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun brown skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans, like a "atletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities
Theory put in the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Further popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which are almost identical to the actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the tournament Gabby Douglas, who shows her own beautiful, broad smiles similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "as a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m free-style swimming staircase disturbed audiences of the CBC life transfer of Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "as Mief went down" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimming stairs.
MacDonald, who had been taken to the CBS' commentator team to give more "color" could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimming the second stage of the swimming staffel 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to lock up the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimming woman from China "as a pig died"????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on a mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming staple for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter quickly and hard, where many spoke to him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how unsensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #angeekelt.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance was issued."
It was an unfortunately selected formula, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologized at the end more than 90 times for the people who responded to the notice about Twitter
The commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret the fact that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be radiated.
Yesterday night we quickly apologized to our spectators for sending and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimming woman and not to her as a person.
Yet, they were unpleasant and an unhappyly chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his comment, saying that it was not his intention that she was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the female swimming staffel in the CBC Olympic Sending, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry."
Buyers in Primark are disappointed by women who try in the middle of the business unaffected underwear
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try subcutaneous.
In order to worsen the situation, she swallowed the way she looked into it, pulled her out and placed her back to the shelf.
She stood on and tried four pairs of underwears in a business at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
The Primark shop in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the subheadings before she placed them back to the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she moved back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of subcutaneous pants from the equipment, pulled out her own trunks and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaking like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the subheads that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other subcutaneous pants before finally decided that she wouldn't like anything, go back to herself and go out.
"She did not seem to disturb that she observed someone - or to think about the person who would perhaps buy the subcutaneous ones she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How disgusting to think that someone would take subcutaneous ones home who had another person and who were not washed."
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs Davidson added: "As I have come with, the staff have tried to pull out the clothes after she went - which is as good as well."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of subpox and find out that another woman had her and went out again and they weren't washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August in our desk in Folkstone."
All products in question have been withdrawn from sales.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a great master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers in close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from front or back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your robbers.
When you are approached from the back, you should turn around as the first, so you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you strike it in the face with your free ellbow.
Then strike him with the knee into the panel and turn around while the attacker crushs up against pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the gun to him.
In case of attackers approaching from the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and rotate it, so that the attackers can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the weapon and strike the attacker on the breast, then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move backwards and direct the weapon to him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it presents Mizrachi.
But remember that it is safest for a robbery to surrender your money - unless you are no Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Travelers Ian Wright swallows his tongue for a guide to the dirtyest places in Europe
A British traveler undercovered his immune system and sweater flex of a serious test - by laying down some of Europe's most dirty and disgusting places.
The modernist and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, swoop his train on a Euro Shine, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a washing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before deflecting each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to do.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" revealed some surprising results.
The idea of licking off the washing button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely absurd, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen wash.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of darmbacters and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left behind that he sucked more than a bad after taste in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public landings on railway stations to wash buttons of toilets, the task made his immune system definitely under a test
In the film, he told: "Already as a child, I was relatively unaware of my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he got his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample stroke showed a luminometer of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their luminometers were over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "This is the worst thing I smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna lick it here because it's awful in here.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company places Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of darmbacters and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, sauces and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to view and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended by saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information on this in an interesting way.
I think the movie also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the government of the film, added: "Let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to make Ian look at them and others that were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty leakages into a movie."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all bacteria in question, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestine, said that they use at least sometimes products containing added milk acid bacteria.
Asian family destroyed before deloging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A Asian family left her social apartment after a delogy with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the home company found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clapping holes, wooden parts were crushed, waste was scattered on the floor and gravfiti was swallowed at the walls.
The family has been resettled and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into account as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that had brought to the family included road fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of inhabitants, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rent contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be cut off, old garbage was found
In the property in which drugs have been traded in the past, the wooden parts have been screwed up
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to be called to the police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner violently from the property this week after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to take out voluntaryly.
The delogy was rejoiced by enlightened neighbors who said that their life was made a hell.
One said, "They screwed around nobody."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we're telling the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not usual!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have disappointed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were regularly called, for 20 years
Waste and old toys were thrown down on the overwhelming side of the municipal house
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant declined to accept any responsibility for their behavior and for their family, since a delogy is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, since behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have been courageously approaching us and let us get the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and bring the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogy
Workers of the household will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police conducted a razzia in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as waves, paraphernalias and cash amounts of £1.700.
Skeldon received a penalty after she had confessed to the possession of a drug of Class B in the intent of trade.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were decorated with gravfiti.
The police say she'll delegate tenants who don't adhere to the house order.
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police informed that the delogy was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the house order.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without suicide and to those who were damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force Airplane deployed an incredible crash flight
The Air Forces argued that it was on a training flight, but persisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment in which scared tourists begin to get panic after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew nearly in touch over the sun offerers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidays jumped up when they understood that they began to worry about the noise of the dice drives, without first seeing what came through the clouds on them.
The event occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidays who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-by in the social media, said: "It really fled very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were paniced when the plane came out of the darkness and incredibly deep flood
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats outside the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that because of the bad perspective conditions, the Jet was a bit deeper than usual, but the air forces were persisting in the fact that safety was not at any time threatened.
Area burns have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoking - which restricted his viewpoint
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with anxiety against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to the first track win in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the Duell around the Spanish supercup outside against the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must abstain from Neymar in force with the underlying Cupfinalist and the dominant Europe-League Champion, among others, who deal with Brazil with the Olympic Football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
The German suffered in the training of a band dust in the knee, which clarifies the question at least for Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stepen have been contesting for the status as number one for two years in Barcelona.
Coach Luis Enrique abandoned a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the Liga, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first duty game of the new playtime, the Spanish master doubts about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the sample race against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
In turn, Sevilla has the 2:3 defeat after extension in the European supercup against Real Madrid and is seeking the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with eleven successes of the record winners in this application so far.
Ma Long in a own league to Tischtennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis olympiager.
The 27-year-old defeated Zhang Jike 4:0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided finale.
With this, the world-rangelist first picked up the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at WM, World Cup, World-Tour Final Tour and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have done it in the end game as expected and made up the title among each other.
This was clear that for the third time in the sequence, a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the Upper Olympia Trip was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had retired to the tribes and left their protectors alone in fair competition.
"The matches up here I've played for my country."
"I play for myself at the final," said Zhang.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected unilateral.
Mom had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence really.
Then he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang down there only a total of 13 points.
Through the superiority of Ma, the expected match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there was enough breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the game about Bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The White Russian had a rip injury in its quarterfinal against the German European master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, then was in medical treatment, had to be "lasting" with bleek.
Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had also become in the same high table tennis age of Olympia.
Donald Trump admits ′′ violent problems′′ in the election fight
The leadership of the U.S. republics is struggled with massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states.
The presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republic of Highburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the Multimillionary that usually appears great and self-safe expressed such concerns as the correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within its own Republican camp, now the doubts of his success in the fight for the White House grow.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Debt is false reports about his candidate, he re-established his well-known media shells.
Republican Hochburgen wackeln
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor from the democratics, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutes, however, do not look at the distance used to republic candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview by the Sender CNBC, Trump answered the question how he wanted to stop Clinton's premarch again: "Genauso, as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation".
He does nothing but "to tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him at the end for the reasons of political correction, if that is okay, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Party of Trump is supposed to have threatened to strike funds to support its election campaign, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, you want to take the Republicans' candidates for the Congress stronger into the arms.
Olympia: Trist fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a discipline commission in the case.
Kenia's light athletes threaten after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed to set up a disciplinary commission immediately to examine the case.
A Kenyan official had notified that the former Sprinter and today coach, John Anzrah, had delivered a urine test under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.
This has been reported to Kenia's team management by the doping controllers.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information about the case in order to enforce its own investigations, an IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation," said a IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and released himself as Ferguson Rotich, issued and signed the sample," explained Kenias Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become in 2015 in Beijing WM-vierder over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Leathletic Head Michael Rotich had been distracted from the Rio Games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes of the coming doping tests against money payments in his country.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenia has been observed for a long time at the IOC, following a number of doping crimes.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 DOPING target controls in front of the Rio games, it was unusually noted that special athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into vision.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create a anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start.
As a result, WADA Kenia took from the list of countries whose control of doping is consistent with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a large racer nation.
The country's light athletes won most of the medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports repeatedly argued that Kenia's doping means are easily accessible and there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian light athlete.
It was demonstrated that in this type of sports it was fully covered and systematicly baptized.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic pair of love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and satisfied with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra grave the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, directed by the Venezonal Dirigent Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swears.
We always say that it's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scene, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers with grief her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she is extraordinary musical!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and fun and bright."
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such a honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Diriging is a need for him.
You see it in every movement, in your eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as profound today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl, who joined the IS, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, died according to reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family heard of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the bollwerk of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she intended to leave the armed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going to a war area - prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the democratics in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands' confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader of Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dead judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker of Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't make trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the US Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that the Republicans blocked the nomination of Garlands, were Lakais and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate to the President's Office.
Treats want naked calendars for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine cooperates with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970 Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The manager of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his naked magazine differed from Oldschool-Playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
He seems to think that the calendar does.
"We must return to the presentation of timeless and classical nakedness, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body," said Shaw in a press release for the publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality counted with mass flight
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed bags," says the chairman of the Golden-Nearly Foundation Dialog and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality Germany expects in the short term with tens of thousands of seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.
In the meantime, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, chairman of the Association.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the putch attempt, the Kurdish community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"I count with tens of thousands shortly, medium-term with some hundreds of thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and democratic opposition," says the Association Chairman Ali Toprak of the World of Friday.
Because the government had already transferred Kurdish highburgs with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run.
After the degraded putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many people will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state who takes refugees himself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitic cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the excursion pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced over the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the Association asked the Federal Government to "position as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
A "hex hunting" against Erdogan critics also takes place in Germany.
I'm not feeling safe for the last few months in Germany for the first time.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks to abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurden and Oppositionals.
The brand marking as a golden follower destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed bags, also the chemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the golden-near foundation dialogue and education, the "world".
As the newspaper calls on figures from the Federal Ministry of Inner States reports, the Turks before the Putsch presented the largest group of asylum empowered for political persecution in Germany.
At the end of June 30th, these were 11.386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum-justified analyticals (39.625).
This survey does not find the flies before war, poverty, or perspectivelessness.
Asylum rights under the basic law are exclusively political, i.e. by state, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The inhabitants do not get anything from the summer game with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the country day election will not take place again directly at the end of summer holidays, the Swiss Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not going foolisher than so far: summer holidays, heat and country day elections - that bites.
The inhabitants who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation.
Most of the holidays in the country, on usedom, royalty or Hiddensee, are not locals, so must not choose the country day.
There are practical problems: In the holidays helpers are hanging up the plates, blowing up balloons, distributing flyers, and counting out votes only hard to push.
Until September 4, 2016, the election and the last holiday day, Mecklenburg prepommers have to pass nearly by the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Excitingly, how strong newling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition-tracked things.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, head of government, performs a nearly unreasonable campaign of elections, one looks away from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and plucks a little with the people, just as his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soulring has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flourishing of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, her "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Inner Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make elections at the wrong time at the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale environments; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony there as Mecklenburgers and prepommers.
"There was probably the majority from other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely rejects the usual election campaigns on markets and before shopping centres with sunscreens and airballons.
That's what Kokert says, just play a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are breaking away the base on the country, that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You are going like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the wide parts of the country hardly exist.
However, the Council of the CDU Welsh fighter Kokert to his competitors is also self-dispensing: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is at stake, selling has now called on his SPD to a specially engaged election campaign.
In surveys, the social democrats were last with 22 per cent behind the CDU partner (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly with 35.6 per cent before CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should create the jump into the country day.
They make from the holiday note a modern virtue and put their election struggle largely on the Internet.
"Online championship," it calls the country chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters are looking for local voters among the vacators.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is basking with a homeboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and also likes it.
Their impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27 Sanification: Guest places are locked
At the speed with which the B 27 is resettled, there is nothing to mecker.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20 a.m., there is all praise.
"They've made everything pretty sacky," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the Jet tank.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week to the half-time, until the end of October, everything is supposed to be done.
It will also be praised to meet the responsibilities of the construction workers, such as the establishment of assistance entrances.
Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asperg Street in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has also been resistant, the transport situation has relaxed within the place.
Citizens are now able to drive back from the B 27 frequently.
Traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were partly considerable complaints," says Vice-President Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the reconstruction.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sleeves were looking for and more familiar with their navi than with the painting.
As a result, some trucks refrained in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality called on the measuring vehicle from mossing.
"There were considerable crossovers," says King, who once informed himself on site about the situation.
There have been two to three bleeds per minute.
The fastest was on the road with 77 kilometres in the 30-hour zone.
Since the construction site has continued, it has become quieter.
For businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small comfort that the street is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
Looking in the cards can't be like business people.
But that the B 27 sanction has led to sales breakdowns with them, lets everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Whoever has to do with the "detective" less, i.e. produces for other companies, for which the remedy has little consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "most mild decline", but also admits that of course "the run know-how is missing".
The locals are most cultivated along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.
That's already a threat to existence.
Not only he, but all the guest places have hit it "hart".
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The sales rates are "wide over 50 per cent".
The road rehabilitation has thrown its operation back "about two years".
He had to release half his employees.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President-in-Office Jörg Schmidt answered a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the point that the guest place would benefit from the advantages of the B 27.
Günhner knows of other country circles where such a thing was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Günhner is sure that his guest place will continue.
Finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, refers to the long history.
He can understand that the other tribal guests are now less frequently watching through because of the complicated transportation.
If you can't drive, it's nice elsewhere.
The fact that his family clients return after the end of the reconciliation work, there is no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird grips, Günhner has held the impact of B 27 buildings on his know-how for the biggest crisis that has experienced his guest place in their long-term history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly screwed.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All his proposals are "politically evident to the coalition partner", says the Federal Minister of Inner Affairs in the presentation of his new security package.
They're not exaggerating anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also take part in it.
But as an internal minister, he was located at results and at a "reachable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has, after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, left a little while before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
However, they are now far more extensive for this.
Some things are already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Neither the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU data on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière starts a second start for proposals that have not been linked to the SPD: he wants to punish sympathetic heritage for terrorist groups and to kick the German passport with double citizenship.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still believes that this is acceptable and does not demand anything that has no chances for the coalition partner.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have it partly in itself: he plans fast procedures for departures and more possibilities to imprison people before departure.
Refugees who are collected targeted into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and publicised social media accounts for a security verification.
In the case of tolerances for denied asylum applicants, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of them are political and legally hot.
Some are also unfounded and leave questions open.
And at some points - for example, in the case of unequal treatment of duldens - the question is, what does this really have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differ between the topics of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be said that the assaults of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that the people were deeply busy were not even allowed to go out in election times.
Internal security has been immensely focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are election fights.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position in the field of internal security.
In the past days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
Only a twist about the feasibility of the Federal Police, then about a security policy ideas collection of some Union ministers, where the Ressort Chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a decline from the double citizenship.
The Maiziere also strives to reconcile sounds.
He won't keep anything from a departure from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
They're reopening, don't be meaningful.
And at a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is really "necessary" for the coalition partner, it must only appear.
There's a lot of things in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Partie manager Sigmar Gabriel signals carefully and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security."
People's cars are still going through.
Despite diesel scandals, the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
In the call-back operation, there are spines for a term.
Volkswagen starts in the delivery processors in the second half of the year.
Though Europe's largest car builder can continue to show a plus in the past year, despite the diesel affair, thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the total sales, as the company recorded in Dax.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 1,8 percent less vehicles with 449100 cars than in the previous month in July.
In Western Europe alone, after China, the second important market, sales were 14 per cent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany, the supply was cut by almost a sixth.
Head of trade mark Jürgen Stackmann brought the weaker figures from July to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a restraint of purchase through "changed economic frameworks".
In addition to the situation around the putch attempt in Turkey, the British voting also stressed the withdrawal from the EU, explained a speaker.
In the United States, where the exhaust affair first escalated, a minus continues to be booked.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the principally affected home brand of the Niedersachsen is still coming forward by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a minus of 0.9 percent is booked to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue with a sales contribution from January to July.
1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagens in this time, worldwide 5,904 million.
People's cars had manipulated with a software exhaust tests.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars to restructuring the workshops.
As part of the restructuring, VW confirmed that the restructuring of the cars does not have any negative effects.
After the rear-up of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car Builder issues a "safe guarantee" certificate to the customers after reconstruction, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal feasibility.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for re-established diesel models.
This had confirmed last Monday VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport.
It was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the assurance that no worsening occurs after rearrangement in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance and that all type-approval-related vehicle values remain unchanged.
People's car itself does not use the term "guarantie" as it was called in business circles.
In the wide term "guarantie", Volkswagens see the possibility that, for example, customers come to a workshop for half a year after the rearrangement, for example, with a motor damage - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It should also be important for the customer to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, as it stated.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires rich spares in future penalty rates - as a second institution in Germany.
The bank manager Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily accounts."
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banken speaks of a single case and does not see any sign in it: Normal sparers should "not be afraid to pay for their spare gross penalty rate".
Storage Banks Money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee requires the Raiff iron bank Gmund from September from private customers and business customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros since some time, which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not use.
"They are with me on the central bank account and causes 0.4 per cent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't pay for every million of 4000 euros."
The costs are now given on the basis of the principle of contaminants.
The cash just to leave in the tanks of the rail iron bank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four assaults, I don't have the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of installation.
Only a few wandered to other banks.
The Society of Bayern stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry them alone.
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits from three million euros, Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its tax bank branches in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the main business leader of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay surface-decking fees for deposits, so competition in Germany with banks and spare funds is too strong."
A banker said that at Tegern Lake there is "a client that is a little more vulnerable of the property".
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if she guards money free of charge.
Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee, founded in 1911.
In the region, famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Company Association of Bayern "is currently not known any other banks that calculate a deposit replacement for deposits of private customers," said speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken und Raiffeijenbanken (BVR), Uwe Frohlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative to the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the immigration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not fall in the width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Single men of middle age love plates.
Before you rush to the comment part to oversee it under the pseudony NotAll Single MenMediterraneanAlters with raw injuries, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widely discussed resurrection of sound plates is not on a tree in millennials that wishes to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not an ear by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a business street in Soho, a modest gray suit wearing and wildly tailored before I stay, keep my hands and say something definitely like, "So, let's throw a closer look on it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly blows in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were established - there are still a handful of fantastic record special stores.
I'd probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in immediate proximity to different men in such businesses and try to evaluate their age and comfort by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (Data number: two young women, three men of middle age) in the Reckless Records (Data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, do I ask?
"I guess so," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snap shot by email, I did not follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when it appeared and again purchased items he sold when he was young.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meet meet the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media hip, people who have heard about the comeback and have seen their old records again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people have usually solved their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree of adherents to the record revival of a particular age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that plate shops offer a resting community of equality.
According to Wez, some of the older customers were insisting on the contactless payment system.
Some album fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw from the stability of familiar sound plates, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be a filling of empty or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's what I'm as a collector, and I think it's the case with many people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" a worker runs out of a plate pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% had a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate did not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I blew through a bunch of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age), has noted a "tropical aspect" of the revival.
"Somebody just came in here recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put it in the shelf," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-lasting, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
They're younger people, not older people, who're just slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bright audience when I enter.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and women of middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned businesses - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental jazz drowning from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
No one of them looks strangely lonely, but naked psychic traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the varieties of the plates to be sold.
She's making a show window bump rather than a big shop.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of discs is not a real option, she says.
It's a lot of money.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives off with a loved sucker.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of album lovers must have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to have the Jeans Hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley plate player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorative, some are so far above that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plattenkunst".
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most for luxury items such as plates.
Although my research revealed that the results of YouGov were true, they, at least in record shops in Soho, do not consider the large number of female collectors and album lovers that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They will certainly not spend their Thursday tomorrow with the bumping by plate shops of the Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while avoiding the staring view of a terrible, 30-year-old mismoderator who is not raging over the shoulders of men of middle age.
The Greenlandhai is the longest living spinal animal - video report
More scientists say that the greenlandhai has the longest lifespan of all the reels on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examined the Haie, says that the record was with a female who assumes that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court rejects the offer of departure from jungle refugee camps
A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to deprive thousands of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
In a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to cut down 72 provisional transactions in which persons in the camp sold goods from cigarettes to energy drink, sell, offer hairdryer services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be devastated because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid taxes and that would save a risk of fire and sanitation.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the governmentally supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in distress.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for exposing people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely enforceable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the downridge was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, asylum advice for the hundreds of protected, unmarried minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian it said that the closing was "for these children a disaster, of which the latest eight years of age."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a partial increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic Time Travel, cycling professional Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I continue to keep the WM in sight, remain confident and fight on," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelve place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time riding," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons would have led to the Debakel.
At the time ride WM in Katar in October, Martin was actually trying to fight for the title.
"I'm going to look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time world champion who had lost on Wednesday on 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympian Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missed halffinale
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinal of Rio: The World Ranges-32. from Metzingen missed by 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the half-final of the Olympic Tennis tournament.
Siegemund, which was struggled with back problems, could only spend one time and acted powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medal hobning Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance of jumping to the pre-closure round.
The Australian Open Winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas received a medal (Silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters in the quarterfinal of summer games had last been in 1992.
Never had a German duo stood in an Olympic Single Halffinale.
Groups rise at start-up for live video game transfers
Looking at other people playing video games is a giant centre - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up beam specialized on this hobby.
As much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not tell us on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others when playing, but you can intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and put enemies against them and provide equipment.
The player's activity Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of the E-Sport.
On the way to the global media event is intended to help Facebook.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle in the US state of Washington, moves to the Microsoft headquarters of the Californian Redmond, as Beam fellow founder and Chef Matt Salsamndi informed.
For the customers, there is nothing to change by taking over.
Beam is integrated in the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to adjust to the next generation speed measuring: in various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested which are intended to transfer temporarily effectively.
For example, the futurist-effective Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used on accidental issues where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure compliance with speed limitation with a stationary flash there on motorway bridges or to resettle bridges with temporary tempo limits.
However, permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or exhaustive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days on uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data will be transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, laser measuring technology allows all vehicles to be recorded over several traces at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as cross-border bans by time, drives and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-fixed state, you can move the trailer according to manufacturers with each car with attaching circuit.
In order to not simply be stealed, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so the wheels disappear in the panished and also shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from Vandalism.
Since 2015 the trailer has been tested and now used in various federal countries according to Vitronic’s data.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in the 7-er Rugby, after Fiji's Masterclass Gold
The impressive performance of the UK at the 7-Rigby came at the final on Thursday evening to a sudden stop at the last barrier in the form of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji delivered a master class in action, side-stepping, backwards, line run and raw force to win gold - their first olympia medal of any color.
The defeat was cut by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament where they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them at the finale.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in best shape in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji's Chief Trainer Ben Ryan, former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind itself.
Eight years ago they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This sleeve will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs come out of goodness.
It felt like the Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With four more minutes of play time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A fantastic coat of Mitchell stopped the Mount of Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the reappearance and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached by another weak cracking of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns about it.
That's what it is.
GB made fundamental changes to half-time and closed the Fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been a long time in favour of the South Sea Insulana, whose fans sang, swooped flags and danced on the Tribüne.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-top with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The Pfiff sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked destroyingly hit into the grass.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a hard half-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for ruder victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that wants to mean something.
From the first robbery to the last, 220 hard hieve, who enters history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who sat on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was widespread when they ran to the second Olympiagold in the two without a taxmaid, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, anyway, the 39th unplugged operation, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that glide over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which does not reflect the type of triumph to gons.
Behind every gold in the rods, a bataillon stands on willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that constitutes the difference and there was no one helper than the trainer who didn't know if he would survive this day at all 30 months ago than it was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bubble cancer, which is operational and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption at a minimum if that under such circumstances is at all the right concept.
I needed money, so I soon had to get better.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Roading on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even greater.
In the immediate victory, their first thoughts of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than anything else, trying to cope with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the chief of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was a emotional wreck this week. This may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thanks to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn't hold with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to capture, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "be in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get rid of yourself.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for doing something great.
We did not want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a delay for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I am an olympian.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years exemplary for clarity
The director of the Water Purpose Association "Vietenstein Gruppe", Ruppert Göller, goes to retirement.
The association is deemed to be "predominant throughout bayers".
A smaller drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This was said in the original sound some time ago in a contribution from the Bayerian radio.
Shortly later, the water forum of the government of subcontractors deserved the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was "bearers all over" as an example.
After all, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose association, stands 28 years as manager.
Now he was adopted in retirement at 65 years of age.
The drinking water supply association of the Veitenstein group with its seat in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and lots with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Broitbrunn's mayor, Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed as a waterwave in 1985 and was appointed as the manager of the purpose association in 1988.
"Their tasks have been very diversified, and they have stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budgetary establishment, calculating fees and contributions to emergency actions at weekends," said the chairman.
As an outstanding event, it called the launch and dedication of the new sources (1994), land sales in the field of new springs (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the recovery of the high containers (1999), the re-opening of a central computer control (2004) and the diversification of water pipelines.
There has been no stopping, and there have always been renewals, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has spent a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association, as if it was his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the vegetarian stone group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district underfresh.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller on his side praised Alfons Grebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water guard and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were an invisible team.
As peaks from his viewpoint, he described the well-building and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the rupture of pipes at the high container at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night through so that the villages could be provided with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn has once been maintained because you filled the high container from Pettstadt with snakes.
The management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who enters the success of Rupert Göller.
Sopranistin Anna Netrebko is dealing openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed she had to die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has progressed well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that is two years behind when I sang at the mailer Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relation State in Barthete - Man shoots on a partner of life
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10:45 p.m. in a multi-family house in Barteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and hurt her deadly.
"The man even called us and stated that he shot his lifemate," said a police speaker.
The transgressor shall be on the escape, after him will be caught publicly.
Nowadays, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters tall, musculoskeletal, brown fire and has a glass.
Now the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a glass.
I don't want to speak to the man directly.
He could still wear the gun, says the police.
If you see Sven S, you'll call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relation state".
The victim is the year of 1988, the perpetrator of 1981.
At first, the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make information about the tathergang or the relationship between the victims, but she confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing. "
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-based and energy-intensive German steel industry remains protected from additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from eco-stream support are from the table.
It remains in the release from the renewable energy environment in the stock plants for so-called self-stream production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Ministry Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Westdeutschen Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Freitagausgabe).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this tough negotiations after two years."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask steel producers to use the gases from the high oven for electricity production for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs from EUR 120 to 240 million per year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC turnover of 20 per cent falls.
But they are not also raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on self-stream production.
In this way, the status quo of the current regulation is largely defined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is particularly important.
"For our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Apart from the reform of emission rights trade, climate and employment objectives must be considered," explained IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen when the world's largest producer country China was thrown massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers propose Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties due to imports of steel effect, on the other, economic prospects in China have increased.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, prices would have been more stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not even want to exclude closings of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were busy at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced at 3.4 million tons at least six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the economic association informed steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the manufactured quantity now went back the second month afterwards.
Since the beginning of the year, production is by two percent below the previous year.
The association is expected in the next few months, thanks to an improved position of order with an increasing emission.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing makes Seniors good
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school chore, in the school office study she worked with music, and today the 78-year-old singing in a senior chor.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
Besides, she does something good in her health and spirit.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorliga.
Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
The regular union allows senior social contacts to be linked and maintained.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Take up and organise, be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - one choir is a very special form of union."
Sing can be hard in a positive sense, says Hackler.
For thereby seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly demand your lungs, you don't even get out of the breath in your everyday life.
Even if it is about receiving the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explained.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or hearing songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with the positive feelings of their youth.
By lyrics and particularly melodies, self-depressed people are deprived of long-term events.
When singing, the head is also demanded a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-respect also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing, there's enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes down?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circuit sings in a senior chor, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the chore in the area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can directly contact the municipality or the church leader.
Many older men can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, Hackler advises.
Sing the soul does good and has something relief - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to the screaming of the young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cat babys on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Miauen did not let the males cold, but they always acted the same as the females.
Female cats can detect the excitement rate of cat babys at the miauen of the little ones.
They respond about ten percent faster to sounds of cats who are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) found out.
Cater also responds to the call of cats - but always the same.
"Certainly the acoustic differences between the miau of less and strongly established young animals for the males are either not perceiveable or not important," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology magazine.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already discovered that the duration and tone height of the cats scream varied from the urgentness of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the animal maintenance of the MHH.
They were used as a call of young people who were taken out of the garbage box for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
Secondly, they were confronted with screaming from stronger-resistant cats, which were additionally raised.
In spite of the small sample, researchers consider their results significant.
"All females, even those who have not had their own descendants, reacted differently to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call played the more resurrected cats.
This ability may be inherited or develop with sexual maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have examined the responses of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski takes with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sukur is a football camp in Turkey.
In Turkey, a arrest order has been adopted against the single football star Hakan Sükur.
He is convicted to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the pussy attempt, a major football game will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the erzrivals between Beblickas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is indicated.
Already when the exemption was suspended after the reconciliation attempt in July, the government did not want to affect normal citizens' everyday life.
However, this does not apply to those suspected, belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah golden, which is responsible for the pussy test.
It does not stop before the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükur, the prosecutor issued a arrest order.
Thus, the Southern Southern, living in America, is now convicted to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sukur is supposed to be the attendant of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, responsible for the putch test by the President of the State Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exception, firstly, applies for 90 days until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The night's "democracy wakes" on public places throughout the country, Erdogan declared closed on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into attendants and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the worker club Besiktas are traditionally not among the friends of the president.
However, the large number of Turks, in view of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military pumps.
There are even the fans agreed - no matter whether their hearts beat Galatasaray or viewas.
In Pokalsieger "Gala" it will come back to Luke Podolski.
His sports value proved to the Cologne in the past season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he reached the 1:0 winner.
The newspaper "Fanatic" rejoiced him: "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an outstanding way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciliable conclusion.
After the Champions League, the "Lews" were excreted early in the Europe League.
In the Super Lig it was only rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"We did that, and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
The game year was better for Master Vissiktas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who placed the base on the 14th title with 26 seasons as Süper-Lig-Torn-König.
This is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In this context, the Gomez, who was only borrowed in the AC Florence, had announced that he had not returned after his EM holiday because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," quoted the professional magazine "Kicker" Club Manager Fikret Orman.
However, the storm must be ready to refrain from about a third of its estimated 7,5 million euros, Orman made clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin had already been locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other transmitted light athlete singers can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The topic Doping continues to determine the headlines of the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had accused her right to start after a doping lock just before the games, was graciously ejected and expanded at her start (100 metres) breast.
It offered a cruel scene: With a smile set up, she was still stolen into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was found that she wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out in a joyous storm.
However, there are many more athletes who, despite doping past, start at the Olympics in Rio.
Here's a summary:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athlete.
He had already been locked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympian of 2004 and the Ex-World Champion is even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered to be the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-staffel/Jamaica): The two-time olympia and seven-fold world champion had to sit a six-month block after she had been proven to take the painful agent oxycodon in 2010.
She had severe dental pain after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatians): 2011 the Olympiasian of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016, was tested positively on the prohibited stimulant mid-hexanamine.
Perkovic contradicts the conscious intake and was locked six months.
The four largest throws in this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): The Peking Olympics and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and 21 months were blocked.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt controlled.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Nearly a athlete was re-recognised by so many medals.
Thus Tichon lost his 2005 WM title nine years later after his testosteron doping was detected.
In 2004, the 40-year-old had to give off Olympia Silver for steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 for testosteron misuses.
He also received the Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80,04 m, it is located on rank two of the world rank list.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world recorder and gold favoritine were only tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a prohibited food supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and ran off on 13 July.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - More dead
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She has suffered cuts and has been treated in the hospital, but it has already been able to leave this again.
Her home trip was planned for early September.
Whether the further explosions on the Phuket island of holidays and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, says Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers south of Bangkok capital, was first exploded on Thursday evening in a district of explosion.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosions went up again, and, according to the authorities, another man was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.
At the detonation near the vacation beach Patong was injured by a taxi driver according to police statements.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded to kill a urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive rate was aired in a flower bed before the coastal police department.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast were demanding several injuries.
You go out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bomb attacks carry the same manuscript," said Armeeeigeneral Danai Kritmethaveee Friday breakfast before journalists.
"We assume it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express itself on possible motives - but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebells.
Thailand media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic resurrection movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it was assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In the past days, the authorities had received secret information on future attacks in the southern part of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
Be unclear what group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are constantly smaller bomb attacks, but they are usually not opposed to tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on its homepage recommends that the instructions of the Thai Security Authority be followed.
High safety risk (Security Level 3) was valid for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and the environment.
Following conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary trips to these provinces are advised.
Increased safety risk (Security Level 2) was valid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution developed by the military junta.
It also gives great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country moves towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power after a phase of bloody disturbance in 2014, will benefit itself from returning the Kingdom to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the outer south for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people had been killed in an attack on a popular Hindu stage - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitary Movement" has been taken into the vision of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the Constitutional Protectors have also placed the group under observation.
"We see at the 'Identitary Movement' points for pursuits against the freedom of democratic rule," said Constitutional Protection Manager Hans-Georg Masses of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamed extremely.
That is why we now observe the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "the loss of its own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thüringen - already observe the "identities".
Maaten said that his authority was closely aligned with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitary Movement' are trying to get their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Protection Manager.
Generally, extremists try to speak them with youth-right language, often with poppy music.
This was done by Islamists as well as legal extremists.
This is not a proper advertising for your own thing.
The propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports from several federal countries on contacts between "Identitaries" and AfD politicians.
Masses said he had no knowledge of it.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this type are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes their target direction by certain extremes and becomes so extreme.
Therefore, it is crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is unrecognised.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum applicants and refugee accommodations, measures said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the 'Old School Society' group or the Freetaler Group.
It may be that further legal terrorist groups or minor groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motives.
However, a German or Europe-wide governance of legal terrorism is unrecognised.
The previous groups were created at regional or social level.
Anxiously, measures expressed that many assaults went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects of attacks on asylum housing had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or adherents to the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to hate before with legal extremists, which may have been politically different, or have elected, for example CDU, SPD or left, but which have radiated themselves by right-extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet heat
Not always determine the olympics or world records the headlines of the Olympics.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Have at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming from Ethiopia was swimming so slowly that it was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte became a viral Internet heat.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended with a remnant of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 launchers.
It was, however, his not just sporting figure, which took the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was given a special start-up right from the international pool association.
This is distributed to make swimming more public in underrepresentated countries.
Since most athletes run in ethopia, had just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Hatte is ready for the great race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel of the Whale".
The English boulevard magazine "The Sun" with "Pad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he hit only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
In the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's run provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter alone in a precursor over 100 meters of free style.
Freneticly Moussambani was then fired.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at the new place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old warrior left her business on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8:15 a.m., about 250 euros were disappeared from the box.
Could not find traces of the transgressor.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the threatening election defeat so tight
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks on an electoral event in Florida.
If it's not going to be the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's driving on the vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively no matter for him: "The latter will either work, or I have a very beautiful, long vacation," said the candidate of the Republican in a telephone interview with the US TV transmitter CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for the reasons of political correction, be all right, said Trump.
Thus he called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State of Terror Miliz (IS).
Within his party, more and more resistance became the last.
Post increases in trading with electric transporters
An electrical additive of the German Post in operation.
The interest of other companies in the danger seems to be great.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
Soon the group wants to start trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from the next year on the free car market.
"We want to go into sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is to sell its own developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages to other companies.
Post board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, such as from craftsmen.
After information from the news magazine "The mirror" the Bonner Group will soon join the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a long-term complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active in Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership defers after disappointing business numbers
The GfK Consumer Research Company exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The withdrawals came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of Head of Director Matthias Hartmann becomes so uncertain that the longer the success he promised remains.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberg market research company GfK: After re-disappointing business numbers and the withdrawal of business management, the world number Five of the industry stands before a personal restart.
GfK Board Chef wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already separated from the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
The Governing Board has already taken over the former Governing Board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, the company informed.
He should officially take over the function of a "president speaker" until a follower was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company referred to "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details were not intended to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Those who are to lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the shareholders were ultimately disappointed about the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK top since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not seen even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business numbers, each shareholder becomes at some point disturbed.
"If this was the case with BMW, it would also make the quants like that," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its losses even in the second quarter of 2016 after relapse in the prequartals.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was by 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable previous quarter.
As regards the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter has particularly stressed the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company value depreciation of EUR 139 million was required in the Consumer Experience business area to the Group under the strike a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had acquired a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus out in crown horns in graves: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people have been injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Ironach had to avoid her information as a result of a meeting load that partly drove on the countercar.
The bus came right from the street and walked into a grave, as reported by a police spokesman of Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the situation of the bus, the people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire force liberated the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a emergency car arrived at the accident site on the country road 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The detectors asked the carrier and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the range of wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro (early 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (early 2.18 Euro).
The installation in Azendorf will increase the wastewater fee at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the Council of Landmbach found that undercovers for these wastewater plants were found in the approval of the budget.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the installations costly on the basis of legal basis.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens and industry companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the money bag.
The fees increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As director Herbert Schmidt gave up to the body, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers were also compensated from the previous calculation period.
The gravitating fees increases found Schmidt that all three wastewater plants deal with relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, the cost of the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, wastewater income in all three plants is slightly declining.
In addition, in the relapseing calculation period, all three installations had not at least a significant impact on their age of recovery and repair expenses.
The installation in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the installations for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the wastewater plant Azendorf due to damage.
In the pump plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old funding plants had to be overwhelmed from ground and at the laundry clarification system Lopp had to run out the first clarifying deck after almost 20 years, dispose of the clothing mud and a additional ventilation possibility to be built in order to comply with the water laws in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses resulted in the requisite maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhausen made it clear that in the low wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are "fullly covered".
In this context, supplemented Schmidt, the market community has remained safe for large entertainment costs in the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants is still to be preserved in the view of stone houses, since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association cannot be extended to these installations because it is a deficit.
Bulgaria is booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (from June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, as positive 0.2%.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); different goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household equipment and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anim-inspired, but some observers say it is insensible to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million users daily to change the reality and to play with identitys in such a way that already limits to the absurd.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unprecedented, disturbing tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past drawn criticism in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote more or white skin as beauty sideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slims, false teeth and impressed wings, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelb face".
They were wondering whether these repeated controversies showed a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the annoyment were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it had disabled the feature.
The company apologized: The filter was intended as a homage to anime charts and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injuring clichés.
Others deliberately rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Savepani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweets were widely distributed about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and gentlely said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contradiction of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face was drawn into the devaluering extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are in matters of race more than their older counterparts - could rather assume that they expect awareness.
If one of Snapchat filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "this is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In a media set and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended with a hash day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Anyway, it has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their occupation, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or well to say something about it."
Others share their views, a complaint that has mostly left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday it refused Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but, according to one speaker, the company recently set up a personnel responsible, focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on the other hand, said that she would let her Snapchat account close and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not OK."
Military management misleads ISIS Secret Service Information, the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command altered information on security to draw a optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when it had allowed the actual conditions on the site, an investigative committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, drawn up by a task force of the Republican members of the Army Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Response Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analytists who reported how directors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News Service Information, which was typically abandoned by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drawn a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the site and were more consistently positive than analysis of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.
"What happened to Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republic member of the Representative House, noted.
The leading errors in the Centcom range up to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed permanent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi army.
Although there is no direct indication that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analytists were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before the convention were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts," the report stated.
For example, a centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congress delegate from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the newspaper reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analytists were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are ongoing by the Secretary-General of Defence.
On Thursday, democratic members of the News Services Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created a excessively restricted process for the creation of security assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democracy in the committee, member of the Adam B. Ship Representative House, in an opinion.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of postal reports," damaged the morality among analytists and "made excessively little space for different opinions."
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats stated that there were no evidence of the White House's intervention at the Centcom Analytics regarding a "defined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which was initiated after complaints by Centcom Analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on reports from the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in progress.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have very diversified opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the news services and the Defence Ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have an impact on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by an increasing number of members of the Defence Ministry).
However, the accusations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds the disputes of more than ten years ago than a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote about how the then government under George W. Bush, in contrast with the recommendations of many analysts, planned only a small crew in Iraq and took little time to consider the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team around Mr Hooker, according to government offices, found that against the statements of the Government Airschlags against the refineries held by the Islamic State, no significant impact on the financial situation of the Terrorist Group, since these provisional refineries had taken place to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reports the Times in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war strikes at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain is ahead
One day after she shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember what has ever been done.
"I don't know." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.
But that is what she knows: The American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic Battle and are just in their group with the British at the first place, which remains unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet together on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinal, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will gain the first and second place.
The first placed one will take the strong Dutch women a little longer away from the way that the other group leads.
Whatever the game ends on Saturday, the American women have caused a surprising spine through their success story, four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first with three years she had a hockey hit in hands (their two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became a national player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the box.
Then the year 2012 came where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work course in London that we have now.
We have been able to crawl the rod completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a relapse from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself astonishingly and kept the play stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in her hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and kicked the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2-0 leadership.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of all the tournament for the United States' gatekeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the cen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast track between competition and pursuits.
It's like the Olympic Fackel itself was a burning stab that is given from the armburst shooter to swim to the tower to triathlet.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time in the Olympic Games and is a female sword with graves, could have been quite under these famous names sent to the Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-feeling TV advertising if he was a swimmer, tower or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolin Tours.
The Olympic Flame does not light any event equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports types that are not generally recognized: air guns, archers, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I should humbly make arguments for my favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been seen so locked over the last 16 years that many of those I had been inquired didn't know that it was an olympia sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had a athlete that has made it until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outer side charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthly enthusiasm.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartony trembling of its never to end in a mislead - but also the graces of turning and diving, the two sports types that mainly unite it.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Springboard."
Strong winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have to have a number of falling movements (twisting, hooking and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to official Olympia programmes following execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will join each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is straight out.
Medal hopers must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and up, up and down on the playground.
They are not only chasing the target line or the starting wall, but also in the television transmission a further chicken goal: the world or the Olympia record.
The targeted pursuit is novel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to touch even a viewer to tears.
But it is also what I feel a little tired when I look at these games.
Of that, the trampoline offers an atmosphere.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the target.
He or she screams off, seems hard to be like an astronaut, goes upward, then down, then without effort back up.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant withdrawal of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifications and end rounds will take place on Friday afternoon at Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will radiate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tomult.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the accumulation and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tourners recently suggested by The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community ringing to air.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a allyte of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants who demand political changes in Ethiopia are encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the conflicts with the police in case of shooting change.
Is Ethiopia just breaking together?
In the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid alliance of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months protests against the government shocked the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unbarmhurtig.
Witnesses argued that policemen shot and killed on zig unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests that are likely from the last or the beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with stokes while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the UN human rights consultant now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populated country of Africa to Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist risks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded considerably.
Its infrastructure has improved drasticly - there is a new Pendler Travel in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led to the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted and dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the wides of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
One generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to root grip with regard to the power of the rulership coalition.
After a largely criticised election last year, the government party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this cracky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytists fear that separaters such as the Oromo Release Front or the National Release Front of the Ogad, which has been more or less distressed over the past few years, can benefit from turbulencies and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness now explode after the years of the past bacon under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones became more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxys that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the oromas and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Eyes, the Amharas, who are mainly from Ethiopia, have prospered in politics and economy, while exploiting the oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But it's just changing.
"We are in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tigray, who are about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the disturbance is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years before his death at an unpublicated disease in 2012 for an Ethiopian Prime Minister.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analytics say that he was particularly versatile in observing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to handle opponents and to make them harmless.
"The current regime is lacking of this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North-Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which seemed to have been suspended and then stolen by the government, according to analytics.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last few months and this time of disturbance passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendant train, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal miswilling of the Ethiopian government.
And she adopts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked businesses conducted by Tigray in Gondar, an amharic city, and hatred against the tigray becomes more and more common in social media.
Analytics say that protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the base for drones flights over the neighbouring Somalia, even if she recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin crying."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to distort the last controversy that surrounds his campaign, indicating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been seriously mentioned by the "founders" of the Islamic State Terror Group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate with the American public.
It also brings his competitors, who strive to protect him during an eventual phase, into the own position to have to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the expression at a election campaign event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rejected the claim on Thursday and invited in interviews that he did not really declare that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day at which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama ISIS wanted to destroy, the Republican Presidency candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism triggers Mr. Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign for falling survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held talks about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he took strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I meant this sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then back to the need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "explain" depending on the way the reaction occurs." Ruth Sherman said, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vage enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of exposing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted a more educated sound, as his survey values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a great lead in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is in focus in the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provokant his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps' most prominent speakers, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I think what he said is legitimate, political comments," so Mr. Giuliani said, he was questioned about Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was a nearly unknown, small organization, he called them back benchlers, perfectly wrong and therefore happened because he departed the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republics are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by preventing aggressive control of the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and instructed them to be confronted with each of his words.
He screwed the "arm, painful" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democratics spotted Mr. Trump's apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate to the President's Office.
Once dispersed from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a tremendous café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay a bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of its Bedford Avenue Laden front.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Inhabitants betrayed it as the last loss in a genetic city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's change, it's also new invention.
A relived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one miles north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing worker of the old café, who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outside office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food map, sandwiches with specc and cheese and there are garnations such as caps and soured onions.
There are natural travel keys.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a constant stream of old ancestors.
"Many old customers were also pushed out of Williamsburg by prices," he said.
On one Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer of this kind.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way to herself.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees this day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and ordered inevitably the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they prepare my every-thing bucket with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his ordinary order, but sometimes he switches his Everything-Bagel with specc, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he was not grieving that the soap business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-breaked coffee of the coffee as ingredient.
"I think we're still going to respond to their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to post them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further benefits.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a ancestor and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entry of the local and the orders felt a new coffee like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a facility for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato pepper and as a dessert a plow pudding.
"It was a act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while the tegelman in their book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publisher on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbis in the Flatiron district, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Tegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato pear and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this was appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," said Tegelman.
There were peanut bread, liver jaw and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine to eat so many peasant nuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe laughs.
"It must have been laying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Women's crew cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways that the country was dealing with not being the scaraffe land anymore.
"It was a time when food became a central, exciting topic for the Americans," said Coe, "why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was stressed: Secrety foods such as bread and cash rolls were made for basic nutrients to re-use the cash roll as "wonderful kind, food rests," pointed out, since cooks could hide inappropriate ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Special mixtures were tested, since a calories-rich and nutrient satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, bricksman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with earthnuts butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the noon," said Coe.
Tegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Petroleum butter and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household receptions.
Like never before or since, household operators - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drew the eating habits of the country like that.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "house politicians" and the challenge of transforming pamps like cream spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historic delicious bites.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Meich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are shameful.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he was eating like the millions of heavy man of the world to which he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurkensauce," said Coe.
He ate in a nearly golden food room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderful reality stranger.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not invited him to statue a example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in taste directions by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortless preparations."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs.
The emergence lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Tegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When the couple wrote the book, they had better understanding the eating habits of Tegelman's mother-in-law - for example how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Tegelman remembered, "She really made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates had been removed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe developed a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plowing seat that President Roosevelt at lunch ate.
"It is called Prue Whip," said Tegelman, adding that it was a usual trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There were no strokes, only flours, some flour, sugar, water and cimt.
Everyone was deliberately diveing in a leaf in the brown gllibber.
Amazingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe picked up a look three times.
Like a Can-Do-Budgetier, he said to his wife, "A few hacked walnuts would help."
Killed at bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old even died in a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the image-time, has saved almost 600,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first help in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protector showing him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a glorious symbol in the grey of the war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said, "For me this is the real Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself attacked the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four feather bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with Chlorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now eliminate the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest spinal animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swimming with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic to this day.
Greenland sharks only receive 150 years of growing.
The greenlandhai swimming along the grounds of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it will be around 1,220 meters in an average.
Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates on set 2.6 km/h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a robe.
This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent concept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the Scientific journal of a Greenlandhai that could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this lifespan, which means a world record for spinal animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that greenland sharks are going to age stones.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the emperor of the thin inhabited coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees of Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of the greenland sharks.
Their time lupent rate was measured when they provided six animals with a transmitter in front of the top mountains.
Yet bread do these sharks: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the jaw of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the eismer and look for cadaver, which turns down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 greenland sharks, which took fishermen from 2010 to 2013 from Greenland or Spitzbergen as an advocate from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 cm was measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon 14-methode of the shark's lens core.
This center of eye lense is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had outstandingly much carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts drew larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the third smallest animal length of 220 cm, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
On the other hand, all larger greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantity in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 hour for a 493 cm long greenlandhai showed a age of 335 years, while the record-hai with 502 cm was expected to be 392 years old.
The fact that greenlandhai females will not have grown until they are more than four meters, was known.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold for gender maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, greenland sharks are evidently allowed to grow at least one and a half centuries.
This also seems to be the world record for spinal animals at present.
The fact that such methusalems live mainly in iron waters is not a coincidence.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenlandwal, in whose spectacle stood at the neck a 120-year-old harpun tip, was captured in front of Alaska.
The low temperatures often also lead to the organism of the animals living there to spare flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often grow especially.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal carries heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than by a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible," explains the evolution biologist Schuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources rather in a long life.
Building background in double pack
Topics around construction have been discussed by the municipality in the recent session.
With facilitation, the body noted the communication of Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the newly established housing areas can eventually begin".
After the land, parcelling and deployment issues were clarified and the applications for measurement were made, the sale of lands in the residential areas of Strassweg and Schönau-West (Region Binderstraße – Extended Section 1) is no longer in the way to stakeholders.
The municipality is convinced that the construction sites in the countryly and quiet dwelling community Schönau also respond to young families and comfortable seniors.
As it stated, builders can immediately report to the Council House, the parcels are expected to be awarded in its September session.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of further businesses, linked to the creation of jobs, the municipality decided to amend the area-use plan that was created in sub-sectors only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the subtime-larn area, the already designated commercial area is expanded by two parcels in the direction of State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main thus has the best chances in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract jobs and companies moved from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigland, head of the field of competence financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial businesses throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have yet to be authorised in Great Britain.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced shifting jobs.
The Frankfurt Main Finance Lobby Association expects 10000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the European Central Bank (ECB), the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The nearness to the Notenbank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg has a large funding industry, but it has also cut off Dublin's infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach, thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easy-to-available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigland.
In addition, the rents for first-class commercial property are 50 percent higher than at Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical supply and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's Corporate Advisory Board, the city is on the seventh place, Luxembourg on 19th place, Dublin on place 33 and Paris on 37th place.
Even if life quality is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial position for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," follows the IW.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
For this, the power conditions are: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, about 144000 people in the banking industry, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimburse the legal costs created by the Hepatitis C dispute with the Merck & Co Inc Pharmaceutical Company.
In June, Gilead was freed from an injury payment of $200 million for the injury of two patents from Merck, which were associated with the Sovaldi and Harvoni Blockbuster medicines of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior since Mercks, including the Minide and other unethical acts.
When the complaint was brought up on Thursday, US Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to adopt the costs arising during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to be like Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case depends on the year 2013 when Gilead and Merck accused each other and took advantage of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S. supported troops say that they reigned full control over Manbi from the Islamic State
U.S. supported troops have taken full control over the northern city of Manbi back near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters left them in the city, a speaker of the group said on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) come through the city now after the excavation of the remaining group of fighters buried within the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish informed Reuters of the Manbij Military Council associated with the DC.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just carrying out cleaning work," he said Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015, which gave the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for well-acting purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in speaking honours; the former foreign minister gave a income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her office time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements in the last ten years with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast to that, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retractors with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obliged to do so because of law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers stated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, as regards the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Adviser, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are not completed.
Trumps critics, including the Republican Presidency candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal has raised questions regarding assets, its donations for well-acting organisations, its business gestures and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, where high-range Republican Trump calls on to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax declarations." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that in the 1990s, Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and one economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who stated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the electoral campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that persons who earn over USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has its seat, to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an IRS tax review and Trump had "angst" for the voters and not for the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax declarations until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an averagely effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Declaration showed that it was only USD 100 of their income as a wage, different from the majority of all Americans.
Their main fund was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and yields of USD 109.000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks bodies promote danceanias elephant protection
Natural Protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into people's inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honey Guide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in the northern Tanzanias to use a violent four-level approach to protect their homes and harvest without injuring animals.
Many spears used before to defend themselves.
Friday is the world elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we developed this ... Toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, which are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the manager of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a flash and the blowing in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with Earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, whose end is turned to the condensation.
When it gets burned, the condom places up with a knack and sprays fine dust on chilipuder in the air.
A hook, usually, already out to chase the elephants.
One last option represents a warper who shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No Kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goarer's investment projects by traders with kisshand are considered to be significantly expansionable for retail trade in the city.
However, the request for a reconstruction of a sales kiosk at the Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony located in the building was now unanimously rejected by the City Council.
"In principle we welcome new commercial operators, but at this location in exposed position on the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jüdische Regisseur defeated Berlin's hotel because Israeli pre-selection was removed after "arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots defeated a media rebellion after he had told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli choice, since it had Arab guests, according to a employee, "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country selection list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via a own call center.
After an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it provoked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre-selection be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handler called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were disturbed and disturbed by this event.
That's really disgraceful.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is even more shameful.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty great resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole a scandal.
Some underlined Kempinski Hotel that it had "released" the claimed demands of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it was said in another contribution, pointing out that the hotel located on the noblish curvature dam is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations from itself and called the incident an "invisible" and "forgive" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country selection has now been added.
Police uses tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officials tried to break the students apart, resulting in the use of rubber shots and tear gas by the police.
Several hundreds of students participated in the demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen grave fitits sprinkle against the preliminary president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from the office by a voting of the Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the repayment of sanctions grew by 70,9 percent in the annual comparison.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been repealed, the interests of Russian companies in businesses in the country have grown strongly, the ambassadors informed.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the most important priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $866 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassadors.
Dzhagaryan is a record of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, mainly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something of which the Ambassador hopes it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: Drinking market in forest brills
A robbery has been carried out on the drink market of Rewe XXL on the Gerberstraße forestry.
Under the preservation of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had seized their faces demanded the release of cash from the hire of the drink market and then flew at foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW-golf.
How much money was spent, the police don't inform.
The transgressors were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, i.e. relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible and badly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
After the assault, the killers must run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flee from the parking parking parking with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (ladring).
Those who made observations related to the robbery at the time of action (at 19.45 p.m.) should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and joyful days the children and adolescents spent in the social pedagogical group/social group work of the Nagol child protection association with their maintainers at their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located recreational home Hardtwaldle, the lively group was investigated during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with a visit to the Streichelzoo.
Secondly, to Munbronn, where there was a special childbearing in the world - famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celten Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the everyday life and the food of the Keltes.
In the hot days, the group at the Deep Lake enjoyed pleasure in Munbronn, which invited to jump, swim and planks.
culinary children and maintainers with their self-prepared irons such as the acids late, the sea bronner pfanne, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman-Mühle game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun and the children and youths were happy to return home.
Hair hole: Pilgrims for the Pforte of Mercy
The ministers from the seal care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were traveling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to overcome the time to the next Rome Wall trip of all ministers in expected two years, the Chief Ministerial Round, St. Anna, has decided to prepare and carry out a multiday pilgrimage.
Several wall travel goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop city of Freiburg, where this year, in the context of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening pforts of mercy at the Freiburger Münster, a special pilgrimage was offered.
16 Minis of bitter sources, gruol, hayer hole, and saint rooms made themselves on the way.
On the evening before, Pfarrer big-east sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and delivered the pilgrimages.
From Horb, on a railway to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster of Our Dear Woman stands and thus the Pilger Road was entranced by the Münster.
The daily tours were embraced by a short impulse every morning and evening with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis of field crosses, chapels, or churches constantly rushed to sing together a song from a specially compiled Pilger songbook.
The nights were available for parishes of local parishes each.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
Furtwangen went to Gütenbach on the second day.
On the next day, the phase of St. Peter, which was the most arrogant route, had to go down about 500 feet [500 m] and then be climbed again.
The earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathtub in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilger Day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
The Minis came to the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and walked through the pounds of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis of Cooperator Markus Obert, which arrived at the Pilger Destination, were welcomed.
After the service of God, the Pilgrimages were able to see the Sakristei and the High Altar.
The next day was still time for the breisgaumetropol.
Afternoon it went back to Horb by railway.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British Gold rings for cycling sports
Schottlands Callum Skinner rested last night at the male team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to the glory when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll that his landlord Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The boys pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to inherit a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympiagold medals.
They repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place at the London Railway Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the advocate Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as obstacles appeared.
Hoy's retirement caused a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the scotch that has now emerged.
Hinds, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympia record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the dual with gold.
After his round, it was just back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategic change was a large part of the transformation, where Hinds drove in a higher course to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out from his position as BBC experts and fell up Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the pods.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up an Olympia record in the end and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the Kennys and Hoys page, Hinds admitted that he deliberately fell on the railway after a weak start.
He withdrawn this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivalries.
In such a surprising victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hind said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We have lost so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympic Piade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has been won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys, it is possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic Gold Medals in a competition.
This would mean a expense of six gold medals and a silver medal on March 23, for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, which was also born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born).
That would be the one from Hoy.
The next time Kenny participates in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hind said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51.942.
The world record won in London Gold in 2012 was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be in focus with certainty.
He had struggled with officers before qualification yesterday when officials called to him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record time in 4:13.260.
The GB team relys on its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a lot of medals.
After an unusual representation of absolute domination in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were declined.
The dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and mobbing propositions, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first night of competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary call of GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's smelting due to the abolition of the energy contract questioned
The future of the Aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator is terminating the energy supply contract and will thus terminate all supply contracts, as the supplying energy companies informed.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidie will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closing.
In addition, Domino effects could be achieved as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a close of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa smelting in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation of the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminium meltery with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, informed that it is expected that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is largely owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company informed.
AGL continued to say that the Treaties were so-called "security businesses" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will end in 2017.
"The AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue during the 17th financial year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong deadlines for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL informed that it has already deprecated the value of the contracts in its annual account of $187 million in "expectation of a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate melting or to ensure electricity supply to the melting industry" does not affect.
The U.S. Company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it was still guilty of a declaration why it has retired from the Treaty.
Analytics warn because of the poor economic conditions of the industry against the possible closure of Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the analytical statements at the beginning of the week, head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 Megawatt and Tomago around 900 megawatt on electricity annually.
If both installations disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [stream market].
And that wouldn't be good for us as a power producer," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I loved brought me the sight of this covers to cry," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), written reality video, which shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they forget the cover of their sister and end with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the climbing act nearly every birthday stage of a child's mission (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a sign caniny at a station at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to hit her with the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were looking for it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a range that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertising operators (as stated in fashionista, the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages were advertising).
The discovery of his cover star is so longed to expect that pictures of the magazine have been diminished in the last two years before the official advertisement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "beauty, the models" than "models that are famous" were on the cover.
Oscar prize carrier and dior brand messenger Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even in the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "Durchbruch Model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of it applies to anyone).
They are really talented women who are characterized in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit stressed.
In June, the serious Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to pass on the point of distress.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue September edition.
She is a super model in the real sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she is watching in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community rights centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's needs for assistance are rejected annually by the Community legal centres, while the industry has the impact of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, migrants, helpful workers, victims of violence, and those who have no means of unfair delocations and similar things - are already rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exhausted, are prepared for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funds.
The director of the municipal court centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that without repealing the decision of the Federal Government, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland municipal rights centres are chronicly underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inconsistent and impressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce funds by 30 per cent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more helpful people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the General Lawyer and the Federal Minister of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these declines immediately, so that people can receive the help they need for legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise appropriations for legal aid on the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community law centres and their customer communities and to invest Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees claimed to have taken a weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of claiming inactivity after her was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February had directed a shooting weapon to an employee while they were traveling in a jeep in February.
The event is described in a judicial document submitted on Wednesday in the state court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini argued that he had waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right point finger on the depth, and hit the run in Vincent's Knikehle," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other persons had already experienced the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the prosecution.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to hurt," said Bordini.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered an upset when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - Shooters and Gun Friends - should take measures if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be elected and judged.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of the context and that he would not stumble to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damage replacement of the campaign for injury to care and Philip's due to body injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unreachable for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
On calls at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not responded.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Colonel Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Country choice survey: Lose SPD and CDU
In the coming elections in the Federal States of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This resulted in representative surveys by the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Photo" stage (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could hardly go on in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thereby have good chances to continue with the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
The party, according to the survey, was only close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 per cent (previously 18.4 per cent) and the AfD would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in the land day.
In spite of mild losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) the Greens will retreat into the heavy country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day by 3 per cent each.
In the Berliner Wahl, the SPD of the survey would only be 23 percent (option 2011: 28,3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17,6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the House of MEPs.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope that the pirates would miss the withdrawal in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost a half kilo and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be sufficient for some two self-suppressed selfies today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet.
Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer cebit in Hannover as "Büro in the Westentaske Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to get a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicationer could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, even painfully slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euro.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
No one could realize in August 1996 that the communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything's different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market dominates suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and be online everywhere, this is today for very many people everyday.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple alone, 555 million pieces.
The global turnover with the devices is about 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running businesses of countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now developed around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicationer to easily operate everything by touch screen.
The victory of Apple started, the iPhone is the most important product of the group today.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, were looking out.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is a naturality 20 years after its invention.
In cut today, each German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," just said Janina Ball, responsible for staff in the Siemens Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered as curse and blessing at the same time.
England has to guide the Olympic Spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country, not only in our local municipalities and throughout London.
For me, this represented the largest attraction of Heathrows, as did in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching places, create 40,000 new jobs, and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world scenes.
The twoflers were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion £ in scientific growth, and to leave an absence of capabilities and employment both in order to leave the airport and the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, elected by T5 - the five years followed by the world's best airport terminal, until the T2 was built in the midst of the world's two frequentest runs.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion of private investments.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, as well as ensure our future trade and create a power of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse Game" regarding Adblocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid advertising blocking, are similar to a "Katz and Mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block adblocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to reblock advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertising advertising to identify the part of the page advertising is difficult.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to overcome the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-her fight between the advertising open source community and the surroundings has already been in progress since the invention of adblockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how anxious advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are using adblockers; almost four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users accessing Facebook via their mobile end devices daily, mobile advertising represents 84 percent of Facebook advertising.
The company has seen it on advertising blockers on Desktop PCs, since mobile advertising blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs represents a sufficiently large proportion of revenues, so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update his "display preference tool" to have more control over the people's targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be anxious about new filters because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," an Facebook speaker informed in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a stupid means, so we have concentrated on developers tools like Ad Preferences instead to put more control into people's hands.
In case of suicide suicide suicide on a Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman had been driven on a motorway in the early morning on Thursday at a suicide suicide of several vehicles.
The event occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in a act of despair" and was hit by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is evident that a Swiss woman aged 49, who was overridden by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died still on the place.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said that they and every witness of the incident are invited to report.
A investigation procedure was opened which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains to wait for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not dragged to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a footman runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the suspicious killing after she had crossed and killed a man who was in August 2014 on the A1 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court took it.
The court found that the policeman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "complete exceptional and unforeseen situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabitant
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, the Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density atmosphere could once have shown similar conditions.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earthly atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to safeguard life and protect against faster dilution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainscreen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun heat.
The result are average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to the evolution that planet researchers have suspected before.
Although she was once likely to be inhabited, the Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were diluted and their water vapour was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen was removed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to a too small co-determining right in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
During the summer, I've been thinking about how to improve this team to give it more depth, this needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey operations must be perfectly coordinated to the organisation.
It must also have a codecision law in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions for the team.
"Patrick has informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded as the winner of the Jack Adams Award during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the best trainer of the Liga.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in the Central vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers reconversing, discontinuing strike
Labour struggles regarding remuneration for North Sea oil workers are being exposed, while all parties are putting themselves to the table for a new discussion round, said negotiating leaders.
Streiks against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to resolve the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea this year by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10-percentage decline for unshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions provide the company with the necessary space to get through the market disappearance.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas businesses in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes his business as a result of his mega coupling with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower Road Help Travel, an economic situation which has been strengthened by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
In early this week, the Scottish Member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders to discuss one of the largest disputes of work that have been held in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in an explanation.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star bunch of Plejaden
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Plejades.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why stars in the star bunch rotate to different rates and in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary enlargement.
"We hope that we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star bunch of Plejadens is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star bunch, which came up about 125 million years ago, now reach adult age.
They're turning faster now.
At the top rotation rates, these mature stars expose great amounts to star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by acknowledging the time between the appearance of a conscious star spot -- as sun spots --
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are slower to rotate than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slow pirouettes than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejaden we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, but faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star bunch of plejadens is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stable quality such as rotation rates.
"The star bunch of Plejadens offers an anchor for theoretical models of stealing rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow their rotation rates and, as it were, hang up their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports more detailed about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star departs
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old professional will be wearing the tricot of his New York Yankees for the last time on August 12th against Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say "Goodbye" to both," explained the 14-time All-Star-Game-Participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was chosen to be the most valuable player of the Liga, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has made him $27 million per year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his team ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the glory hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - the nickname "A-Rod" was on the field, so controversy is his appearance outside the place.
Already in 2009, the Superstar at "ESPN" admitted that steroiders were banned between 2001 and 2003.
Due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal, he was locked for 211 parties in August 2013 until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect, for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida to have received power-promoting funds.
After a dispute, the barrier was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez then suffisant.
Also, his departure days do not go noiseless.
While many baseball teams have received the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a goodbye tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, and was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, sympathy advertisements of the fans of the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the adherents sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Targetinski are first baptism cases
Captured: Due to a positive doping sample, the weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A captured athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000 meters-historic runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - right before the start of the athlete's critical competitions are coming into time.
The diuretics of hydrochlorothiazide had been proven in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the predecessions over 50 m free style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B samples and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the issue "very seriously and demands full cooperation with Chen in the investigations", quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and will accept the judgment".
The first time in history is no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for sancting athletes with positive cases.
Similarly, in the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "a incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the light athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to the BNT, the B-test should have already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism to the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are observed, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, not all weight lifters from the chronic doping-lasted nation are allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympician in class up to 85 kg, as his brother Tomasz had been tested three days earlier positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both dispute the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, the case of Danekowa is a further severe battle for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF had forbidden the entire Russian crew to a exception because of systematic dopings, also producing a number of bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the former crimes in China had also provided for violent disputes between the athletes.
Thus the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pinched purple."
"If I see the podium over 200 m free style, I want to surrender," said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun was also focused on a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping frauds," said this.
In 2014, Sun was tested positively on the stimulan trimetazidine in the Chinese championships, but only a three-month block had to be seated.
Data record: So perfide press Hacker her ransom money
Programmers of depressive malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defence specialists malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies in question have been at least once, partly multiplely victims of an attack with erpresser software in the past 12 months.
Already in Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were once targets of Ransomware-expression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the transitors to re-use the attacked systems and data.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the actors specialize their eruption software on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially exhaustive ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrible rapid evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the actors discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to companies attacks has been terrible in the past months.
Ransomware works by a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, searches targeted for newly modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainablely.
Afterwards, the software presents the demands of the pressers.
To get the end encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, businesses are about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is still.
Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware is incurred.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt business completely, in one case people were in life risk.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical documents.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies who pay receive their data.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of deceivers in view of stopping in operation.
The hackers again know this and try everything to build up a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user surfaces and contact with the pressers and come to the result: The deceivers are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, fix freely accessible support websites, or unencrypt without prejudice to example files.
And if private people are resolved after payments from a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from Ransomware-expression, the hackers become more professional and share their work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski by the antivirus provider Sophos: "One individual person can write a ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software-building box to the actual depressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consultancy and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"Included in delivery range is an adapter tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The depressors then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually the criminals then commission spammer with distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company-IT responsible in the malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend Ransomware by means of file backups and scanner software.
Therefore, the actors are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful erection, the actors threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential of damage depends on the type of data is far more often higher than before.
In the future, actors could also take up completely new goals on the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could be worth so many victims a ransom.
If the actors then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the fund, it doesn't seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and function pleasantly, only the cockpit overside is a little down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the vacuum.
It is not only available a suitcase of 453 l in high and 1026 l in surrounded backbones, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magic than it sounds: The seats of the back bank can be rolled up like a cinema seat seat, thus offering space that is from the floor to the ceiling 1,24 m high.
The suitcase can be loaded well, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation ranges.
However, he should do his work slightly slower.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasant.
There is another motorization: a 1.5 l benzine with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-rad drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
However, the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top variant "Executive".
The security systems include the City-Notbrems assistant (working until Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track hold assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles when ranking as "coming objects".
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo ruler responds to the identification of transport marks and, if necessary, threws the speed.
However, there is full connectivity only for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI books are under the arms and are therefore something to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are okay.
Those who do not want to invest so much receive the petroleum from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on a passenger bridge
An airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For a liability is only possible in the case of dangers typical for air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Act.: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knee shield at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damage.
Disease: When the organiser pays
Diseased holidays will only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was severely ill by diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish vacation.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their disease led the holidays to a defective clearance system that was supposed to have polluted the seawater.
The family believed that the trip was inadequate - and complained against the organiser.
The applicants had no success before the court.
Although the clearing system was actually defective.
However, the organiser heard of it only shortly before the complainants were departed.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, so the judgment.
In particular, no contamination was found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by inflammation among one another - is a general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The State must respond consciously and decisively at the same time to terrorist risks.
Surely, our land will not answer the violence of the transgressors with hatred and division.
This victory will not be the terrorists.
However, if criminals have to leave the country faster, this increases security and strengthens the consent of the people for refugee policy.
De Maizière wishes to implement the proposals until the Federal Day election in 2017.
He also announced a further personal reinforcement of security forces, which is "in the middle four-stage size order over several years".
Sympathetic heritage for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance should be improved, weapons law is novelled so that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult.
The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors should be preserved according to the Maiziere words.
However, in a dialogue with the physician community, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risks of citizens, he said about psychic insights.
In order to counteract the radicalization of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use covered researchers.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security."
It is important that the Interior Minister has made a clear statement against actionism.
"This was an earfig for the scarfmakers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected the Union's call for a Burka ban and abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-degradation is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I'm rejecting the carrying of the Burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter sent the minister to simulate action and ability with always new anti-terror packages.
Left-Parteichef Bernd Riexinger said: "Flot speeches and a reinforcement of the right of residence brings people in this country no more security."
Better transport flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the legal deficit should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in the traffic on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16th/17th August) the country business of road construction extends the track of law by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure of Wessel Street.
Car drivers can then stick directly from the Hammer Street to the right.
The great advantage: Transport is divided in early times, thus improving the overall expiry on the frequently driven section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representation Münster-West.
The railway connection on the supplies nerves the car drivers mainly between 17 and 19 p.m.
Working days the backstay reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond it.
Base is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the departure of the Wessel Street.
From here, traffic is only spurred through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt for good end quarters years ago.
The reason: Static calculations revealed that the bridge no longer had the necessary tragic force to take the heavy load traffic in question.
How long this Engpass and the working day-to-day work will last, the competent country holding cannot say.
However, years are expected: for the bridge has an official remaining use duration by 2034.
For the extension of the legal deferral, the national company has deliberately chosen the weaker time in school holidays because it is expected to be disabilities.
Traffic will be carried forward on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School Children's House has visited an idea of the prize-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the young Theatre of Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the Association of Nima, 19 students aged 11 to 15 visited the incentive in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set the objective of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project.
Most of the young people of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among other things, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they had been able to follow the course of action, says the press release of the young theatre Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languageel, and the young theatre will work together in the next playtime in a music theatre project.
From October to December, youths, with and without a escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years, are to be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of song, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre game and theatral language mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the rising numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star snoups: Hope of weather improvement
The weather has made the starsnappers in the southwest of Germany a strike in the night on Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of star snoups in the sky.
The starships are Perseides, one of the fastest star snoups with 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the star image of Perseus that rises up in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you're walking around forever, at night you're staying awake for hours, the morning is long before the waking is no longer thinking of sleep.
That's all other than relaxing.
After all, you have such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
What are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many reasons to them, stressing Hans-Günter Weet, director of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand is landing below, but the insomnia, i.e., is a disturbance of insomnia and sleeping.
Just sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German physician association with practice in the Dutch Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Thereafter organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also medications can be found.
Uncommonly, sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common in a depression," says Wessen.
And it may be that different factors affect each other.
For example, if you have a band disc incident, you may be badly awakening every two to three hours and you may begin to crush over everyday problems and concerns, weath gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to your doctor with sleep disorders?
If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected on the day, you should go to your doctor, know Weet.
The impression can look very different: you are depressed, tired, sleepless, have difficulties with attention and concentration, are slightly irritable, have mood disorders or physical disorders such as stomach or headaches.
To reduce sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include changes in behavior, cognitive behavior therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets are subject only in the exceptional case and not more than for two weeks.
In Germany, low-level sleep medicines are hardly available, stressing Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in the case of sleep problems, you should first contact your home doctor, knowing Wessen.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what's happening?
For the study in the sleeping laboratory, doctors, for example, advise in the case of snorches with athemaus sets, in sick day tiredness, in sleeping migrants, or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Don't sleep at lunch," says Fietze.
After cableing, you go to bed at your normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body, you wear a noseglass, a breast belt and a fühler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping one.
How can the subjects handle the problems?
There are quite many screws that can be used for better sleep.
Being counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, not sighting for sleeping, avoiding alcohol, and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to expect to be immediately, and that is absolutely not helpful.
What the jungle camp has with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler expressed himself on Facebook for the disappointing cut of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he picked up gold at the shortway world championships in Doha for the first time, while at the same time putting up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has set himself on Facebook protecting against his ex-team colleagues who are in criticism.
"In a country in which an olympiaeger receives a premium of 20,000€ and a jungle king of 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The aid system in swimming sports is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that are very profound and do not look so accurately at the topic of doping or even do it.
"I don't say that the controls should be set up here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to have been reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
It is the same way to keep it with countries.
"Who is not able to be controlled by independent controllers of WADA/FINA for a certain time before WM/OS, must not take part," calls the electoral Hamburger, who is currently operating an ice part.
Airport: bands of luggage thiefs arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of the Düsseldorf Police managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several pocket and baggage steels as bands.
At 21.30 p.m. civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from previous deceaseds of the steel.
The two women and two men had committed several delicates since mid-July this year and had acted jointly, working particulate and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Commissioner of Criminal 34 can prove four acts to the thiefs who were specifically committed to committing crimes to Germany.
They had totally spent over EUR 155,000.
Old buildings, a few Linden trees, between the rest of a headstone patch: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work on the first look, but the police are among the "hazardous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to the west, you get through playgrounds, a freshly stretched children's garden and a bioshop.
To the phasade of a grey house, someone has screwed "shocky!"
Against a Lidl, which is to be cut off soon, is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created here.
However, articles about this "three town part", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferable in the last few weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have hire contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has been pronounced several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms at the ground floor, the cadderschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patroled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from joining the house with number 94.
In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms in order of the unknown household owners.
On July 13th, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the refusal had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers resigned under the joy of sympathisants and inhabitants.
This summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the citizen climb in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in the form of late.
A primary school and children's gardens are located in the immediate vicinity of house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neubauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is particularly geniused by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiss that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing lefts.
The grave, which the Berliner Innensenator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors seems not to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
Also house crews and their home projects have been part of Kiez for a long time: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.
While the Mainzer had been cleared under great police order in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former household owners are now sharing their Kiez.
This is also observed in the rents which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rents.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on injected discs or freshly stroked phasades, which were beared with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are harmful matters that tend to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of insecurity.
In the case of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars have been out of the Rigaer right now.
For the studied architecture, their road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than else."
New Builders have deliberately moved into the Riga Street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for her that the inhabitants returned their road: from the police, politics and the media, all suddenly claimed the deliberation of the city in July.
However, in the eyes of inhabitants like new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building holes that extrude the old inhabitants.
"These are eventually property apartments that are not interesting for many people here - they live here rather people who are not so well covered," she says.
"Polition and destruction I can't accept."
But what do you do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for attractive people who are angry with color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Anyone who draws out should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a naked area can be badly complaining about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organisation.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities and others.
Regine customer from the working circle suggests that the officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now here, the egg-laying wool milksau, which has a problem mainly.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than rather to the number of desired areas - had meant targeting as the administration wanted to describe the body.
A administrative professional was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in social work, just a egg-laying wool milksau.
However, administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
In particular, it concerns organization, work with people on the ground, and even behind the scenes and networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has delayed a 50-percent rate to three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and principal actors.
There are major and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Nearly new containers are in the waterway
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the transfer of connections.
They must stay refugees in their own or hired living rooms.
The cost of construction, renting or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
Responsibilities are switched from the Board of Country to Municipality and Job Center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It is not working until now that you are dependent on private homes, says Deuschle.
Therefore, public housing needs to be educated, as it is called so beautiful.
So soon new containers are set up in the waterway.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the label, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
Besides a fixed stay, there are practice sites, training sites, school places, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine Customer.
Many work in the Building or help housemasters, do publicly useful work - motivated and very convenient, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will result in a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy".
But activity does not mean work only.
The day needs a fixed structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of association.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with local and especially language courses.
Professional courses are strange.
So there are also governments and officials in here.
It is central that refugees feel that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and that they can overcome time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who ever develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, may not work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "men who don't have anything to do with." The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is a "mammut task".
A difficult question: Do they, after the latest events, fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," Regine's customer says very clearly, "what some people may call naive." But a rest risk could and wouldn't want to exclude them.
But the helpers were aware.
These events are also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assaults will bring them completely into trial.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main and honourable officials in the region must look out for activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new hit of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics are shocking.
Actually, it's unfair to put them helpers on site.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we can go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customers also make it clear that the Urbachers are already exhausted to integrate the people who have been in the past reasonably.
These are now about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Searched inbreaker with helicopters
The police hub screw fled away for about an hour - without success.
On Friday morning at 8.50 a.m., two unknown men were violently entering an apartment in a multi-family house in Lindenweg.
The inhabitant amazed the two, and struck the disaster into the escape.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 meters tall, well masked, wearing both Bluejeans and Black Capuzenpullis.
They fled to the city centre.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police hub screw.
The flag passed without success.
The unknowns may have noticed before the deed near the apartment or when they escaped.
