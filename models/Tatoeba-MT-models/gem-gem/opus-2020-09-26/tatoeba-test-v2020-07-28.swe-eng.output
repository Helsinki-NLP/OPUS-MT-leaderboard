How can I stop Tom?
Is there anybody there?
It wouldn't matter anyway.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
He went into the bank dressed out as a guard.
I can't do it now.

I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teaches.
She's taken too much work on herself.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a grip.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're going to be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under tag wire.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.

Have I forgotten something?
You're longer than me.
Congratulations on birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech trampled me out.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do what Tom suggests, unless anyone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only talk to myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt who is chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself justified.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about the ring-trilogin?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not a easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Be greeted, gilles brother.
Where's the Portuguese embassy?
My friends didn't betray me during the trial.
Tom shot me in my leg.
I was just irritating.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here's Tom.
I don't like the modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Get dressed fast.
I took the photo.
I said good morning.

No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with dirty masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
Nothing of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom fooled me.
Tom helps.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even in the vicinity of being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
It's time to leave your sets.
My father's healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a few gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've done it already.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquitoes.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom a hit between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She acts like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train quickly accelerated.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but you can at least accept that there are people who have other opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English are hard, right?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't expect to see him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet dependency.
I never thought it would be so difficult to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here who's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men were smiling.
Come and sit down.
It must be enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motor sauce is broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This will take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
A ink fish has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come and talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.
Of Finnish people, about 4.9% of Finnish people, that is, people with Swedish as a native language.
Unfortunately, Tom left.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding gate.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attended a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like that?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver wound the wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
All dreams.
Miles are made on wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you were going to feel yourself.
When I came home, I discovered the interrupt.
The cat has two ears.
Actually not.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes singing.
Christ is the resurrection!
I need your opinions.
I've had a hard afternoon.

I don't see anybody.
The more you get to know her, the more you will like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
