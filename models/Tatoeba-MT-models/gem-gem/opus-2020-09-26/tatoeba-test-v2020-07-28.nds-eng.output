I'm driving the bike to work.
Did you know my Watder?
He's a good tomato today.
We can't help him.
I forgot what I wanted to say.
What browser are you using?
Are you talking Latvian?
I don't know.
Belgium is not as large as France.
Ria's got a very long hearing.
You're not talking to anybody?
I don't remember his name anymore.
We were at the Mühl, close to the Hempfeld.
Not yet.
Swimming is forbidden here.
I'm hearing the next song of Björk.
I'd like to deliver Selter.
My children are in school.
Are you always in Scotland?
There are many stars that are larger than the sun.
Hello, Tom.
Why have you tried to run away?
That's interesting.
What did Tom have to do with me?
Ria crawled under the bed, but her mud found it.
Everyone agreed to his idea.
We need to help him.
You didn't know that either.
Do you know the difference between silver and tinn?
I've never heard from the city.
I've been doing as much as Tom did.
Where do you know my name?
Nothing glored me.
They couldn't see it in the face.
