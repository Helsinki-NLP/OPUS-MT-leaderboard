Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
There is a disturbance among the members of the National Assembly of Wales by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party stated that MWP “moves on Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: twp is crazy for Welsh and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘unsatisfied’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party is ‘open’ for the change of name, but note that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drawing up legislation to implement the change of name, said: 'There are, of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.'
With the Government of the Act of Wales 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were entitled to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people believed that the National Assembly should be baptized into Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP was most supported in public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus, which will have to submit a legislative draft on the changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will be able to finally vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the change of their country's name
On Sunday, voters vote if they want to change their country's name to 'Republic of Northern Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve an appealing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbourhood means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to the requests of Macedonia to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum's referendum, has said that he will not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, advocates of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's harmful
"The older people with whom I spoke said that there was a cafe and a church in the past on each corner," said Mr Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to be detected here."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
"Men now have a different way of social contact," he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people regularly go.”
However, he is worried that the profits of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long as the leaders expect, "and early or late will leave them back at the beginning."
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would not help in the remaining refugees of the neighborhood.
“The large majority of the people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches to be closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were ever built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metropool: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under the leadership of Prime John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot from the shopkeepers in 125th Street, an important shop street in Harlem, where black people could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishes of Mr Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Honor Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beard proud “the clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'an cultural treasure' and 'an unreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger beard of the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some hired by the league leaders of the church, others by the bisdom.
The consistency (the governing body of the parliament, consisting of league leaders) wrote the bisdom in July to express its concern that the bisdom “will want to calculate the costs” to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in the rent of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the bisdom.
Some parochians complained about the lack of transparency of the bisdom.
Hai hurts 13-year-old who dok to lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who went to lobsters in California.
The attack took place just for seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had done about half an hour with friends when he heard the boy scream for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought the boy cried because he had caught a crawl, but then he realized “the boy cried:“I have been bite!
I'm bitter!"
His key leg was completely open," he saw Hammel when he approached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should go out of the water, "There is a shark in the water."
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is supposed to be at risk of life.
It's not a conscience which kind of sharks are responsible for the attack.
Beach Guard Captain Larry Giles told at a press conference that a shark had been ridiculed a few weeks earlier, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured by the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to break through on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's starts competition with Boots, Super Drugs and Debenhams and sets out beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in storehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth 2,8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 stores throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be introduced to more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the series of television, microwaves and interior articles with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time branding such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also the existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees gets more place, with table per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up on the market again, since most products are suitable for veganists, something younger shoppers increasingly demand.
In addition, parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first one is previously opened in Croydon, south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food daily in local supermarkets, supermarkets have to make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like supermarket houses, now that the supermarket chain takes it against discounts Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's have integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and have also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have resulted in more profit.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments of Beauty and Pharmacy a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's testing cooperation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but cooperation was ended when a conflict arose about the distribution of income from the pharmaceutical department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's were 281 pharmaceutical departments in the shops three years ago for a amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive gamma of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: ‘We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department, so this is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, which will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer to each one a little willing, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations, we ensure that our customers are happy to buy their beauty products with us and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'would' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'wicking' because the TV-presentant Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentatrice of This Morning announced on Instagram that she leaves.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is raging on Holly Willoughby because she has withdrawn from her profitable lifestyle company at the last time to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “wored” when Willoughby was on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she was not spending enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories through her new contracts (with a value of half a million pounds).
The company is compared to the brand Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced that she would leave Truly, Jones went to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future and produce enough for the next decades.
Everyone was exhausted when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatric, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investment in products from kiss and candles to clothing and homewear, and because launching could now increase further delays.
And that could mean the end of a yearly friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a share of 40 per cent in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be a M&S marking door and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentation of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British Sender ITV.
A source from the enthusiasm of Jones said last night: "We have no comment on his business affairs."
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He wondered about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment that he made that some people would find “unestablished for a president” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I didn't give up."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a great step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been closed.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘equivalent’ response by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the elections.
"We're doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results, and the missile tests have been completed, hostaged were freed, and the material surpluses of American military have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach as to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s as easy to behave as a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, some 200 people would stand here,” said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island with hundreds of deaths
In the follow-up of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had no residence, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for launching international aid.
"In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they do not apply for international assistance, which is difficult for us," said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is uncertain whether the abroad providers can work on site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the agency for assistance in national disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, hiding places were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see these.
The fact that there was no warning iron for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in force, probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal circumstances, it can also be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship in Lombok was announced to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the place of disaster.
The improvement of the sealess infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the key points of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent abundant money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a shortage of funding, and it hopes to be reelected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their home because Christian and Islamic gangs fought on the street, with machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalizers to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge protected Liverpool last Saturday from loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 meters from the goal of Chelsea, when his team was behind with 1-0.
He ticked left to the ball and then shaved towards the worst stake.
The ball fled high above the penaltyship area, towards the upper right corner of the net.
He cultivated the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Rande approaching and risking a effort. I didn't really think about it, I just kicked on the ball."
Chelsea was at rest with 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The peak of The Blues kicked the ball with its heel to Mateo Kovacic, then speeded through the middle field to the play half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle field.
After that, he gave a beautiful passport, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty shipping area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the backer stake.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadio San Paolo in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea takes up Thursday at 15 o'clock in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The death rate of tsunami in Indonesia is up to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, said the agency for aid in national disasters on Sunday morning.
Many people were stuck in the ruin of buildings that had crashed as a result of the earthquake with a power of 7.5 of the previous Friday, with waves also rising from 6 meters high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is filled with ruined buildings.

Cromwell's statue to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-Rel
The exil of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious objects carried out by his fanatic purite followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr Crick as 'dwaas' and 'a attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the visas of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered, nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness to the opinion that ruled in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many say still needs to be recognized.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as parliamentary defence against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognised and recalled."
Mortal none killed Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, whose only surname is known as ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a steel on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His slagader was surrounded and he was under blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the infusion of pigs at a pigstal, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was supposed to have traveled from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring swine stalk.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood was on his mouth in the pig shock.
A forensic investigation showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said the cousin with the last name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 o'clock to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market officer told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while the police collected evidence in place.
It is said that the Yuan family and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have already been cases of pigs attacking people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, which caused the man to get seriously wounded.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife threw away the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News witnessed that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They are just plays.
They're like kids, very curious, they're not going to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,' he said.
The tail of the orchestra Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As foretold, orcan Rosa is weak when she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rain to the north of Mexico and southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a local orchestra of Category 1 on Sunday morning at 5 o'clock and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trog begins to form above the Pacific, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that responds with the approach will cause widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause hazardous floods, ruin flows and possible earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to decline from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 5 to 10 cm rain in parts of the southwest, especially above the largest part of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly recommended to enter the desert at foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can surround ravines in desolate rivers, and storms will produce local windflags and dust.
The nearby trog brings some heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small puin flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rain season.
Distributed tropical rain will approach Arizona Sunday evening to Monday morning, then the rain will be spread more on Monday end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread on Tuesday over the Four Corners and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the United States can be strongly shocked because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the troops remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the Middle and Eastern United States, October is expected to begin warm, with temperatures scaming around the 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it can become 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance is high until mid-October at above average temperatures in the Eastern United States.
More than 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people looked at one of the six television networks for the striking testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the US Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a assault that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the complaint for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was in trouble and tried to pull out her clothes at a festival at high school.
Kavanaugh stated in a provoked witness that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have probably looked at on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually finds it hard to count people who look at a office.
In comparison, that is about like for a play-off of a football match or for the Oscar-out.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: average 5,69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued an explanation that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that protestors shouted to him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing from the Commission for Justice.
He stayed a few minutes with depressed eyes while he was ridiculed, live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had delivered a statement, and closed just before the elevator, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various transmitters did all live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote in favour only with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated against the next week, something which the Democrats of the Minority insist on.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation for the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were criticizing their plans to leave the European Union of a 'political game' with the future of Great Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson emphasized his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit and said that her suggestion that Britain and the EU should enter each other's charges was 'absurd'.
Fire party Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for suspicion of murder, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the place and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police asked Simpson and later declared that he had confessed that he had shot Wayde with death.
His warranty has been established at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The body-viewer of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a provisional report on Friday which states that the cause of death is a shot in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of State Police, the Southern University police and local inhabitants have all contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his 'deployment and pursuit of justice'.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race in the previous season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team “captured” and “in shock” was killed by Waydes.
“This is an event you always hope it will never happen,” says Wade.
Vulcan spouts as in Mexico City
The axis sprayed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater was picked up and 183 gas emissions and ash were registered in a period of 24 hours.
The center detected several times garbage and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ashes appeared on car routes in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when a earthquake met with a power of 7.1 at the scale of Richter central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Political conflict with Catalan separatists on the morning of the birthday of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independent activists struck with the rebellion policy, while thousands of participants in rivalising demonstrations on the occasion of the first birthday of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which disintegrated the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separators that were stopped by the rebellion police swallowed the agents with eggs and powder painting, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screen excavations broke out with the police, and the cops picked up their cup to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: 'Don't forget, do not forgive', while their opponents called 'Long Life Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries they were complaining during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independent region, a year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers to be illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters were excitingly pronounced to become independent, although the arrival was low and the people who were opposed to divorce the vote boycotten.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were hurt last year after the police had tried to stop voting in the voting agencies in the region, with violent screen excavations.
Pro-independence groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday in order to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of independence of Catalonia.
“We experienced one of our most beautiful moments last year.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck,' he said.
Although the Catalan Pro-Independence Parties achieved a victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was neat, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success, because many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in exile or in prison, waiting for a trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old assembly who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasingly rising," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in preliminary arrest since the end of last year, declared that he is participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was stuck with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly crashed in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves had been damaged.
A crossbow may also have been fired on the car at a given time.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the objective of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and made Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt was equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed in this season to win an outcourse during the Premiership. They have to take up the Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston remains in the meantime unattended. The team has already won six matches in his department, and trainer Holt hasn't had any defeat since he let Kenny Miler replace last month.
Livingston loses chances for strong visitors
The team of Holt had long before the first goal to achieve a advance, because their direct way of playing caused various problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up the headball of Craig Halkett, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team made the Rangers play with pleasant pleasure, and waited for his chances to be quiet and self-safe.
And that eventually led to the crucial objective.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston made a opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scourged from the criminal field.
At that time, the Rangers had been balconying for a long time, but the defence of the home team was inevitable and the target Liam Kelly had not had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made it possible to prevent Kelly from a goal.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the feet of the Rangers targeter Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after his colleagues from Livingston.
Continuously reached Livingston's penalty area, but they were charged every time. Two times a penaltyship was denied, one after Halkett's attack on invading Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to exceed the expectations in their race to the top.
Their game style and the composition of their team has almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has swept up the team since his coming.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes during the entire race.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they succeeded only once to distinguish the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are in the middle of the classification.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Köln
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (29 September).
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO alliances.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Köln for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cold is the home basis of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police called on the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathists came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, heard their voice, condemned both the policy of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The rivalising protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and is accused by others as autocrate.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies after collision with car
In London a cyclist died in a collision with a car involved.
The accident occurred near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 o'clock local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died in place.
A few months ago, another bicycler died in an accident with flight crime at Childers Street, about half a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were about to identify the man and his nearest family will inform.
The road is closed in various places, buses are redirected and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six capes injured in order disorder
Six cops have been hurt at a order disorder in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison office.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 o'clock local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ captains are involved in resolving the situation, with eight prisoners involved in one section.
The capers were treated places for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the prisoner said: ‘There has been specially trained prison staff for a recent incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsibilities are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind the traps.'
In HMP Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year the rebellion police was called to prison for a serious disturbance in order to attack staff with billion balls.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects on dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week. This is because the remaining energy of the orchestra Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, which poses risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday right above Phoenix. Monday evening it will already be raining.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a Tweet that “sin 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm downfall, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Bekken, will probably receive 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
The rain of Rosa can be a blessing for those areas that are not at risk of flooding because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of these rainfalles will likely be favorable because the southwest is currently undergoing dryness.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drying areas are indicated, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona spends at least extreme dryness, which is at a second highest category,' weather.com reported.
The route of orcan Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on orchestra strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north with a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rain may fall in parts of Mexico, which leads to a significant risk of flooding.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then enter late Tuesday evening by Arizona and south of Utah.
“The greatest danger expected by Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and ruin flows in the deserts and earthly shifts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests of suspicion of attempts to murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspected attempts to murder after a 16-year-old with stiff injuries was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the district Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at about 4 hours.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, says Avon and Somerset police.
The police ask everyone who may have filmed something of what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered 'under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice before Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the unpleasant and shameful tactic of the Democratic Party," said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure, Kavanaugh has constantly suffered 'under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally the impression of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her enthusiasm during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the 'American people' saw the wonderful and incredible character, the quality and courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to acknowledge Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is recognised, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the multitude of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican emergence at the interim elections.
“In five weeks one of the most important elections in our life will take place.
I don't take part, but actually I'm taking part,' he said.
'These is why I am going everywhere for great candidates.'
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission 'to resist and obstacle us'.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top colleague of the GOP's management told CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll grows
In a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, where many were destroyed from the ground when giant waves fell down on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high land hit at the time it began to schedule. Many people fell to pletter and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was a result of a earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victim of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian agency for help in natural disasters GBP during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, trees, houses, he touched everything on the land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climb into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Some 16.700 people were evakuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On air photos released by the Natural Disaster Assistance Office, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges are scrubbed and crushed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained trembling by nascocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in a region where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb falling on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has still increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had been crashed.
Some deadly victims were stuck under the ruin of ruined buildings, he said. Some 540 people were hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “lights completely flat, we have no information at all,” said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is a tragedy now, but it can get much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building in panic screams down to people on the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast, and buildings and cars are swallowed.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami provided a major stream disturbance that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with aids from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but the evacues still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami dodentol rises over 800.
It's very bad.
It is true that the employees of the World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers at the courtyard of their office are looking for dwelling in ceiling tents, but they passed the scenes of destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when helping groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign providers with a great degree of expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and staff from abroad can not be allowed until the location of a disaster is proclaimed as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been proclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing hoped they would recover their loved ones, such as in the miracles that people like to hear from terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday, a boy was taken out of a riol.
On Sunday, helpers delivered a woman who had been caught under the ruin two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world I carry my own emotional tax,” he said.
Mr Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread into the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival in the following hours.
In his reports, however, only one grey pink appeared instead of two blue fingers.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal 26.750 dollars during the supply of money automation in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26.750 from a staff member of Brink who was filling a money automaat in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press report.
The driver had just cleared a money automation in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, wrote inspector Dennis McCarthy in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind the employee of Brink and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspected flights, according to the press report, but the police did not tell how many people were involved in the incident.
Whoever has information about the identity of the deceaseds, is asked to contact the Newport police at the number 859-292-3680.
Canye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The creature that is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the beginning of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to suggest his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for 'emotional reasons', says the maker of the show.
Ye is not just a shortening of his present artist name. Previously, West told him that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at the Big Boy radio presentation.
"So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means "the only" to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, all.
The album is earlier a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who's changing his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Also, JAY-Z, who had previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the link sign and the uppercase letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised to never use military power against citizens. The country is on the morning of the 50th birthday of a bloody represhal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelco Plaza that he would “never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, where up to 300 people were killed. In that period, left student movements came up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a shortage of opportunities for study.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research by A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this as a result of the announcements on A.I. coming from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants to be the number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations.
“The budget for research into A.I. would already be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next break in A.I.”, said Lee.
A double financing could lead to a doubled chance of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most important A.I. companies of China.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University at an A.I. system that hit the best player in American Othello, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology matches organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place, because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often need to work hard to receive public subsidies, said Lee.
"China doesn't pick in our best academics, the companies do that," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best powers of universities to work on A.I.
Lee said that American efforts in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
'Who doctors in the field of A.I. should automatically get a green card,' he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other public organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Ministry established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and the academic world in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Containing the Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF currently invests over $100 million in research on A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been in vain for months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on possible change in their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in their country's name in the 'Republic of North Macedonia', which would resolve a dispute with Greece for decades and would no longer hinder Greece's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighbourhood means that the country claims in Greek territory, and therefore Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two authorities concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum, and a boycot campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the voting note is as follows: ‘Are you advocate of the NATO and the EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Presidents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that came up when former Yugoslavia distinguished.
“I am voting today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraplu of the European Union, because this will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members have stated that they will respect the outcome, which will become decisive.
In order to change the name, there would be a second decline in Parliament.
The National Electoral Committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was at that time only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a chooser in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the change of name of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the House in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents placed by people who had the referendum boycotten.
“We are the supporter of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member and not through a rear gate,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that the membership of NATO will produce major investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I am convinced that the majority of our citizens are advocates, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are EU and NATO," said Zaev after delivering his voice.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30% and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required arrival.
From another point, carried out by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the policy of the pro-wester government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and scorpion
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measurements with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a cent flute, how Aguero scoorded in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak was first played in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defense and was too fast for some others at the edge of the Brighton penalship area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the criminal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his judge shoe to beat the target Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City to the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We've been lucky he scored a target at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playground of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball a little while and then sent Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues player ticked the ball in the net right before he was too far.
City will take up Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The race will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make the Rockies easy to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are consequences for the participation of the Rockies in the playoff. They are currently standing for one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, the Rockies have at least made a game card for the play-off, but now wants to put everything in place to ensure their first section title.
“Though there is no more for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimum with this public and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I like to play in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on a Sunday but are supposed to be inclined to set Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start his 34th, was on Thursday in the injecting field and would still pitchen next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
The right-handed warper of Washington is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump organises a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republican emergence at the interim elections.
‘All that we have already achieved is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our life will take place in five weeks.
This is one of the really big elections, and I don't take part, but actually I'm taking part, so I'm going everywhere for great candidates,' he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible, radical group of Democrats, we see it happen now.
And they are determined to take back the power, regardless of what they have to do for it.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to do away in order to get power and control; that is what they want: power and control, but we will not give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "combat resistance and obstacle us".
“And we have seen that in the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats ‘boos and common and false and lieful’.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
‘Do you remember what she answered?
Did you read the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant for people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censure me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour parliamentary members who have made us not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for censur because I wasn't agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues such as those where Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting was announced on Friday: ‘We want the meetings to be included and productive.’
And that was so during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I am a local Labour parliamentary member.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has forgotten the promise of a 'graciouser, softer' politics long if it had ever started.
It becomes increasingly clear that an abnormal opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party management or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Collegas who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I, suddenly expected that I would turn around and take a position that I would never otherwise have agreed with, from topics such as national security to the European unity market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are social media partys who are called for to reject my candidate as a Member of Parliament for the next elections, where the politics of the centre are exposed and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
In fact, I know that I am more lucky than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that dispute parties seem to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every 'motion of distrust' or change of selection rules, the party becomes smallest.
In the past two years, I have often been advised to keep myself disgusting, not simply to preach my opinion, and then I would not “come into trouble”.
But I did not go into politics for this.
Since I became a member of Labour in school 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of the Government of Thatcher which literally broke my classroom, I have always asked for better public services for those they most need, both in my role as a member of the congregation and in my role as minister.
I never hide my politics, even during the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clearness about my policy positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motif on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves forward to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting in accordance with what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmade Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trials may have made the final result somewhat miserable, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs rightly in this wonderful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the classification, the only unsuccessful team of the ten.
Eventually, it was their superior defense and their better chances that the home team caused the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We have had it difficult until now during our matches and we are still unbought, so I am a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: 'All honor to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we.'
Grant Andersons' trial in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes from the Scotian national team (which he received during the warriors) Melrose was able to speak the figures and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
Climo provided a penalty for an extra advance for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry net before rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose began the second half well and the trial of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the advance to five points.
The match was a long time for a serious blessing of Ruaridh Knott, which was taken off on a brancard, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue to run by a trial of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Commander Blair Macpherson from Ayr received a yellow map, and again recounted Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed on a try by Bruce Colvine at the end of a race where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he handled Climo without the ball, MacPherson provided a touch-down to the penalty-line-out behind the uptaking Ayr-mouth.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe got the box kick of David Armstrong and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try from the home team.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran is going from Still Game to the horeca. He is evidently appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth series incoming will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craig has been planning.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘blooding restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours: the country-in-law of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sealui patrol in a marina office in La Paz.
On public buildings, an ocean blue flag is waving.
On all marine bases from the Titicaca lake to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country surrounded by Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country had to give up after a bloody 19th-century raw material conflict to Chile is still alive, just as the desire to retain the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the past decades, since Bolivia is waiting for an Opinion of the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will consider the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will in the benefit of Bolivia that Chili, after decades of tough discussions, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial fight for re-election, is a lot at stake with the Monday decision.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analytists believe that the court will probably not decide for the benefit of Bolivia, and even if so, there would be little change.
The United Nations Organ established in the Netherlands has no jurisdiction to confer the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the conclusion, indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have become even worse over the past four years.
“The matter about access to the sea has been chopped by the current Bolivian government,” said Zárate.
The warful rhetoric of Morales has all the good will that Chile might still have completely undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to continue to talk hereafter.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Den Haag, denies that the decision of the court has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will “be given an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“end 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crucifix.
‘Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
"The statement is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind us."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove his nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the enforced nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'outopia' that the persistent sanctions and American objections against an explanation that will end the Korean war, North Korea will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first put important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and the American President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism, and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would reject a arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your guard collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversize head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, an outstanding move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-blinding creations to the catwalk.
The outstanding piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a four-like broad edge, which hangs over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were water melons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just at the time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a mixed ice.
And if you want to follow this stupid fashion, you'll be lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the strip hat with a two-meter wide edge that wears everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very inpractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided for another large creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in bathing suit that the bag sealed.
The roodoranje raffia bag, decorated with raffia franches and finished with a white leather hanging, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect the coming summer to see large hats and beach bags in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continued and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educative sector that can design and implement a measured school course, we see that modern languages remain outstandingly popular and desired fields within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can not trust in English only when we want to build relationships and a trust bond with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the rank list, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools joined SCIS, show that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the students received German, 69 percent of the students French and 63 percent of the students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as professional choices as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, according to employers, 17 % of the obstacles to fill in vacatures was attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
Language skills are thus increasingly important in preparing young people for their future career.
Now that more and more vacations require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real benefit in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advance to competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that exceeded 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investment in language education is now important for the children of today.
Several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose what languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest is, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this field.
Scotian independent schools are endeavoring to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellentness to young people in Scotland.
I want the bees to be fair.

LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening race on Sunday before the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's still necessary to determine how many minutes he'll play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a Tweet that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After training this week James was asked for his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six matches prior to the season.
“In this stage of my career, I don’t need competitions before the season to prepare myself,” he said.
Period of elections of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of elections
It's the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the next week, including stops in places that love him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate chosen for the vacation in the Supreme Court has been awaited, Trump wants to build support for the coming interim elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
How late will the Trump rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for Candidate Judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were additionally loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misbehavior and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the republics who are candidate for elections in November to get more elan.
President Trump's campaign leadership said that these five rallys are designed to ‘promote volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Delegateds’, says Reuters.
“Congress control is so important for his programme that the president travels to as many states as possible now the pressed campaign season,” said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally of this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia has visited, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the phenomena.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him angry in the phenomenon,” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the start to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon might be just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The foaming swing of chances is a fully invented sports concept, but a player really believes in, and especially in competitors like this.
So who gets the best chances at the moment?
“They first had a six-point advance, and now that is only four more, so we find such a little that the happiness is currently on our side,” said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their seats, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearful opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pound with which four races became a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His fountain with which they won the match on 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind you can conclude from that he believes the American team has not been defeated yet.
"You have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the inconsistent story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but delicious European duo has four in four, and nothing can do wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only duo that did not play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rumoured audience, they are the players that have to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who books a European victory when the sun goes down above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at various holes.
However, it is vigorous to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front nine led to a decline for the Spaniard and the Swedish that they did not get above.
However, on Sunday there is no one who can help to get your backwards.
The four-balls and four-somes are so fascinating to see by the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
So far, the European team has played the best and has a beautiful advance in the beginning of the last day, but this four-some session has also shown that Team USA is willing to combat, something which some, especially in the US, doubts.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful precipitation on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and four-somes of Saturday they stand with 10-6 in the United States.
The delighted duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had it difficult, so they now have up to four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy that she wanted to lose two years ago in Hazeltine was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer recover its backstage.
The team of Jim Furyk has to score eight points during the 12 singles matches of Sunday in order to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Melliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had joined Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully tapped into each other and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who swallowed himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed a wonderful move, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-somes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the four-somes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Yet it was not a leather roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a brie to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
After a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, they won in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after they had lost the first four holes.
It has just happened twice earlier in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to recover a backward of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furike has enough equal, since they are currently in hands of the trophy.
But since they have been on the second place for two days, a counter attack seems too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will 'in no case' unilaterally disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations that the constant sanctions lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ‘important goodwill measures’ last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demanaging the location of nuclear tests and the promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no case disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri repeated the famous North Korean complaints about the opposition of Washington against a 'phased' approach to denuclearisation, rewarding North Korea as the further steps took, it was noted that he did not disapprove the unilateral denuclearization a priori, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri was referring to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work to the 'denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula', while Trump promised warranties for the security of North Korea.
North Korea aims at a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to simplify the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on 'denucratisation first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their objectives in a compelling way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war', said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader did before the week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: 'If the other party was at this issue of denuclarisation South Korea and not the US, the denuclarization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impass.'
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent were directed so after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump Kim called a ‘raketman’ on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there was a lot to happen and that sanctions should remain to North Korea denuclarize.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the Security Council of the UN Pyongyang should reward the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued strongly and definitely until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearisation.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after leaving Pyongyang in July and saying that progress had been made, North Korea betted him to set 'gang-like requirements'.
This month, during a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to demanage a raketite and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘equivalent measures’.
He said that Kim had said to him that the ‘according measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard follow the course of the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing machiculture where it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of worrying themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist connected to the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows this is unique in the United States.
He was given the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep deficiency on learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came to me who said, "Why do I hear this only in my last year?"
She said nobody had ever told her how important sleep is, what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep deficiency during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is influenced by sleep shortage, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
With the help of a map of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the effects of the choice of cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of fierceness on a night, he says, still exists, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deficiency is a increasing problem.
Making sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because the shortage of sleep causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, because he had followed the lesson from the professor last year when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available for everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not only a alarm to rise. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘Blue Light’ of electronics and joint lighting, which can dismant your circuit rhythm, allowing you to have trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Objective of Menga descends the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their excursion race again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard struck with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during an outcourse since they defeated St. Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but the team of Gary Holt provided the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now stands eight points behind on Hearts, which goes further at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes before rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after a object was evidently thrown to him by the supporters of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team, and they stopped Ayr and went to the half finales of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same 11 for Livingston, who knew the Hearts to cut off a point last week. He would have been excited about the way his well trained team knew the opponents to block off at each move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball-owned, but Livingston did more about it.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga left the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the facility, but the middle fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase from Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defender Alan Lithgow shot against the backer stake.
The Rangers managed to take over control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found at least that he had the right to a penaltyship when he and Steven Lawless fought after a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson wiped away the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the target in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was former targetman at the Ibrox, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and the tammy shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the extension of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren't worn against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool bloody and chose Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard provided a interruption with the exchange of Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a kind of match that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to stair long balls.
The Holt team could have increased its advance in the last phase of the competition, but McGregor kept well stand and blocked Jacobs, then Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invasion Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penaltyship after an incident with Jacobs, but Thomson looked again on the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanak of our ‘Sunday Morning’: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day on which the future physicus Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger counter.
The geiger counter has not been thinking out of science since then, and also became an icon in pop culture, for example in "Bells or Coronado", a 1950 film with the first viewed unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: ‘This is a geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms issued by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: 'It's really cracking now.'
"Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ malicious cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see” and kill malicious cells
Vaccin learns immune system to recognize malicious cells in the course of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a labo
They can then “see” a protein that occurs frequently in many types of cancer and is then re-injected
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine learning the immune system to recognize malicious cells saw her egg stick anchor disappearing more than 18 months
With the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, and then the cells in the labo are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2 that often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of various types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovary anchor, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘training’ these cells to treat cancer cells has been shown to work before the treatment of a certain type of leukaemia.
Kanye West is a pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was issued during a post of Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent action in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he becomes a president candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he dropped a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“I often speak to a white person, they ask, ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!”
If I was worried about racism, I'd been leaving America for a long time," he said.
The issue of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood-star Matt Damon kicked the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the suspected assault Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
The tirade of West was not sent out, but strange Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear whether Rock with his post wants to trap the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his pet.
"They have retarded me backstage.
They said, "Don't stop on the stage with that pet."
They've pissed me!
And then they say I'm apathy," he said the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Will you see how apathy looks?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, 'that means you can't command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the public, at least two times, the castle members of SNL were embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard of an attendee: 'The entire studio was suddenly quiet.'
West was the guest as a last minute substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a implementation of the number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who Tweeted: "To one of our most courageous spirits: THAT YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT."
But talkshow-presentatrice Karen Hunter betted that the West was just "usually itself, and that's beautiful."
“But I choose to not reward someone who damages, supports and sprays an ideology to my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
We too', added it.
Before the show began, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. From now on, he says, "the creature that is formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who's changing his name, but he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also behaved the name Snoop Lion and the dead music legending Prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then in The Artist formerly known as Prince.

The accusation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington finds to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as swordfighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actress goes to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such rolls on the screen, they often think they should be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he felt that ‘there has been something wrong’, he asked himself how the problem of toxic male manhood should be addressed in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently married his co-ster of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
"This is really a very important question for me at present: where has our maleness failed?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic male manner through his very male personalities.
He persisted, "What is inborn and what has been taught?"
What is learned on TV and on the street that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's big questions: how do we change that?
For something has obviously failed for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequerors or sequences of Games of Thrones when the series is over next summer, because he is 'free with battlefields and horses'.
From November Kit plays in a revaluation of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a predator.
The actress recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife, Rose, is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife during the series, so I've kept up with my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits personality Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with a Emmy.
The group married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 8200,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case in the past.
HIV has spread quickly in the past in some parts of China by transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people that rise in this way of HIV is now almost zero, Chinese healthcare professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been criminal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is supposed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Frequently, the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff staff has leaked data from Republican senators and draws out to ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
The U.S. Congress member Maxine Waters objects to the accusations that one of her staff staff has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the lawyers.
The Democrate from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are distributed by ‘extreme rights’ disputers and websites.
“Leugnes, liars and even more dirty lies,” said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The data published would include the private address and telephone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misbehavior to the address of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators Kavanaugh had questioned.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState was the IP address that indicates the source of the posts linked to the office of Waters and contained the information of a worker of Waters, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations was in no case responsible for the leaking of these information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The Declaration of Waters has already quickly stood on criticism online, including by former press worker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry," wrote Fleischer.
“Here you can open that she does not have the temperament to be a Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the defendant's motives.
He needs to stay calm and seen."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, which was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday hearing.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Fifty, if it's true," he tweed.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
“We will make the transgressors known,” she said, “and they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British inslag we are now looking traditionally for references to the Brexit, and this is indeed true of the revision of the Johnny English-franchise, the comic action films with a low spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back to life with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is this airy selfatire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with exhaustive eyes and flexible faces at least manages to send everything in the hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already conclude that he is a common comic character that was thought for bioscoop-goers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little wing Mr. Bean and a branch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson ever played in the Barclaycard TV spots (which has been forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and ticks the rotor leaves at his helmet.
Atkinson can well show in this film how much he has talent for physical comedie, but the humor comes rather weakly over and crazy enough, especially now the "severe" series of films as 007 and Mission Impossible comedy itself includes as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems more intended for children than for adults, and the terrible disaster of Johnny English is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the personality Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret spyner network on the web, making known the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain, to great disgrace of the agent in function, unfortunately a small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the emmer run over from the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terriblely unpopular as politics. Emma Thompson is doing her best with this personality that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she must use a retired spy, since each active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as schoolmaster in a chic institution, but gives inofficial lesson about undercoverwork. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the English spy lessons are thinking about School of Rock.
English is quickly available on Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former sad help Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and joviale role that lies under Vicki Pepperdines level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, unfortunately, the Prime Minister falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billions who claim to be able to solve the British computer problems: the champion Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin with their odyssee of clever doll fun: dressed as obers they burn a delicious French restaurant, they spare herrie on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English encouraging pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make themselves familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last, all registers are opened, but no matter how well-intentional and sturdy the scene is, they are doing something to think of child television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: Can the British film sector really not think of a role that is honoring the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British work four days a week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan where Brits work four days a week but get paid for five days.
It is said that the party would want the managers of companies to pass the savings they make as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) by giving them an additional day holiday.
Thus workers can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn as much.
According to sources, the idea is fitting in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to get the balance of the country into the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week has already been approved by the Association of Facilities, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘Awaiting a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at one time at the other, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to increase the balance in the economy to the benefit of workers and that also fits within the total industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party who supports such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the full Labour Party does not support the effort at the moment.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "sightless drivers" and the "professors" in use companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get the full value of their share, because a Labour government could apply 'declines' on the basis of observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of businesses and to set up including property funds (Included Ownership Funds) providing 10% of the shares of private enterprises to employees that can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his nomination before the Supreme Court with at least one week delayed and asks whether the findings of the FBI might allow Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, the voice of Graham seems to be walled.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamit," he said.
"For Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one called by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see new developments."
What is the Global Citizens Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizens Festival is organised in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will occur on stars and a as impressive mission knows: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: to end extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting this.
Concert visitors who want to obtain a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteer work, a world leader emails, a telephone conversation, or in another meaningful way generate awareness for the purpose: an end of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizens Festival been to go with 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people of demanding a call for action or is this just a different form of 'clicktivism', giving people the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
According to Global Citizens, more than 19 million 'activities' of supporters have been registered since 2011, aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and have made policy proposals for more than $37 billion which have to change life of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or collected by sponsor actions.
The group estimates that so far the funds obtained have had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the main intention declarations is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of 'helping children to achieve their full potential'. This group promised 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end undernutrition in the country after they had received more than 4.700 seconds from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, of donors, of other national authorities and of Global Citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions have been sent in order to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that 5 million women and children will reach with nutrition interventions.
In answer to one of the frequent questions on the Global Citizen's website, which asked "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The group answered: "It will be a long and difficult way, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-partity movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will take place this year during the New York event presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the navy for a 'blockade' to impair Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" take refuge to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, including in the Middle East, declared Ryan Zinke, the US Minister for Inland Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts on the invitation of the legal government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the Southern Flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counteract this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the navy, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not marketed," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited persons during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit targets that varies themselves as the 'the voice of the energy consumer' in the US.
He went further and compared Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these were not significantly different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is little or more to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows a 'art' with a economy depending on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For that reason, officials of the government of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw view from the 'unqualified' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made the 'catched' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, at the value of $11 billion which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition against the project is sent only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has led to a reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its involvement in the project again.
The Federal Association of Deutschen Industries (BDI), the leading industrial organization in Germany, called on the US to avoid interference with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a major problem when a third power involves our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federal Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she was "thinkin' about" to take part in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed her thinking about it to participate in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6, I'm going to think seriously about it to make me preferable as president."
Warren runs against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump brings in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for a FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, a Thursday opinion study revealed that a majority of Warren's adherences believe that it should not be elected in 2020.
Fifty-five percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty - twenty percent of them were for her to be preferred.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% before a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other names of prominent democrats linked to possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Prayer said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and accused after a message of domestic violence on Monday night.
"Through what my own son must experience, what he experiences now when he is back, I understand other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers return" she told the audience attended at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and their harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims flying for gang violence or for domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. submitted a statement last Friday as 'friend-of-the-hof' to the Washington Court in support of an asylum seeker who combats this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the case of Grace versus Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union advocated against federal policy in August has not been announced.
She says that her partner has abused her "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" but that U.S. officials have rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people applying asylum in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has turned back a decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals from 2014, where it was possible for immigrants without documents flying for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the advocate-General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international legislation for tens of years".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" in the statement of the 'friend-of-the-hof'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy that denies access to the United States to immigrants damages the US economy, since these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'foreseen the necessary labour forces'.
Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, in June ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view," said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to lighten all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people are dealing every day, all over the world.
Missile rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also became worse.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her fevery baby in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their ruined houses and searched for valuable things they could still use in their doornight possessions.
Hundreds of people have injured and the hospitals are overpopulated, as far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe nascocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added this to his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and to our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accused China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertisements'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China were highlighted, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid Annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interference in the US Congress elections of 6 November, a accusation denied by China.
Trumps accusation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the elections in the United States, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a rising campaign by Washington to impress China.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war, in which they have made each other increasingly higher import rates.
China's remuneration rates were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states as Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China and formerly governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and companies.
"China," as Branstad wrote in a opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "is now doubled the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long-coursed tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find abnormal voices at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing and will not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese population can have about the difficult economic route, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as did he not say to which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh Debacle, the Republicans exposed female voters from themselves just before the interim elections, warning analytists
Now that many important Republicans are arriving around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analytists warn that they will experience a relapse, especially among women, during the coming interim elections.
The emotions about this topic have risen enormously, and most Republicans have already informed that they want to continue to vote.
"These things can't be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for a article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake (Republicein, Arizona)'s attempt to ask for a FBI investigation will be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they have not forgotten it tomorrow and they have not forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called on "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the hall of the Senate, while the Republicans who were controlled by the Justice Committee chose to approve the candidate of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," told Stu Rothenberg, an inpartial political analytist, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among floating female voters in the outskirts and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, which often do not vote, even if they do not agree with the president."
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analytists suggested that if the Republicans were to persist in the appointment, they could follow a relapse.
"This has become a confusing punishment for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican Party, earlier weekly, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote in the committee, or the final vote, or Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but it is also about the way the Republicans have handled this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities of the United States, makes a group that helps democratics to be chosen clear to the news channel.
The Americans, however, prove to be divided about the question who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority represents the side of the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41 percent of the respondents surely believe the testimony of Ford and that 35 percent surely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh was probably lying during his witness while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the suggestion of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford declared to the Senate Justice Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of drink when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party in the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new Internet to handle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that "world rule" is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
In this, lists of contacts, activities lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal power by means of data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, developers of technology worldwide can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation which means that all their business models are put on their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Honoured spiritual and carryer of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, President Bernard Vann made the distinction on 29 September 1918 as a result of the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was 'brilliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his batalion on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick mist and under heavy fire of field shoots and machine guns".
Later he stormed to the fire line and led the line forward before he ran only to a field shoot and switched off three members of the detention.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something, which I know I can never type on it, but also something that makes me humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt that he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade, and added that "the braveness of a real hero is demonstrated by the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed all night to see Bellator 206 and received Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to look at a follow-up Bellator 206 and you're getting the most important moment not to see.
The San Jose annex listed 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were prepared for their fights, watchers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake for this struggle all night.
A fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"According to the rules of the government, after 6:00 a.m., no more content should be displayed that is not suitable for children, so we had to switch to the child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
""Peppa has pig," yess."
Scott Coker, Vice-President of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the return match, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the change, there went a lot of texts and believe me, these weren't all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen second time.
We restrict the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's a unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleanser Tom Daley says he felt underferior during his youth because of his sexual attitude, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-five-five-year-old said he didn't realize that 'not everyone is like I am' until he went to the continuing education.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that parenting had contributed to the less value of winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presentation of the long-run show has taken a few months free because of disease.
Apparently as a shift on the first programme of Laverne, Daley told him that during his youth he felt "lesser" than others because it was "socially not accepted to enjoy both girls and boys".
He said: "To this day, those feelings, feelings of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'some' so he wouldn't disappoint people if they eventually discovered his nature.
The winner of two bronzes Olympic medals has become an outstanding campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence in the Common Beast Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has surprised me completely".
Daley married the Oscarwinner, who is 20 years older than he last year, but said that the difference in age had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much young," he took part in his first Olympic Games at 14 years and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same height and low points.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "hele perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a golden medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you'll be no more to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breath was actually stabbed and he died, I finally could acknowledge that he was not inconquered," he said.
The following year Daley joined the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life. To dip for a home public during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on the way to the games and where he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, on the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form to find back to not make a sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who participates for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and four-somes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practising on the driving range, in an attempt to find out what it is.
Because he was never known at the top of his career for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs misleading balls is routineously punished.
And if the job in itself is not awkward enough, Mickelson comes in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches well start, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has proved to be trusted in this man, even if he could be fairly difficult to change.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on my back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furike.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had expected more of it, but it's the way it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely equated the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Furyk said that his presence had an insistible influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to get out fun with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy sometimes last week, that was fun to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows out of experience that the comfortable advance before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made its debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with the captain of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advance on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advance in Valderrama; we had a great advance in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, here, after he had seen the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 advance on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go on and carry out the plan on the right.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy winning, and we need to keep focusing on that.
I continue to say, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Enjoyed with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with business in this area.
Tomorrow, a new challenge is awaiting.
Tomorrow, the individual performance will come on, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be working out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you stand alone, your capabilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So let your partner go now and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to be individually better than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this kind of turning on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had highlighted his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the curve tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We voted our line-up on this and send the men on the road in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're trying to magic something from the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the counter-offensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we have been so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is delayed again
The latest fregat of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014, in order to replace the older warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the glossy new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper The Time that a military speaker quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plowed the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aged fregates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know they have a powerful cannon, a series of air-defence and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to set up the latest fregates up to two years afterwards, far away from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to give Germany the opportunity to project its power overseas, are already obsolete at the time they are taken into operation, notes that time.
The fatal fregat F125 has already taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German marine officially refused to drive the ship and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was put into a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, half the manpower on the fregates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship has a serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and limit the maritime capacity to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class in the Second World War by the Germans.
In addition to the defected hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a dizzinessing €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest fregates become particularly important because of recent warnings that the power of the German Navy declines.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of Parliamentary Defence Committee in Germany, acknowledged that the marine actually has "a deficit of operational ships".
The official said that the problem has grown over time as a snowball, because old ships were taken out of operation but no substitute vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of baths
New research carried out on a landscape in the Scotian highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that findings will bring new light to the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwerg bat, the brown big ear Mouse and the water bat at Invereve Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the landings to follow the activities of the baths through the season.
Workers of the NTS and volunteers are also going to carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the screaming of the bath and what kind of what is doing.
Then a map of the habitat and a report is produced to make such a detailed image on landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for baths and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pasture fields and how to maintain forests best for baths and similar species.
Fleermouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping places and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, like flying catches and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by home cats.
Fleer Mouses are in fact not blind.
By their nightly hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
At the NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares on land in the country, baths are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, inspect sleeping places and sometimes carry out rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the landscape Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of baths live in Scotland.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for the baths.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for baths," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about butterflies not yet known, so the work we do here and on other locations will help us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the importance of the control of bats before maintenance work is carried out, because the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boys, which may cause a complete local population to be eradicated.
Butterflies are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall into trouble, to disturb or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Schots official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn a lot about our butterflies and about many of our species we simply don't know how they're doing with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of assault while his lawyers are ready to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualified as 'fair news' and said people want 'to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German weekly paper Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to silence about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video for his 142 million followers at Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, several hours after the accusations were reported, the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to become famous by calling my name, but that's part of the field.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good" the footballer added to this, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing a trial in which they want to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called "an inappropriate report of suspects in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wishes to compensate for the 'moral damage to a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The supposed incident was supposed to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite from the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met each other in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the room of the footballer, where he raped her according to the accusation, as readable in the complaint submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the supposed incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and that he told her he was a "good guy" for '99 percent' but that he is sometimes left behind that "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the few have had sex, but that this was with mutual approval.
Mayorga also claims that she has gone to the police and that her injuries have been photographed in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial arrangement because she was "bang for the consequences" and because she was worried about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to declare the scheme invalid because it has been permanently traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was on the point of going from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed assault and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in an agreement at a value of €100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as car manufacturers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret forever' if it loses its status as world leader in auto-production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Great Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no-deal' job would cost.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota were made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that when Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory stopping," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of a EU exit without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already informed that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota is based on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, whereby every 37 minutes components of suppliers in the UK and in the EU arrive for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, anxiety can break out at the limits that industry can lead to delays and shortcomings of components.
Toyota cannot store more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, so the company informed, and in that case, production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'exactly agreed to avoid those checks at the border'.
"We must have an agreement. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4 Today program.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue with this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not tell how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is representative of the trade association Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs have lost, they will never return.
A public spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the adjunct prosecutor-general Rod Rosenstein can be delayed for another week while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who researchs the Russian influence of elections, links between assistants of Trump and Russia and possible obstacles to the President's trial.
The question whether Trump will dismiss the adjunct-advocate general and thereby endanger the independence of Mueller, the Washington robbery machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to establish conversations with Trump and to discontinue the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors made the round that he was about to submit his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to kick Rosenstein 'night', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misbehavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would be witnessing.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to carry out a week's investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which slowed down the vote in the full Senate again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the prince of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asking for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be delayed another week, given all the other things that are in progress with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters have had difficulties with this claim: Sanders have not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarceness of press conferences was not caused by a disgrace of the "conscious" TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President is doing more questions and answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without proof of this, "We have viewed the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do so much and you have seen us do that often over the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitarians on visit.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Healthcare Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the desire that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already declared themselves willing to carry the costs of the application of a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
However, at the same time, the government of the UK has also swooped the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for you all.
I would therefore like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and outside, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing a rapid surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers' line baker, Christion Abercrombie, had been under an emergency operation yesterday after he had a head injury in the 31-27 lost race against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, reported that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline, and sucked there a little or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie directly oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the surgery room in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still no details about the type/dividence of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was totally traped five times on Saturday before leaving the field, so that he was ticked 18 times this season.

This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success to attract young voters.
The increase of the leaks shall be charged on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to spend £120 million a year in order to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leaks when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable houses and stories on merchants.
The increase in the leakage is paid to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, whereby the additional yield is squeezed in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The contribution, which comes above the current physicians, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to reach up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the United Kingdom. This is why prices are driven up and it is difficult for launchers to get a foot on the leather.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically "spook cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleased for a reduction in the leaks to help young people buy their first house.
He accused large construction companies to keep the prices high by buying land and not using this and he called on May to cancel quotas on remunerable houses to restore the 'residential shame' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced an outstanding series of housing reforms, including lease ceilings and an end of exemption 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "I said last year that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister on the restoration of the 'British Dream', that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard working British inhabitants.
For too many people, the dream of ever possessing a house has become a too vacuum dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head has already been too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's the ultimate ambition of ever becoming the manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reliving the club from the northeast of England, which is currently on the third place in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after bringing back the previous season of St Mirren to the Scottish Prime Ministership.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was elected for the B team and thereby the coast was off" said Ross to Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I often saw playing with my father Scotland in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps on dressing me.
However, that option would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Atletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is currently measured by 'Can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, this should no doubt be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years working with his career as manager, after a period as a assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to the winning of the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a cross point," he remembered the time when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well, I deserved quite well and knew a few reasonable highlights.
But footballs can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're faced with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and the pressure of the craft, but management just feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm so well in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has increased the income of British pubs who have hard to survive but also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but the incomes in restaurants were 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and the fact that England took longer than expected part in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 per cent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants became even harder now.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June only became worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at drink sales achieved far from the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs also aimed at sale of food members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people only wanted to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drink turnover was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while food turnover was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analytics for the recreational and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outdoor market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a turnover fall of 4.8 per cent in the year is particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators who focused on food and will only learn the time if the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary feedback."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a common turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One out of five children has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from their parents.
One out of five children, some not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, that they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Inquiry under 20,000 secondary school students revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One out of five children, some not older than 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that they hid from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference) of independent schools discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half allowed to keep up personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are intrigued to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'the voice of the athlete' in the Scottish athlete's board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Council of the Scottish athlete world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland at work and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the managers of the sports to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athlete in Scotland will benefit enormously from its election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve for the athletes and I hope I can make a contribution and help control the sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the Games of 1996 in Atlanta, two of his four golden Olympic Medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn whether I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which sucking mothers are compared to cows that are mixed.
To mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silently carryable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired advertising on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to colling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shirt filled with hoy on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see of it' and 'If you didn't watch it, these are no yachts, these are my breasts'.
The refreshing continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, where many people say that in this, the 'horror' of the milk industry is recompensated.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be expected to get and be born to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after birth" is written in a reaction.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreet in a nutrition beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said, "This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another one added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I still had breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for too much.
This is a genius product," somebody wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny advertising, aimed at mothers that cows (usually at work or in a toilet) and then feel like being 'cows'.
This ad does not seem positive or negative to the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their behas.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who cows sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a nutrition beha, so that women have the freedom to move, to hold their babies, and even to go out while they are cumbering.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is a so revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between collating mothers and milk cows, we wanted to put the collision and the associated challenges in the shields and at the same time show in a maintenance and understandable way how the new pump will make an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of prisoned migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly borders has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-fighting retorics and the hard-fighted policies introduced by the Government of Trump make it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and they are afraid to risk their own chance of remaining in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as sponsor for unmade minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested persons had no preliminary penalty paper.
"Only 80 percent of those who are sponsors or relatives of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We are persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, making some of them obliged to appear before the court within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will stand before the court through a video conference instead of personally, in order to appeal to their application of a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for help will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance that they become anxious or depressed, which can cause violent outbreaks or flight attempts, according to the employees at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child fights are more often ignored due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare for this emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, can contribute to the trauma that many of them are still struggling with.
Syria recommends the U.S., France and Turkey's 'occupied force' to withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Walid Al-Muallem also called upon to return the Syrian refugees even now that the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, also vice-premier, said that the foreign troops are illegally located on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that 'it will be handled accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced and displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian areas" from terror groups and from "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly working on training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the land broken by war.
As regards refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he refused to "distribute irrational fears" to the most refugees.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicians of a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid available to Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations Diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important ballwork of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political discussions.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has a major attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement knows "exact deadlines" and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including warriors of the Nusra Front, which are "to be destroyed".
Mr Staffan de Mistura, the UN Member, hopes to convene the first sitting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to design a constitution for after the war for Syria and to facilitate the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should restrict itself to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidentship is prematurely ended by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever'.
At present, however, there are no signs of sight - tiredness.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time specimen have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost trifolded to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at night with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC Drama "Designed Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He then said, 'Because he makes me laugh," said Scovell to me.
There's a value of entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to all the other on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disable is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you see that you've been watching a panel experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', who are talking about the jack of pauw learning of Paul Manafort that cost $15,000 (a clothing full of excess, according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
Anyway, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he does to give you the idea that it's about a reality show, is partly that he stops you with something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role sharing of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a fight on the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea you're behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees out of his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he opened CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear to the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all these strange shows, not so long ago, and that people said "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it shows that they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Delegateds
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flux of money, thanks to a reconciliation of an electoral district which requires two sitting national representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently revised district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired its seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who knows a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January considered that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('grommanding') to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a crack party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (NRCC) (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a victory in a well-viewed special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for aid to China and rejected it.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to call back the US Heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the ministerial spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishments were considered only in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million from US aid in 2017, for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with great unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials presented a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up at a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from leaving to the United States.
But half September some top officials from the government told them that they wanted the conference to continue, thus making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a talk at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance of the government assigns to the meeting, says diplomats.
And the three U.S. messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages about Washington's penalties.
A spokesman of the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analytist who is also close to the government and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of Trump's justice, for which heavy evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is probably also going to focus his research on collaboration between the campaign of Trump and Russia in a Russian attack on our elections.
If the Congress change color, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is ready to turn back to the voters, and maybe he should go to account for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of deliberations, and I would not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable or that of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and had supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed, which followed.
The course of history is about such bending points and the unfair emergence of democracy will be accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently faced with various of this kind of bow points.
What will we do if Trump adjunct prosecutor Rod Rosenstein releases the man who has the fate of the investigation of Mueller?
Rosenstein is in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested to take up conversations with the president secretly and that he had speculated about the suitability of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says the report of The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the new requested investigation by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if it is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and an unfair witness?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I think we will not fail by the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassadors home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and sent me, 60 years later, away to climb candles before the Sabbath on the table on which a swastic was represented.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans by Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive equality in Spain against Villarreal this month, a victory on the Austrians places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a kneeblessure, the middle fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first race from the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers who can use rash as a jump board for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We joined the match with the idea that something to win was dropped and came out the match with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but over the whole game, a equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
The coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it is going to be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I am sure we can continue and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been difficult, of all that happened to my blessings and the changes in the club itself, but now a feeling-good factor hangs on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now persist, leave the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide research said they were talking to their wives about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps needed to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your wife(o)t(e) and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in your arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenses.
Your long-term funding choices, including a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use your own assets as insurance as long as you have money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is required.
Take care of full power for health care, so that you can designate a trusted person that can overlook your medical care and ensure that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate anymore.
Consider also a full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and to ensure that the invoices are paid if you are not able to do this.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother hitting a medical emergency and on the way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan so you can have the information in hand.
"It's not only the financial affairs of interest, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
Man several times shot with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure gun when he walked home after a night.
The victim, forty plus, was located in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was touched in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shipment, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death number will increase further.
Since communications have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Regentschaft Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evakuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami sought.
Donggala is a rainy that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Célebes, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nikkel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis in the last hundred years according to the Agency for the fight against disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also smote in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on the north of Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that has hit 14 countries and has a total of 226.000 lives in Atjeh along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of it.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a power of 6.8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that swallowed on the south coast and almost 700 life.
2009: A earthquake of 7.6 on the scale of Richter met the city Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: A earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the scale of Richter met one of the Mentawai Islands, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: An immense earthquake hit the rainfall Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, because people were reminded of the destructions of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people found death through devastating buildings.
2018: Multiple earthquakes found the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and ensured that thousands of tourists were temporarily strayed.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-presidency, was arrested on charge of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, infringement of a report of domestic violence and opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female famous person tried to call the police to report the claimed crimes, he took off her phone.
Palin is held in arrest in the house of storage Mat-Su with a guarantee of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, surely" when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is accused of three infringements of class A, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged for a infringement of class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017 he was accused of being mistreated by his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the suspected abuse.
This case now serves for the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of mistreatment in the home atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after linking her son’s violent conduct to PTSS, that he would have kept his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after a earthquake met the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 in the scale of Richter has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the expectation is that the death number will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
Videos are circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sajfollo Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight persons were killed, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a rented truck from Home Depot to run an attack on a cycling path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he ran footgängers and cyclists who came on his road in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov has deliberately killed the eight victims and has deliberately caused serious physical injuries, according to the intention declaration in which the death penalty is required, which has been submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both accusations, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the charge of 22 accusations, including eight accusations of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a accusation of violentness and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'wearful, cruel and corrupted'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsch Sajpov has injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the intention declaration.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York, a case in which the death penalty was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after they had been sentenced two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, originating in Uzbekistan, did not prove a repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told the detectives that he felt good about his action, including the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not complain to be guilty of the charge of 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was 'of course disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of debt in exchange for a lifelong penalty without a possibility of liberation, will only extend the trauma of these events for all the stakeholders," said Patton.
The defense of Sajpov had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative Member says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a 'volksarge' during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptics, while one of the own members of Theresa May proposed to lead him to negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that if Mr Farage Brexit had been minister, the United Kingdom would be out.
However, the challenge to which May is faced in the reconciliation of the strongly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep its Chequers compromise on the ride while it is attacked by Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Colleagues maintained that she would continue and would try to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the contradictions, thus force Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to throw "Chequers in the carpet".
He suggested that Farage should be scattered and the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels should be given.
"If he made the service, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The parliamentary member of Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the carpet."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be understood.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected suggestions that the public opinion had been changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British population has changed its opinion and wants to remain in the EU is completely untrue."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the March and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the great public, the opposition is not for votes, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are chosen.
Let Chequers drop and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heat' if they wanted to betray the decision taken in the referendum of 2016.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say, "We don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put the fire to our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and concluded this March with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists swinged with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Superior House, was joking about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plants to think well about the candidate for presidentship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll start thinking well about her candidate for the presidentship after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican delegate who was co-president of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she may be going to fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendant asked her if she would prefer the presidentship.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told us Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, basketball player of LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video of the shooting accident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died from its consequences," said police officer Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been inquired and has known in the place to have been present, in possession of a gun and Wayde Sims shot down.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 metres grown up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a part in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost put Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Bolt to attack his teammate.
Fettle went into the pitch and left Hamilton in the pressured drives in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the pitches and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action, allowing the Ferrari rider to release space with opposition at the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Versstapen started from the last place and was the seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he remained with his band choice and made a quick finish, so that he could pick Kimi Raikkonen up for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the pits, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, he was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team has done its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That was not a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday on the fact that she did not remain the source of the written letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
At a election meeting in West Virginia, the president had not spoken directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee, but he noted that what took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, unfair and untrue'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and common and unfair and untrue," he said.
"When you look at the press messages and the leaks and that they then say "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer, you picked the document - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak" he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July the letter in which the accusations to the address of Kavanaugh were mentioned were sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidently to go, and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president did not believe her denial and he commented at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Furthermore, with his defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misbehavior, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the commonness, the unkindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to drive about to grab the power and get the control back," the president would have said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had named with two goals the leadership of scores by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen with two goals secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a restraint on Friday evening to defeat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
In the fourth minute at 3:35, Dwyer's opening gate came on a assistant from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the front, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the suggestion for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants entered the first rest with a front, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a equal stand with a power-play-gall at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He provided the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while he ensures that hundreds of people escape the earthquake in a plane
A air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a hundreds of people could travel safely on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been missing after a heavy earthquake has hit the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful nascocks still harass the area and many are buried under the point of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild and weather moving traffic stations of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in order to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was at that time ready for the startway, could be safely lifted.
Then he was bounced out of the traffic storms when he thought it was incremental.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart, when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death rate may rise to the thousands and inform the Agency for the fight against disasters of the country that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"There is assumed that the number of deaths continues to rise because many bodies were under ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral celebration will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and stocks.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The small markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Indonesia had been affected by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people lived.
Air Niugini says now that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The air carrier that run the flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the singed plane.
Air Niugini said in a press report that is missing one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped to save the other passengers and crew members, after the plane had been watered during the landing on the airport of the Chuukia countries.
The authorities announced that seven people had been brought to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the landing track.
Some witnesses believe that the plane was shot over the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told us that he and some others managed to wage the water, which came to their means, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were panicing and screaming and that he had a non serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that seafarers who were working in a yard nearby also helped in the rescue work by bringing people to the coast before the plane continued to sink into about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Security Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of air carriers registered at the PNG, but that none of them relates to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his requisitoir on Friday in the reopening process of a man who is accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analytist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, issued a single hourly witness as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the phone call data to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left her life.
Rowlett told me that he had received the location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police began talking to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis to speak the truth when he told him he was in Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was then in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile telephone data indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that a while after the death of Chambers, Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What's 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative imago of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol says that hiphop is alienated from the origin of political opinions and the maping of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artiests such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a new experience in Great Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A childwife from New York makes a couple before the right because of a 'racist' text
A childwife from New York makes a couple before the court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother complained about 'there' such a black one.
The couple refuses to be racist and calls the case "expressing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her grief when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroide woman when she met her first day in 2016.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she would send it to Mrs Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper The New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman Mrs. Maurice, when she realized her blunder, declared that her former childwife, which was Afro-American, had done bad work, and that she therefore had expected a Philippine.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple for the court to get a compensation of $350,- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to hire the family internally, though without a contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that," says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding to it, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fir Maurice after, by insulting her, she was afraid that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here.
Comparing the case with 'depressing', Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Will you persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic', the investment banker added it.
While the case is still in progress, the public opinion is quick to capture the couple on social media, where it is ceased for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a speaking bear, reveals newly opened letter
Alliance's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington's huge success, it's very easy."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the child book about a small toy bear, when cameraman worked at the British Sender BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be disapproved. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bittersoet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so vital to him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud while you didn't do anything for it.
I think he experienced about Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination ability, he honored the bear himself for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her via the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected she wouldn't get it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then the call from Nad came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye from her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping became slow and left her body.
She died for a while before, and this process turned everything out.
I could just sit there, knowing what's going on.
I couldn't swear, cry or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I really had to keep myself great."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning about her daughter's death, stepped in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to face.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I was sitting down with my head and the tears remained coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Roading women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide are strong to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and dwelling in Lydney, Gloucestershire, says that her son was a promising boss cook with an intimidating grin.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there is a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis made the cards, "to let people know that there are others you can go to and what you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up, talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad or depressed or something like that," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was totally on the ground on First Christmas - when the children picked up their gifts, he didn't look at them at all or so."
She said that his death was a big trauma before her, but that they have to process it, "It'll break the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to continue and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain while FBI research starts
"I thought that if we could actually get for one another what he asks; a research limited in time and size, then we might be able to create more unit again," said Mr Flake last Saturday, which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was 'committed' in the middle of a firmly anchored patch within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been seriously difficult in five weeks, on 6 November and, as expected, when the Republicans do bad, their efforts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called on members of the U.S. Senate to lobby Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who was the Bush his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes the report?
Then there is a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 Democrats sitting.
It is not clear yet that Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to deliver the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court.
Number of survivors in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawyer, the number of North Korean survivors has decreased to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sugh, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Uniwording, declares that there were 1.127 survivors last year, compared to 2 7006 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China and higher punishment for smugglers are the key factors for decline.
Pyongyang hasn't responded publicly.
The large majority of North Korean overflowers are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of Korean war in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make it easier to cross than in the heavy-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreans.
China considers the survivors as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often turns them off with violence.
The relations between North and South, which are still formally able to fight, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, mainly on the denuclarisation negotiations.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed largely to work to the nuclear demantration of the Korean peninsula
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in repealing US penalties since then.
Mr Ri said during a speech for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, 'without faith in US action, there is also no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament'.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him uncomfortable to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Delegateds, Nancy Pelosi, referred to as "hysterical" for the United States Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and finds him unable to serve in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help think that if a woman was to behave like this, it would be called her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Committee for Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotionate; he at times screamed almost and was especially disturbed when he told about his family and his high school time.
He also strongly condemned the democratics in the committee, calling the accusations against him "large and coordinated character murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to set up a distortion procedure against Kavanaugh if he was to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Delegateds.
"I can say this about; if he does not tell the truth at the Congress, or to the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now serving," Pelosi declared.
Kavanaugh is currently judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually shortened D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she was concerned that Kavanaugh would come to speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the Law on Payable Health) because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions on the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the hearings of confirmation.
"Don't expect us to stand to rejoice if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court", says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a fair tirade of months and years of crushed anger that runs over, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere and who told her that she was going to cry when she became angry. She developed a method, where she began to cry when she became angry. To the one she then spoke to, she said, "You might think I'm sad, because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just cryed further.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially allowed as expressions of anger, because crying becomes essentially unbelievable.
One of my best remaining memories from a former job, in a office dominated by men, was when I had to cry because I was enormously angry. An elderly woman, a dead business leader who everyone was a little scared of, grabbed me in my necklace and swooped me into a staircase house.
"Don't show them you're crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidate for presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an outer maritime affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catting wheat' or 'ape stroke') and withdrawn from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not make a candidate for herself.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already been advanced, she was behind with fund recruitment, so she promised not to be involved if she couldn't spend $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give a thousand dollars to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she held her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism - that she was caught in it.
'There will have been thought that I had a nervous sinking', Mrs Schroeder reminded her about how the media responded to her.
"They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my grave stone?
"She cryed?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can take advantage of Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the United States and China were obsolete, and although the struggle has not yet been struggled for a long time, a gap between the two countries, according to experts in the long term, could be favorable for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US President, gave earlier this year the first warning by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week became known when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion euros) to goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken in natural represales every time, most recent by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion of US goods.
China has promised to equate the United States every time, and the world's world will probably not blink quickly with the eyes.
In order to make Washington bow, requests must be accepted, but public bowling for the US is much too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that when Beijing plays smartly, it would be possible to support the trade war with the United States, China in the longer term, by decreasing mutual dependency of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which could cause one of the two countries to fall into a economic free fall, is actually far more dangerous than watchers have recognized before," says Abigail Grace, a research colleague of the 'Center for a New American Security', a thought tank specialized in national security issues that focus on Asia.
Syria 'free' to allow refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says he will be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the land that has been destroyed by a more than seven years of war.
In his speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that the conditions in his country would improve.
'The situation at present is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,' he says.
The government continues rehabilitation of areas destroyed by terrorists and normalising the local situation.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures threatening their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to restore the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries who had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the 'Le Golf National' golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and the Ryder Cup has no longer won in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn team achieved the required number of 14,5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the entire tournament, made his long hit from the tea landing in the water at pair 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shouted in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever received 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest classed player on the World Range List, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who might have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I was able to help', said a emotioned Garcia after the European victory.
He passs the facility to his landmate, John Ram, who took the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride I feel because I hit Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The American commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they have struggled.
We have made Europe a little more difficult this morning.
We made opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the US PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud that I can be their captain.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overwhelmed."
Red gloed update: Concentrations decrease in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Vis and Fauna) shows a general decrease in concentrations of Red gloed in parts of Tampa Bay Area (located on the western coast of Florida in the United States).
According to the committee, reports are reported on fragmentary increases in the red glow in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red glow ranges over an average of 200 km coastline, from north Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are approximately 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but at less places than last week.
Red has also been seen glowfully in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations have been reported for the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations for the Hillsborough County coast, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or outside the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at Lee County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
It is permanently reported on the irritation of the airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, there was no mention of irritation of the airways in the last week.
