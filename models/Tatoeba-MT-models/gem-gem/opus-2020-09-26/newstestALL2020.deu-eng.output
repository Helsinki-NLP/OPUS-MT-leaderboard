Fire in French chemistry deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant that was particularly dangerous in the Northern French city of Rouen is deleted. This informed the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broken out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 cars.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were called for not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the coast of Seine are manufactured additives for butterfly. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people work. In the past, the chemistry factory provided headlines - for example, when a leak broke the gas methanthil and the environment smoked far after faul eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flooded into the city's wastewater system.
Woman announces her job to look for her lost dog 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old borderer Collie had run away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the dog was missing any trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie was disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put a dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere at the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately out. Probably a loud thunder had moved the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days on, "I have never given up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as a postman to continue their search for Katie.
"Flowing the Tears"
57 days after Katies disappeared, Carole King got a call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his courtyard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared. She searched the neighborhood and suddenly she stood her dog under a tree. "I just had to embrace her. I didn't want to let her go," King remembered, according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flood. The people kept on in their vehicles, stuck out and embraced us. I believe the whole neighborhood knew we had found them."
Losses in the Federal Defense: Machinery weapons disappear without trace
Friday 27 September 2019
Six machine weapons of type MG3 are still disappeared.
In recent years, the federal army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition, including three machine guns. The remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frighting" scale.
In the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition are always disappearing - many of them have not been trackless until now. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 shots ammunition. This is a list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which the redaction network reports Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one arms part and 3474 shot ammunition have been reappeared. Among the still disappeared weapons and arms parts, there are six machine weapons of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. Additionally, 30 gun pipes for MG3 machines are missing.
The range of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal army was "awning," said the left-speaking Martina Renner. This was so much more because, in the course of investigations, little was found again. The left politician spoke of a "necessary balance". Renner criticized that the list was unrecognized whether under the disappeared ammunition also the ones who were found in connection with the investigations against the federal weather officer Franco A. who suspected to be found. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanks "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after his settlement by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today. As ship observation data were shown by Refinitely, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was specified in the United Arab Emirates as a target port.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. The shipping was called to wait for an official message from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" had been imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolution Gardens in the Sea Road of Hormuz to have violated security provisions. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar belonging to Great Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have increased enormously over the past months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There have been several incidents with tanks and drones.
Merkel deserves the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel deserved the commitment of the people in the DDR who went to the street at the peaceful revolution 30 years ago. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens would have brought the former DDR regime to wake, Merkel said at a festival of the Thüringer CDU Group on the coming day of the German Unit in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded the Occupation of the Stasi Center. "The state security was taken to the horrors," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas Quarteral may keep record ready. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the Electronic Auto Corporation.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car corporation with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter of 100,000 deliverys," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks round letters. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered up to 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be achieved in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are small profit margins. Despite the tree's last losses.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't cite ourselves
A type of brake in the large brain prevents people from citing themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments to rats, as they informed on Thursday evening. It also made progress in the question why children are so strongly opposed to the kitling, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the approach to a kitling hand triggers laughs before touching. This is on a deep layer in the large brain, which already triggers laughing at the expectation of the kittle.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats respond with "laughing" in the ultrasonic area when they are cited by humans. This "laugh" is provided by the part of the whole brain corn, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-behavior
Until now, it has been assumed that the brain between self-behavior and touching can differ from others - so people can not cit themselves. The Berliner researchers now found at the experiments at the rats that laughing as well as the activity of the area concerned of the large-shirn rims are undermined during a self-behavior. This is also the case when living beings put themselves. During the foreign touch and the quetzle by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and the impulse has been strengthened.
However, if the self-concerning and touching occurs by others at the same time, if laughing is also suppressed, this indicates that the brain of the rat could just not distinguish between self-behavior and touching by others. The new findings made it clear that people cannot climb themselves because self-behavior enables a brake in the large brain.
The rats have also been trained to cite themselves, so they broke off this initiative in the experiment sometimes, showed escape behaviour or terrible stars. This ambivalence is similar to the behavior of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzel is a behavior reaction that is the same in rats and people.
Disaster disappeared: Big fire in French chemistry deleted
The big fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the Northern French city of Rouen is deleted. This shared the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken out in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no health hazardous substances were exposed. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. Nobody was injured in the event. The fire force was in use with about 200 cars.
Schools and children's gardens were closed
Inhabitants were invited not to leave their homes. buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliardaire Warren Buffett
In the chemistry at the Ufer of Seine, additives for butterfly are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliardaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemistry factory has already provided for headlines in the past - for example, when a leak broke the gas methanthil and the environment far after faulty eggs smoked. In 2015, after an operational accident, some 2000 litres of mineral oil flood into the city's wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on the speech of Boris Johnson at the first sitting in Parliament following the abolition of the forced break on Wednesday evening, but the Prime Minister threatens to carry the country out of the EU on 31 October without agreements, Brussels should not accept his demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but as he wants to achieve it is unclear.
Concerning Cox, who had served the remaining United Kingdom in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memorial of Jo Cox and return to this country would be to carry out the EU exit." Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election campaign by a legal extremist.
Meal for attacks by Oslo and Utöya is disclosed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a meal is revealed in Norway on Saturday to honor the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose imitations. They recall the roses of thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the judgment in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now revealed - the roses were formed by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. It is expected to be opened among other Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprinze Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first burned an autobomb in the government district of Oslo and, following the island of Utöya, thousands of participants in a holiday camp of the Youth Organization of the Social Democratic Worker Party were shot. A total of 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanks
The UN General debate brought no solution in Iran's conflict, but now there's a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could return to lake. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of the Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk ship informed.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now traveling for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Redreichef Erik Hånell. At noon the ship left the Iranian waters. "Bay that it is over," he said to the Swedish TV station SVT.
The London Foreign Ministry referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution Gardens had already released the tanker on 19 July under the preliminary preliminary ruling to disregard the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members would have definitely enjoyed the circumstances, said Hånell. They had been professional in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipping work now to bring them back together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: There was a supertanker of oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, put to the chain behind the establishment of the "Stena Impero". According to EU sanctions against the war country Syria, the ship had been sent to the British.
Iran spoke of "piraterie" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutations that it was a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" free, reflected London's feement.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have increased enormously over the past months. Trade shipping has been brought into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There have been several incidents with tanks and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear struggle of both countries stands. The Americans are proposing for the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran has rejected this. The United States have been in the entrance of 2018 from the international nuclear agreement, which prevents Iran from building a nuclear bomb and should end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US Government has put the lead in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more strict and extended agreement. Iran resists the pressure so far.
Because of the struggle about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the USA is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for safety and peace in the street of Hormus at the United Nations Full Assembly in New York. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran, with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection forces, wanted to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is developing a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner". In view of the penalty that the American President Donald Trump has committed against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to dispose of. Financial heads of Asian companies who consider to place their production from China into another country call India in a survey by the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has, of course, not only been done with the inconsistencies of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pole of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created to play a significant role in the globally deviated production chain.
But now India itself has been found in Trump's focus. From the Haudegen in the Weissen House, declared "Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The United States prohibits high duties and requires better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rippers with India are freely representing a nearby scene. In addition, America views the world's largest democracy also through security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington connect the concern about China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In this context, a salve of American punishment against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has just entered a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened these that open markets accelerate economic development, has a difficult position in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under the fashion. Its reformives focus primarily on the bureaucratic irrishness, which in the multinational state all too long accelerated any entrepreneurial spirit. Firms now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a stronger insolvency and concurrence law creates conditions for more liquidating glossoteous companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In the first five fashion years, in India, economical optics have made a great deal better, but in trade policy, it is not the case. It is intended to protect internationally little competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the west, the fashion of the Nimbus of the Energy Reformer, which re-establishes its country economically radically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary western managers like. In the core, however, the Indian First Advocat never depended on a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to disappear anachronistic outcomes and thus be fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive their branches, thanks to the survival of their branches, are among the tribal choosers of Modis nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and complain about this short-term policy.
Establishment of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is to be accompanied by a report in Paris the next week. The former Head of State will be awarded on Monday at Montparnasse's Cemetery in the southern capital of France, the news agency AFP reported to the Chiracs family. The facility will take place in the close family. For Sunday, a public grief feast was held in Paris’ Invaliddom, as media reported.
The competitors have been brought to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light athlete WM
The world tip was long in the goal of the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. At the first stage of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swim dangerously. He could hardly keep himself on his legs, running in unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the western African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undermined him and supported him with the last half of the stadium round in the target. However, the forces were still enough to stop the armband clock after the target run. As if the scene had not already been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected to draw the attention of the gathered journalists. Shadows he would not have spoken about his heroism at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one passionate companion. And anyway he would be proud to represent his country that was invited to the World Confederation for the World War. Under normal circumstances he couldn't have started once. "I'm so proud to run here for my country," he said.
This is what he did in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he had thought of. For this hero's act will remain in memory. Especially Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the target and voluntarily took over the last place - still about five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this course. At the end, it had nothing to do with it, because the busby, which came only with much help in the target, was disqualified precisely at the end of the world's light athletical association.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and was studying there in Lisbon, was invited to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. According to official data, though at 18:10,87 minutes, he was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was already in 18 minutes." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million mashes: Egyptians rest for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the premises of potential government criticism. In the centre of Cairos, a stronger police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir spot were locked.
Already last days the police had strengthened their street controls and some of the phones of pedestrians searched for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They addressed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and maladministration. Such an open protest against political leadership had not existed in Egypt for years. The Spanish exile Egyptian constructor and actress Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for today a "million march" at central places in the country. Ali calls for a "volksrevolution". The man is also not "Gute, because he was a subcontractor to the arms, but his messages arrive.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase, according to two observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) were speaking of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed. The government confirmed and did not comment the figures.
Random arrests
Many people had been "willingly arrested", "only because they were 'in the wrong time in the wrong place'," HRW informed prisoners on appeal to lawyers. The charges against the arrested persons were sufficient, according to their lawyers, from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities consulted and searched security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, as well as willing passengers.
HRW also criticized the censur in the North African country. So the government blocks websites and online services in Cairo to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Shipping dealers should be able to make returns easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost goods. About 20 million returns land on the trash. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers like Amazon and Zalando a way of giving back-send products instead of destroying them.
Although it was not possible to free the companies from the turnover tax on contributions, the Ministry declared a question of the Green Friday fraction, which the newspapers of the radio media group reported on Friday, but traders could set the market value of the unsaled retours so low that they would have to pay no or only little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens were sending back every sixth package on the Internet when ordering. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - landed in the waste afterwards. It would cost the companies additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate financial donations such as a turnover on which then turnover tax.
Green-Fraction Manager Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify, with a decision, that companies can not evaluate and freely spend products to publicly useful organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donation. This was not only applicable to the online trade but also for other businesses from fashion shop to construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be enhanced.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the reconstruction of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the fundamental position characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's is to be issued in the British capital until it is intended to be enlarged on 3 October. It is estimated to be EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first issued in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Great Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had issued the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. At this occasion, the work that was formerly called "query hour" was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Devolved Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had recently delivered a tough exchange of opposition at the first meeting of the sub-house after a forced interruption by the Supreme Court by Johnson. Johnson wants to carry out the brexit already postponed twice on 31 October, if necessary without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, intervenes in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a messle. The work sees daily thousands of truck drivers and other visitors at the entry into the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "Spaziergang in the park"
The violent verbal attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament, in its opinion, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. In comparison with the election fight before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "Spaziergang in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book idea. "We will enjoy this. We will come out (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past days and sent them, among other things, "deceiving" to the people, and accusations that he could put the Members in danger because they could become about targets of murder threats, he dealt with as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest was if the members of the British finally respected the decision to withdraw from the EU, and it would not be surprising that the people were exposed to the fact that Britain had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called to restrain. "We should talk with each other with respect," it said in an explanation. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan demands uno intervention in Kaschmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir Conflict at his first appearance before the Uno-Voll Assembly.
Otherwise another war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kaschmir. Both nuclear powers control each part of Kashmir, another part of China. In early August India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus strikingly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrations in Cairo call for the fall of the Egyptian president al-Sisi.
The government reacts hardly against the present protests in Egypt. It has been able to shoot the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2000 arrested in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protests have never been dangerous in Egypt. But since the overtake of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State's device is doing everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests 2011 was the bad economic situation. poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being embedded by its own government drew millions to the road. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get under control, regardless of how hard it is to deal with opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third person lives under the poverty limit in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also for the largest economic player. The military builds roads, houses, football towns, produces food and many more. It was already before el-Sisi. With autoritary regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old. Critically it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulties to offer themselves a bottle of water at all.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No longer "Showstopper" for capital airport
Two months has been checked whether the complicated installation facility at the BER-Brand protection functions in the interplay. Operators are satisfied with the history. However, the Tüv is not yet finished at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said Supervisor Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport Manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful examination, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many detail topics, but we don't have a real show stop." He assured that the schedule until the start-up remains buffering.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction production indicator is now intended to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020 at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be corrected; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the intake of the flight operation, we need to continue to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are lacking evidence, less about new cables. There is no release for all the dubbles on which the cable cables hang. The airport manager expects it to be available until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactory yet. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cutting down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. Therefore, 36 engines need to be exchanged. Then there will be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree angels as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be started in 2011. The costs have risen from two billion to expected about 6.5 billion euros to be opened in the next year since the start of 2006.
Since the numbers of passengers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the responsible plans to expand the airport. Therefore, it is to be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the Chairman of the Bretschneders announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance manager Heike Fölster switches to the German railway at the end of the year, Manfred Bobke-von Camen goes to pension next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Drugs explosive machines - Police arrests you
He needed money for drugs - and chased several machines in the Chemnitzer city area in the air! Now the deceiver is finally in prison!
In the past two years, the number of cigars and parking ticket carmats in Chemnitz and the region has increased significantly. There has been a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German at the Civil Road and on the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations on the production of explosive explosions in fact unit with a particularly severe case of theft conducted by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspect against the 33-year-olds."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to eight acts.
The police speaker: "He seemed to have financed his defective dependency." Only four times the bomber had exploded parking ticket machines at the Civil Road between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automatic bomb is now investigating. Police investigations continue to run against him.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic explosions in Chemnitz and neighbouring circuits.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group crushed its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price fight with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed on Friday a press speaker of Austrian Airlines to the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Airhansa-Billigflyer Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. The current seven Eurowings flights remain four in Vienna. The AUA takes over from Jänner 2020 in "Wetlease", i.e. Eurowings-Personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Roads from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA cross and network planning, explained the speaker. The flight times are to be coordinated on connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the turning cross of Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, your Eurowings in Vienna are only used as a "Production Company" for the Group's Sister AUA. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight numbers, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product was intended to be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, pilots and flight companions came from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under AUA are not completed in Terminal 1, but as the AUA was completed at Terminal 3.
The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna was upgrading to 16 planes next summer on Thursday. The Irish cheap flyer sent four Ryanair machines as well as crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade unions as a constitution for the collective contract.
The Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary fighting that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, said on Friday, the AUA board Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years."
Queen-English Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now wedding the last of the four. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was expected to have stopped in Italy at the beginning of the month for the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are very pleased to be able to announce our engagement. We both are so happy to begin this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," the couple, which has been held by British media reports since October 2018, informed the official communication.
And further, "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures

A royal party
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information on date, location and everything else will be announced to the palace in the next few months.
However, it is certain that the confusion of the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul becomes a similar festival as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Studies on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart failure or an infarction? Hamburger researchers want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and ill people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to find out the causes of heart circulation diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) informed on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland the Hoge Mountain Hospital of Davos belonging to the Foundation and the University Hospital Zürich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essentially influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is not sufficiently known. Now scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with the 1000 former patients of the university heart and vessel center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were known from the clinicum. Each year, about 200 would be added.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as precaution, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in researching other people's diseases, so Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university heart and vessel center. New knowledge of the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer can be found.
The chairman of the Kohne-Stiftung, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is the strong will to use the data also for researching other diseases. The Clinic of the Foundation in Davos treats mainly allergies. Now, a center for Cardiovascular Accuracy Medicine on that site was to be created and a professor for bioinformatics. To reason his commitment, the Swiss logistic operator said that he was operated at the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who are also involved in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 volunteers, this is the world's largest local health study, according to the Clinic. In the heritage decryption, the scientists insured the protection of anonymised data. It is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zürich.
The inheritance of a human being can be decrypted today, according to UKE, within 24 hours. The pure cost of this is EUR 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is intended to begin on 1 October, and all the 9000 samples will be analysed at the end of 2020. The first results will be expected in the following year.
Nigerian police liberated hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police have exempted more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Coran School. "The victims were mistreated. Some of them claimed to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo, "the police spokesman Yakubu Sabo.
The boys had been held under the prejudice to be instructed in the Koran and "begotten". In fact, the protectors of their teachers were held under "the most devastating and inhuman conditions", Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
The Coran School has been informed of the situation in the Coran School for about ten years. Inhabitants had made the authorities aware of repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Coran School, Sabo said. They had no idea of the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested accordingly by the police.
In most Muslim Northern Nigeria there are many private Coran Schools. They replace the often lacking government institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to UN refugee aid, more than 40,000 people fled across the border in the neighbouring country of Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in the north of Nigeria have released almost 400 students from disgusting conditions. "Many of them were chained and some of them had visible injuries suggesting torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children had been discovered on Thursday after an indication in an islamically marked school, and the conditions had been "human insignificant". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the release action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school as slaves and were placed on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television pictures showed inferior and injured students in a detectable ill health condition.
World football selection: More accusations after Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "not valid signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa draws out the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never voted at the World Football Choice, complaints to the Fifa come from other countries. Egypt was not evaluated - with a curious reason.
Many things in the Fifa have proved to be devastated in recent years: the WM constitutions, dubiose plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. However, the Fifa World Footballer choice has not been suspected of uncleanness until now - if one fails to see that the empowered national trainers and national team captains of the Members' associations often agree to sympathy rather than after an objective assessment.
However, after the captain of Nicaragua had complained that he had not voted at all, there are other unfairs: Egypt complains that the votes of National trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures were made on the electoral forms in uppercase and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association had been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan’s trainer also amazed
While the situation in the case of Egypt is acknowledged, the Sudanese Association indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not voted as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was likewise taken with the signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
He also claimed Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "Do not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All details about my voice are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association just voted in his name.
From the Association came the report on Friday: It was true, but of course no intention. The filled electoral documents were "incorrectly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said it in a communication of the Association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas was elected. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," it said in the message. Rosas as well as the team trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "while as it stands in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases allow the Fifa to be examined in an investigation now, but stress that the election process was externally supervised by the PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains uncontroversial winners of the World Football Val and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian affairs: Ranghohe Republicans are responsible for official investigation
Two ranked Republicans have been open to an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the United States Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this results from here, it is determined by the facts that are detected." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures are taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the discoveries, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly invited the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate the activities of the democratic president and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "for years".
So far, the Republicans have refrained from criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only few have detected unpleasantness. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's Party, and the moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as the deterioration of environmental protection and the reinforcement of immigration rules.
As further ranked Republicans, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right way and responsibility for the convention is now to examine the matter and to go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as the governor of the US states, have formally failed to communicate in the process against Trump, which will be decided at the convention. Their statements are therefore mainly symbolically important. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also been critical about the situation. In the middle of Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". The US media also report that under the Republican's internal first races were taking place.
The affair could be used in the initiation of an official consultation procedure against Trump, and the democratics in the House of Representatives have announced an inquiry to this, and they are prejudging him for power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefits.
There is no exact timetable for the procedure for the adoption of the Office. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the democratics could struggle with a so-called impeachment. The decision on a actual official survey, but in the Senate where Trumps Republicans have the majority, the prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. Until now, no US President has been dismissed by a Implementation procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, supposed to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had managed the port of Lampedusa with the Savior Ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Liberian refugees on board unlawfully. After strong protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was resolved after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now new serious accusations against rackets will be loud. Three men who have been tortured in Libyan refugee camps with the "Sea-Watch 3" arrived in Italy. The suspects have been arrested in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their penalties in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but have no even secured information," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Newbuilder of the German Press Agency.
In mid-September, the police stated that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematicly shaken and exposed to greeds - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the Communication.
NGOs and auxiliary organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said new builders. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya. It would therefore be very likely that they are also acting on the ships. "It is therefore very important that it should be checked."
Italy's former Prime Minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized for rackete, which is still established in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car corporation with the prospect of new record numbers strong updrive at the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks round letters. The challenge was to bring the cars quickly to the customer. To do so, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible for the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered up to 95.000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers will have to be achieved in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are small profit margins. Despite the tree's last losses.
US-Budget-Steuer: Renew only a bridge funding
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and decided a transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the U.S. Convention and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will stand before the new fishing year starting on 1 October once more without spending plans. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a part-closure of the Federal Administration. President Trump must still put the decision in force.
Disabled shutdown
The Federal Administration will now be financed provisionally at the level and in line with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the monthly financial year at the end of the month 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the expenditure framework of 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio. $.
The democratics have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of democratics who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans.
The spirits distinguish themselves mainly in the area of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. The democratics are disturbing the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The fight about the wall construction was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
On the wall, the spirits divorce
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to draw closer to this issue. More likely than an agreement on all the twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November. Also a shutdown is not excluded once again.
In the light of the persistent inability of the Congress to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and thus the risk of shutdown gains ideas to automate the process of popularity. Suggestions p. 1877 to prevent shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the Federal Administration at the previous level, interfere with the travel activities of parliaments, and keep their wages down until the new annual expenditure plans are made.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, the artificial fertility will also be open for women and lesbians who live alone: the Paris National Assembly voted with a great majority for a government lawsuit, which enables all women to use in vitro fertility, which is expected to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The proposal still requires the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up. The French Bishop conference is also against renewal.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethic law, which was defended by Health Minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be carried by social insurance.
Conservation with sperm from dead husband continues to be prohibited
With a few majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which should give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, the artificial fertilization of "post-mortem" was allowed. In Germany there were in the past cases in which women blamelessly complained about the release of the sperm of a dead man. The opponents of the precursor in Paris argued that a so-born child then suffered a "a specially severe fate".
Many members of the Government Party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and members of the Opposition, on the other hand, had spoken for the artificial fertility with the sperm of the dead partner. They stressed that a widow would be imposed a "double grief" if her husband's death remained unfulfilled with her child wish.
The initiators of the now failed amendment believe it is unfair that a widow can be frustrated with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner in future.
Until now, the artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual pairs that can't prove to be children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the breastfeeding continues to remain forbidden.
In Germany, the artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is still often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for climate: Call after air charge for unis are higher
There is a lot of flooding at the universities, so the country will also be able to carry out a climate tax in the future. The directors say they have no money for it. But now they also get under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschule
The discussion of a climate tax on flights from universities and universities before the summer break comes back in waving. After the national rector conference had skeptically reacted to a corresponding incidence from the green-black coalition, the plans are now given support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral members of six bath-worttembergic universities and a pedagogical university for compensation of service flights. This is the first step "necessary", at the same time a wide debate on the avoidability of flights must be held in their opinion. The cabinet decision that was initially planned in July is therefore further on ice because the CDU has not yet approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia renames North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB Secret Service, the prisoners were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a change of shots between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later killed his serious injuries, but this time there were no injuries, said it.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food deficiency. Thus, the North Korean fishermen were traveling in Russian territorial waters, where Russia’s coastal guard travels according to its own information on the protection of its marine biological resources.
30,000 ink fish consumed
During the new controls, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and captured on the boats. In addition, three fishermen and two motorboats were captured and brought to Nachodka and Poshet at Vladivostok.
Russian fisheries consultants had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in this year.
The Chief of the Association of Russian Fisheries Company in the remote eastern region Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fed with close synthetic networks banned in Russia. With these would also get small creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they need 200 years to be destroyed.
Only 18,000 in the future: United States reduces asylum upper limit
The largest nation in history: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with chosen police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is protective: As confirmed by the Washington Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the upper limit for the legal accession of refugees is further lowered. In the future, the threatened believers and Iraqer asylum are to be received.
The U.S. Government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the introduction of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people will be left in the country, as the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared. In the nearly expired marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the acceptance of protective seekers from all over the world over the past years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher limits had been paid.
The ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred to the USA as the most compassionate and generous nation in history, a formula which strongly reminds us of the language usage of the official US president.
A "responsible association" with refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A huge point of dispute is the border to Mexico, which will lock up Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had ceased the national emergency. Whether there is a timely connection between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the US capital, it is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening procedure to take office.
The U.S. Government will, as presented by the Foreign Office, focus on the adoption of two refugee groups in future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the US military in the country and thus have been in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reveals. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be included.
The U.S. wants people from this "nordern triangle" of Central America to request asylum in other countries. In this context, the United States have concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to reduce migration at the US Southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release from Orang-Utan from zoo
An orange outan female has been moved to a capture station for human monkeys in the United States on request of the Argentine jurisdiction from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra", born in the Rostocker Zoo in 1986, was addressed to the rights of a "non-human person", so it was compulsory. The animal was brought to Dallas on the Thursday evening by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez declared.
Since the 53 kilos heavy man's appetite is not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it is intended to live in the future in the lounge of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are 21 more orange outans and 31 chimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to endure a approximately 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US Federal State of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras", which was endeavored by animal protectors in 2014, has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an Ökopark. By 2023, a research and educational site for the conservation of species diversity is to be created there.
Record for Swiss Extremberg Climbing: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extremberg Climb Dani Arnold has enjoyed a new Husarenritt in the Italian Alps at the nearly 3,000 meters high cinnamon.
Without a network, double floor or other equipment, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinn in a new record time.
Cleided with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus he undermined the old best mark for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now recorder at Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The U.S. portfolio manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profit gap, regardless of the trade conflict with China. The net profit increased to $1.4 billion in the last quarter (cover €1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the group informed on Tuesday. This is mainly why the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct" with which the Adidas competitor directly contacts its customers online.
The sales increased to $10.7 billion in the three months of August. The Nike sales figures increased by a plus of 22 percent in China. In this way the Group from Beaverton in the U.S. State of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic of the People's Republic from its approach to direct direct addressing consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports article manufacturer, thus expanding its competitive advantage. The investors reacted happyly to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports article manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Due to racist comments on football professional Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban against a fan. The defendant Jesus from Brazil had been embarrassed by the fan on Instagram. Then Jesus published the private news and called on his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToracism. Proud of being who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who plays with AS Rome since 2016.
The association reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters may never again visit a game of the association, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racialism is a problem in the Italian football. Regularly scanning Italian fans racist vaccinations against black players of rivalising teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You must identify and throw the responsible ones out of the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. At the first party of Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence were racist singing on the last Sunday.
But also about the adherents of Juventus Turin, there had been last discussions. The Italian authorities have now proved 38 arbitrary fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are expected to stop joining the stadium for a decade of ten years, the police informed. For the rest of them, bans are therefore applicable from four to seven years.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fan-Gruppes in the context of Juventus. The twelve are being charged with heavy extortion, money laundry and private violence. The club had rolled the investigations with an ad last year.
According to Italian media reports, the Ultra leaders should have placed behind the black trade with tickets. They had the ticket trade for the fan basket "military control" and should have pressed Juventus employees to get more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcisstic, the generation Z is political - all the years are taken with proper names. See more accurately, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective feeling of life of young people?
"The Krabbles come!" On September 21th, this call officially launched the crawl catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, with which the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was announced, as was announced by the Department of Public Work of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in environmental terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun have already started crab growing. Over the past years, the crab industry has developed into a profound sector that ensures high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively worked for a large, ecological and scientific development of crab growing as well as a technological-based crab growing.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform on the "distribution of power, optimization of administration and authorities" and carefully set up the Service Network for "Authorisations under a roof, a team for criminal persecution, a network for services, a platform for credit awards" and thus aims to optimise the environment for authorizations, services and development.
Gaochun creates the advantages given on-site by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and fully utilizes the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as dependent signs, to resettle intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector, as well as farms for environmental agriculture leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and foreign transport of national importance. In addition, the environmental and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun, the state of civil services and public service have been fully improved.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the United Nations Full Assembly, spoke of a claimed offer of the United States to repeal sanctions. The United States would have put an end to all sanctions in view for discussions with the Teheran leadership, explained Ruhani on its official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian colleague about Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to cancel the sanctions that were imposed against him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the occurrence as follows: The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have drew for a meeting. "And America says I raise the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of penalty that should be completed has been the debate. "And they have clearly said that we raise all sanctions."
However, Ruhani criticized this incidence not in an acceptable manner. In view of the current penalties and the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure, no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
In the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel had met Ruhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is supposed to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani would meet with U.S. president Donald Trump, as Markel at the border of the United Nations Full Assembly.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 revers
After western Turkey was shocked by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the previous day there have been nearly 200 afterquakes, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This increases concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropol. Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in future, octay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the late danger is always ignored. Every year, badly built houses fall into - among other things made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
For years, town plans like the famous architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas registered in the centre as refugees have been long built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Bay in August, Istanbul's construction engineer chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake safe.
The epicenter of the earthquake from Thursday was located in the Marmara Lake in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers deep, as announced by the Avad Disaster Protection Authority. A small afterquake caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
The Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu informed on Twitter that injured or damage had not been reported at first. The State Sender TRT showed people who ran panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for safety reasons. Some students wept as they saw on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly jeopardized by earthquakes. Under the Marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Plate. Turkey is always shocked by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the earthquake in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that a earthquake could threaten the strength of 7,1 to 7,4. But when it comes to earthquake, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday came back to the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags packed with all the necessary ready next to doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wakes. When the next big earthquake comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly damage. The Istanbulian mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbuler Disaster Coordination Centre (Acom). According to its information, two minarettes of Moscheen crashed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning from afterquakes in Istanbul
In social networks, many users report of panic. buildings wailed. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It had been harder than that from Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter from decaying. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the earthquake is reported by 13.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was an afterquake reported with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
First on Tuesday, a earthquake of strength 4.6 shook the Turkish marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also, its epicenter was located in the Marmara lake west of the million metropol, the Afad disaster protection authority informed us on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a heavy earthquake.
Researchers assume that it could come to a disastrous earthquake in Istanbul earlier or later - the tension between the techtonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually be discharged - and massive damage.
Earthquake researchers Sükkrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It had become more likely, he said to CNN Turkk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "Four or later the great earthquake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the earthquake also caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured people. Also, this year, at the sea of the ground had the earth incurred.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two brisante documents provide new lighting in the Ukrainian affair for the possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official investigation procedure, the U.S. Democrats are strengthened: the complaint submitted by an anonymous reference provider on Trump and its controversial phoneship with the Ukrainian President offers important points for investigations against the President. Trump itself looks more than the victim of a "hex hunt". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - Flyer redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilette, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The WC door had been blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight in 1554, the Airline informed the US media.
In the event of an extraordinary interconnection on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be freed from the close cabin. About an hour if she had been locked in it, U.S. media wrote to other passengers, calling on them. For a further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, according to US media from Flight 1554, several people are trying to liberate the woman. "We are working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized to all passengers. First, it was open if the woman gets a refund.
The cake lake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about - and his protagonist is unrecognized.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous story "The Conversion" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in UK.
The Roman "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear on November 27 in German, the Diogenees publisher (Zürich) informed. In this it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now at once the mightyst man of Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to carry out the will of the people and is willingly determined to stop from anything and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers in high positions seek the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." By McEwan was only published in the spring of the Roman "Maschines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas in 1915 first published story is Gregor Samsa, who awakens one morning and looks "to an unhappy uncleaner" and is gradually excluded from family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan descends in front of Kafka to describe a world, the head stands," said the Diogenes publisher.
The EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian rail infrastructure
1,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary receive flush brakes to reduce noise load by freight trains. Also, sections of railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna New Town and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
This is intended, according to the information of EU-wide travels, to make it more comfortable and to reduce CO2 emissions.The funds come from the EU infrastructure cover "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until 31 October
A day after his insolvency request, the German travel organiser Thomas Cook cancelled all the trips until 31 October 2019. Travelling could not be "for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
These are also affected by bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen und Air Marin, who have already been paid or paid completely. As it is about travel starting from November 1, 2019, the company left open. In conjunction with insolvency insurance, the further procedure is examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been in the sock of the British Mother Group and had sent on Wednesday insolvency request. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, employs some 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels immediately again money
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels in abroad, which are still in the home of Thomas-Cook holidays, are to receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that holidays are no longer invited to pay extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without submission of separate bills, the hotels in the holiday places are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook travelers from these hotels are not immediately asked or required for individual payment of hotel bills," said speaker Bernd Engelien.
Insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their homes on their own, and some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider voted on Friday, the insurance speaker said. According to Thursday information, there were 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschal holidays traveling from Germany. The Zurich Germany has secured the vacation and return of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and to find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through Zurich Insurance help only the travellers who are still on the road. For Thomas Cook customers who want to fly only on vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening the company told that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands for travels with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In conjunction with insolvency insurance, the further approach is examined, it said. In principle, the insurance of Zurich is also responsible for these cases. Sales of new travels have stopped. dpa
The company refers to the Insurer Zürich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of reimbursement of the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys the bomb in Angola
Prince Harry has long continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he now walks directly on the traces of his mother.
With a blue splinter protection west, the British prince Harry in Angola has burned and destroyed a bomb mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place Dirico, he made the fire circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the Savannah landscape, without damage. Although only the Halo Trust has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decade of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mining fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same bomber who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she was going at that time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a clear mining field in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife, Meghan (38), have been on a ten-day trip to Africa, which has started in the South African Tourist Metropole Cape Town since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The danger of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated: with him there will be no guarantee of a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations, but what statements have been made at the polarizing British forever. The recent judgment of the High Court of First Instance in Great Britain has been suspended as a Damokles-swaard over the Blondskopf. Its suspension of the Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the date of the expiry, was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliged Johnson to achieve a extension of bilateral discussions with the EU until 31 October. However, this had always been excluded by category.
Boris Johnson thinks the deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass Johnson. In the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he suggested that he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October in the case of non-communication:
You know, we're gonna comply with the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm carefully optimistic that this will work.
And the time runs the Brexit traders in Brussels gradually, and the EU and the British traders have time to prevent the entry out of the United Kingdom without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not yet achieved any breakthrough. A agreement by the end of October appears more difficult at present. If the British Prime Minister does not imagine the law, a new shift of the date of departure is in force. The opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could apply any way in the case of a no-deal the Brexit.
US-Consultants: Other deaths caused by E-Cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of E cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in "New England Journal of Medicine" there has already been more than 900 subjects, confirmed about 500 of them. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe no similar increase in lung damage has been known. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The constructors and actors living in Spain call for a "volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he called on further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military whose critics are proposing corruption and maladministration. Ali hopes that there will be a lot of research with one million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairos, there has already been an increased police presence. Several U-Bahn stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir spot were locked. Already in the past days the police had strengthened their street controls and some of the phones of footers searched for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrations also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, there had been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. Similarly, the security forces responded hard. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) human rights organization, almost 2,000 people were arrested last week. Many of them had been randomly arrested - just because they were "in the wrong time on the wrong place" and HRW informed lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censur in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to interfere with further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he had crashed the democraticly chosen Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, Bloggers and Activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg Harbour, among other things, by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought the climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the race hunt "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of earth heating in the past months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Islands and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to report to word. It has been known for decades that the earth is warm. Yet many have acted like a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often happening under the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of heating and mulination of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured with a drone of Greenland glacier and fished with networks for microplastics, said it.
For his "fighting for a sustainable and respectful use of the seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the Hamborg climate week. "For us all who are in the heart of survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great model," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the price leasing. "He is a witness of the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades."
Cheap Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nudles 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 Euro drink money was included by the two women, but they posted the quitting on Facebook, which caused warm reactions.
"Some cases harm the view of Rome. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker of Federagit, the association of the travel leaders in Rome, according to the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero.
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese women had not only ordered Spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not taken from the bill. Also a drink money of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an official consultation procedure after the turbulent discoveries of the past days, the democratics want to examine this with their investigation in the representative house now as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would fall.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephone with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposedly standing at the public: the President abused the power of his office to make the government of another country instrumental to influence the election of 2020. It has exploited the Ukrainian dependency in this way and is thus trying to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be implemented in the currently published letter of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not render the full text. The phone office of 25 July is only a episode of a much larger story, in which the center is next to Trump, mainly its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the public in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giulianis travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet himself in Kiev with the newly chosen President Selenskyj, and the lawyer knows very precisely that his intentions are tough. "We do not intervene in a choice, we intervene in an investigation of what we have the right to," he says the newspaper. It can be believed that it is unpleasant, but "there is nothing illegal". Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine investigations for which there is hardly a basis - "because these information will be very, very helpful for my clients and can be shown as helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have infected with right conspiracy fantasy, fixed on Trumps' counter-candidatin at the election in 2016: Hillary Clinton had conspired with stakeholders in the Ukraine, critics at that time said to construct an occasion for Russian investigations in the United States.
This is about the explanations that the Trump will speak so prominently on the phone in July with Selenskyj. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice-President and currently prospective candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have pressed as Ukrainian representative of the Obama Government on the release of the former Ukrainian General State Attorney Wiktor Schokin. In order to stop the examination of the gas company responsible in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was active, the Ukrainian has depressed the Ukrainian financially to protect the corrupted powers of his family.
In fact, the expiry was something different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected of it. In addition, chokin himself was defeated very corrupt gestures, the US Government was far from the only Western partner who pushed to his release. In addition, the Obama Government even expressly supported the investigations against the company.
Disturbances with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, mostly Germany, UK and Spain are affected. On the website all disturbances.de users report that Facebook has not been loading again since about 15.30 p.m. The error message also reveals that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems affected by the disturbance, although not in the same range.
Instagram and co. more often affected by disturbances
It is not the first massive disturbance this year. Already in March and in July, the services had fallen out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also take back this time mainly on Twitter to air their trouble.
Saved Polish scientists in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They had travelled with a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue hub screw for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"On 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the sleeping boat."
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station since 1977, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were probably brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NOT wirelessly charged
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used anyway.
Since the last time several new smartphones have come to the market, supporting cableless charges and selling themselves very well - all ahead of the new iPhone 11 models, we want to call again a study from early July into memory. Though cableless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not strictly recommended.
Higher temperature adds battery
Researchers are warning against the cableless loading of smartphones. This is, according to the knowledge of the university of Warwick, extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heating development. If a mobile phone is offered normally by cable, the battery rises within three hours to 27 degrees. In the wireless charge, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is a little besides the waste, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the power strength of the charging pad, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height, increases.
Capacity and lifetime
According to researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of batteries is a crucial factor. Each degree plays a role. When loading at higher temperatures, the battery does not only take into account capacity but does not last as long as long. Thus, the lifespan of the battery is less. Therefore, researchers advise to always charge the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange at modern smartphones is constantly connected with high costs, this is probably a helpful tip. Apple has ultimately increased the cost of a battery exchange even again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is very convenient:Please put the device on a suitable charging pad - they are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a disturbing cable salad and tired steaker fume. Since with Qi (for induction energy transfers) a global standard, with exceptionally even Apple, there is hardly restrictions. However, the technology should be applied only in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climbing has, according to its own details, reached 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, informed his expedition organiser.
The former soldier wants to climb all the 14 eight thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headers: it comes from a viral photo of mountain climbs on Mount Everest Snake in the spring.
The image of the mass aspiration launched a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbs had died in the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the climbing of the 14th eight thousand: currently Chinese authorities lock the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of a week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to speak to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a violent elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants have been poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protective area close to the famous and visited by many tourists previous rock mounting Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old by the police speaker. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year. The deceivers are often farmers whose land had previously been harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This is usually happening when the animals move through nearly built villages of their habitat.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants live. Theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.
Containing British oil tanks leave Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its festival through Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas maritime agency, according to the Irna news agency. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanks driving under the British flag on 19 July under the prejudice to disregard the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Committee of the Underhouse intends to examine the complaint of the traveler Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner, as well as the question of why the British government would not allow financially to join the company fighting for survival. "Our interest applies to the company as well as the control by external accounting officers," informed the Committee Chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to do so with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestine cancer
The role of genes in the familiar increased risk of intestinal cancer has been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are likely to weigh more than ever. This has consequences for calculations of the individual risk of darm cancer, the DKFZ knowers stress.
Elon Musk makes Tesla share rise
This was written by Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, which continues in Musks round letters.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the advertising rapidly, and Tesla must offer as many resources as possible for the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers will have to be achieved in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are small profit margins. Despite the tree's last losses.
Will the British Government handle Brexit law? Johnson retarding
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, considers whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit law if possible, and on a question he said on Friday, before journalists, that his government would adhere to applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a change in the date of departure, no agreement should have been reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political shakes" in order to avoid the law. Johnson could use a procedural strike that moved the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he seeks a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to have an agreement."
Iran seems to drive up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the fight against the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European States show incapacity or lack of willingness when it comes to specific actions," Rohani said on Thursday at a press conference at the front of the United Nations Plenary Assembly in New York. In the case they do not comply with their promises, he placed "more steps" away from the 2015 toughly negotiated agreements.
The background is the conflict with the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a result of the commitment to Teheran, was to normalize economic relations. The United States rose in 2018 in the entrance of the agreement to force Iran with "maximimum pressure" to change the course of the post-host policy considered aggressive. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder obligations and now re-enforce hard penalties against Teheran. Iran last reacted with a resuming of the limited uranium enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses or at least prepared for use in uranium the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
The Europeans may not be willing to carry their part of the deal, so the Iranians, with the costs and burdens of pressing US sanctions alone, have left the Muted Rohani, but there will be further discussions that hopefully have a solution.
Rohani continues Iran’s development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Great Britain followed on Monday the US assumption that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebells supported by Iran had known to the attack in Yemen, but what was considered by the USA as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must present evidence for it," said Rohani, but the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General debate would not have known that they would only have called on the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had hit themselves in recent days with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible discussions with U.S. President Trump, the widespread sanctions of the US administration had to be repealed, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to turn to a policy of dialogue and reason.
Comet of other star crossed sunsystem
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This did only once before. The comet allows conclusions to other solar systems.
What was initially just a suspect, is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of the space was baptized after its discoverer to 2I/Borisov and has awakened the interest of astronomers worldwide.
The largest comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo-Observatorium in the Krim - with a self-builded telescope of 65 cm diameter. Follow-ups of various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 only the second interstellar object that has been seen during a passing through our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insight into a foreign solar system from the vicinity before it disappears at nommers. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which in this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," reports Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Authority of Nasa in a communication.
The comet is the analysis of a so-called hyperbel path that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomic Union (IAU) notified. It is also responsible for the name and classification of heavenly bodies. To honor his discoverer, the interstellar sweavers, first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the name 2I/Borisov, and the first part of the name pointed out that it was the second interstellar object that was discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in flight. Thus, researchers will remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "After that it will only be seen by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor to the visitor. Thus a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set in a first investigation the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 km. Recordings of the Gemini-Observatorium in Hawaii show a clear sweep of the comet.
Researchers and researchers from the Canary Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellary swivel star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of our solar system comets, and this points to what must be similar to their composition," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves by similar processes as in our, supplemented de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such steps are, it is hard to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors may take off a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency wants to station the three-party space zone "Comet Interceptor" (German competen-fighter) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the earth. According to Esa, Director of Science, Günther Hasinger, it is intended to lie either on an unaffected, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega airport Daxing
In time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so far: On the new Mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and in 2025 it will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestige project is also called "Southers" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four start- and landing trains that will be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new subway transports passengers to the centre of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been largely smaller since 2006, has been relocated. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine has landed after four years.
New overhead aircraft is intended to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - the British Space Agency is dreaming of UK Space Agency. It is possible to make this flight, which was in the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the Agency. "This is the technology that could definitely produce it," said Office Manager Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We are talking about the 2030s for the startup, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work closely with the Australian capital. A flight from the British capital to the Australian Metropole is currently about 20 hours. As the only overcast airplane for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the line New York-Paris from 1976 to its setting in 2003 and used three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 insets were killed. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin Planes announced that it was known to develop an overall aircraft, together with the US Space Authority of Nassau, the "X-Plane". Also Virgin Galactic had such developments in the programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travels with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Also, such planes can be used outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "near generation of truly reuseable railing devices".
Revolution in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous tips providers in Ukraine-Affäre
In the Ukraine affair of potential misuse of power by the US President, Donald Trump wants to detect possible undesirable places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday before the U.S. Messengers with the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and had been "a little different" in the past than today.
This was evaluated as an intimidation attempt against tip donors. The event was in fact not public. However, several US media distributed audio media from the talk on Friday. Democracies reacted to the President's statement.
The democratics in the US Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official consultation procedure against Trump. Their allegations were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee, who raised serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On large public pressure, the signs of the advisor were published on Thursday.
In the context of his work, Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees that the U.S. President "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country intervenes in the choosing of the US 2020.
In the centre of the charges, a controversial telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his official colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rivals Joe Biden. It is about previous transactions by Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and claimed efforts to protect his spouse from the Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower accused the White House, with a view to the Ukrainian telephone, also of the best practice: Leaders of government would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual an electronic wording protocol was made, but this had been published after the conversation on the instruction of lawyers from the White House from a generally intended database and instead was stored in a specially protected system.
The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an agency of the CIA abroad secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" has distributed information from a second hand that would have appeared as inappropriate. Therefore there may be no hints or spies.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have acted to the Whistleblower's information, however, provoked annoyment. The president of the US Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted and complained, Trump's statement once again undermines the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various committees have been conducting various investigations against Trump and its environment for months. In view of the Ukrainian claims, the democratics are now ongoing investigations with new waists in order to initiate a possible process of official collection against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the Representative House, Adam Ship. Trump attacked ship sharply, cast him a wrong presentation of things and again demanded the withdrawal of the chairman of the Committee. Trump regularly slandered ship and had already requested its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and external policy area, which were mostly involved in democratic, but also in the Republican presidents, stood in a statement published on Friday behind the investigation initiated by the democratics for a possible procedure of official consultation. If the arguments were true, it would be a "scrollless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
For the further process there is no exact timetable. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the democratics could endeavour a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual official survey, however, was in the Senate where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. No US President has yet been taken away by an impediment procedure of the Office.
VW operating council: jobs are "sleeving"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce the cost of production could go to the burden of production in Germany and Europe, which is a matter of concern to the carbuilder's operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, and of which 500 million euros will be saved this year.
A key to this is the cost of staff. The future covenant, negotiated in 2016 between companies and business councils, will already provide for the decline of 14,000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be declined by the carbuilder if it is proven that the activities associated with it are no longer necessary.
However, as our newspaper learned from operating council circles, jobs in production that are not actually at disposition will be "slicking" over another way - that is, at the official course, and thus freely growing regular jobs will often not be re-established.
In these cases, the Corporate Board has no possibility to force the re-occupation. At the moment, there is a lack of staff at many places, which increases the labour security, the concerns about gradual bleeding of the vehicles would be greater. In order to increase the fear that the vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. The VW said only: "A adjustment of employment volume is made as agreed socially sustainable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to improve the standardisation of production worldwide and to control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions – the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Just in unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China we are well advised to make us crises."
In this way there are already successes: For example, in this year, the production costs per vehicle would fall for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on production duration does not call VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is around 7 at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are manufactured. The works of Braunschweig and salt grids are made components. For Wolfsburg-Internal, VW-Internal the VW rules apply that there must be built 800,000 cars annually in order to make the work satisfactory profitable. In 2018, however, the exhaust load in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling Diesel-Nachfrage and the problems in the conversion to the new WLTP consumption and emission test procedure.
However, as the production board of Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are "perspective" to roll from the band. This is intended to enable the banding of the golf production in the tribal work - because the work Zwickau by restructuring to the location of the e-auto-production is leaving the golf featuring.
In Wolfsburg, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also produced. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have last declined. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. He is supposed to remain, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility, first of all, the Wolfsburger's bread-and-butter car.
Forcing Voodoo to prostitution: Human merchants condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with swears, slaughtered into the rural area and forced to prostitution. Six suspected human merchants must be imprisoned for this.
Six suspected human merchants from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday for exemption and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The accused women from Nigeria had moved into the rural area and forced to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the excursion-willing Nigerian women had to put a ritual swear before a voodoo prince.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought through the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan lockers, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed on various boardelles to work out the claimed locking costs of an average of 25 000 euros. The wage was therefore completely reduced.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on boardelle in the process. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the judgment pronunciation. "Some were correctly opposed."
The judgments are based on trade and bond-made inclusions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, restraints and heavy force prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIM's permanent struggle with the Airhansa Group has threatened Ufo with strikes again.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade unions will notify "on 14 October on the work-fighting measures in the LH Group", Ufo Tarif Board Daniel Flor informed on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have rejected the fact that they have been taking up tariff negotiations with Ufo, and it is also a matter of whether the trade unions have legally announced tariff contracts in the Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Working Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the tariff contracts were not dismissed. The Court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined it to make a case. "I believe that a second court considers the matter completely different," said the UFO Board.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the National Working Court of Frankfurt in order to make the status of the UFO as a trade unions judicially checked. The company argued that the trade unions have not established a representative board for months and thus could not fill its role as a tariff partner.
In advance, a violent leadership issue in the Sparten-Gewerkschaft, in which many members of the Board and the Advisory Board have retired, including the long-term council head of Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had suspended a already-started preliminary vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July, due to its doubts.
Eased entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia was not just known as an international tourist magnitude, but this is supposed to change. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa provisions.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in future. By 2030, the number of international and domestic visitors will be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatibi.
Saudi Arabia is hardly accessible to tourists so far. Visums are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with members of the desert country surgery. With the new rules, the Erzconservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. Riad wants to reduce its dependency on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had met two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik and the oil field Churais. In the follower, the national oil production drastically broke in, the oil price shots to the height. It should take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom recovered its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for a wedding party
Songer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in their Instagram Stories several festival photos on which she was seen in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized the People's Magazine, according to a boyfriend's divorce in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful, among other things printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his attendants: "Help me to choose my smoking for the wedding." According to media reports, the promi-Paar wants to marry church on the next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the yes word in a New York Stage Office a year ago. A larger festival had not existed at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't lead a relationship."
Two dead at aeroplane crash in Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small aircraft in the West of Czech Republic. The Wrack was discovered on Friday in a forest area at the city of Mecin (Methichine), the police informed. In the dead it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Since Thursday evening, the authorities had been looking for the machine after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In searching was also a military helicopter in use. The cause of accident has to be detected. The crash is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to pestilences, diseases, strangers, non-sustainable wooden stroke and the growth of cities are causes of threat, the World Nature Protection Union IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all known 454 trees in Europe. 265 of these are no other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 hours already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: of "potentially endangered" about "threatested", "threatested by extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct". Totally, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than threatened.
Eberse and Wild Roscasstania threatened
In Germany, Eberschen (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "The majority are threatened because the population is small anyway or by transforming or weakening their habitats."
It looks too bad for the wild roscastanians. They have been considered "threatested" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scales. The largest threat is to place the Balkan miner motts in addition to a sulphur. It has spread from south-eastern Europe since the 1980s and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild roscastanians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. The trees in cities, parks and alone are not taken into account in this assessment.
Snake and moose are also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for soft animals, mooses and mooses. More than a fifth of the soft animals and mooses and almost half of all types of fragrance were threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly related to the destruction of the wilderness, to the slaughtered species, to agricultural practices and to the climate change. Weight animals like snows played a key role in recyceling nutrients in the soil and being an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the rear of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of people on our ecosystems and make protection of these species priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 injured persons reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. The dead have not been reported. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for safety reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.

Now the government wants to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in future, octay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly jeopardized. Under the Marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disorder, which marks the border between the Euratic and Anatolic Earth Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the strongness 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The Epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast Istanbul. Over 17,000 people died.

Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira take place in the semi-time show
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football Final Super Bowl. It was known to the singers at Twitter. "Great it will not," Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She was insanely excited to stand on the Super-Bowl buildings. On February 2, 2020 it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she has dreamed of coming up at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She can hardly expect "to show what we girls can do on the largest stage in the world."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she feels honored to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it is the first time that the two "kings" are on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against decline in the numbers of viewers
The Super Bowl is the climax of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most viewed TV transmissions of the USA. Even if you're last dropped, this February the spectacle in the United States attracted the fewest viewers for more than ten years. However, there were still nearly a hundred million people in cut.
At the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, it had been upset: in the struggle about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, in February last media reports, Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group of Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the critics were little friendly.
Kapernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was in the game time 2016/17 before NFL games at the national hymne of protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Cape Pennick resolved a movement, numerous players took the gesture. This caused great excitement, US president Donald Trump attacked mostly the African football stars. Capebernick itself has been unenigheted since March 2017 and has no longer entrusted NFL party. He advocates the associations to not want to hire him for political reasons.
Cook care: Hotels receive money from insurance
Some banks are supposed to be expensive for the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. It threatens high depreciation of outstanding loans and loans. It also affected the credit Suisse, writes the Financial Times in their release of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse would probably have to make total depreciations on their books of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report. This would have shown estimates by AlixPartner's consultant.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The actual depreciation amounts would be more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, said an expert to the paper.
The losses of the creditors at the end will show itself after the expiry of the insolvency procedure. A person near this procedure did not squeeze too much hope. For example, the about 40 planes of Thomas Cook in UK are "old" and many of the real estates are in bad layers. Most of the money you could probably get out with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete is supposed to have brought suspected murderers to Italy.
The Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this but have no even secured information on it," said the speaker of the Sea-Watch Refugee Organisation, Ruben Neubauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are assaulted to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The suspected actors were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
On June 29th, Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa, entering a ship of the Italian financial police. On that day the three suspects were supposed to have arrived there.
United States warns federal government from Huawei
The head of the US Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," said Pai to the "trading sheet" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which obliges each company "under Chinese law" to follow the instructions of the security bodies.
The existing law also prohibits the company to inform third parties about such requests," the FCC CEO continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidence declaration" from suppliers.
At first, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the "trading sheet" reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
The software is very important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that changes in time," said Pai.
It's "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "whenever, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC-Chef continues.
The Chinese group Huawei has a close contact with the Chinese state device:
The property relationships are opaque. The employee company that claims to belong to the company is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai the "trading sheet".
The United States finds out that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for discussions in Berlin to advertise for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in Northern France burns: Schools closed
In the night, inhabitants hear explosions. A gigantic firewall illuminates the sky over a North-French chemistry factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemistry factory in the North-French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cramps remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be carefully opened on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of Interior had invited the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not suspend themselves to smoking. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to set up the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the eradication of smell spread, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police and gentlemen were in use at the fireplace.
A huge black smoke column had previously risen from the chemistry factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the company Lubrizol, which produces an additive for oils. The production system is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are specially monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, a devastating chemistry accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandie, Pierre-André Durand, said to the news transmitter BFMTV that there had been no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby Hise could not be excluded. In the river, the prefecture explained that dust was built against pollution.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 2:40 a.m., the authorities reported. At first, the cause remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropole and is located between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany must invest and now"
The French Ministry of Economic and Finance Bruno Le Maire called on Germany to increase investments to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest, and the sooner the better it is," said Le Maire on Thursday night in the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
Action should be taken by those states who have budgetary spaces for more investment, said Le Maire, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these playrooms, added the minister and pointed to the high government debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French government debt must be "stabilised" and "sänkt", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to carry out more public investments in order to experience the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to remedy its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax eases of more than nine billion euros for households.
In this way, the French government inter alia responds to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The debt is supposed to decrease to 2.2 percent, expected 3,1 percent this year.
Does he try to tricks yet?: Johnson disregards the question of Brexit-Tactik
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the "Chaptation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law proposes the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos breach, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a hole, but in this way, the tory politicians disappear.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to carry out an unregulated brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly this.
The law provides that the government should apply for a change in the date of withdrawal, no agreement should have been reached with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political shakes" in order to avoid the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural strike that moved the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement".
Johnson's director Dominic Cummings explained that he feels the political controversies about Brexit as a "Spaziergang in the park" and proved confident that the desired EU exit will still be possible: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will (note that Red.: get out of the EU) do not worry," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" at a book presentation.
Cummings, who, during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" and now serves as a headstrategy at the United Kingdom Government's Downing Street. It is intended to put behind the compromiseless policy that led the Prime Minister into a very undisturbed situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it must not always be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) embarked deep into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was obviously proud and touched when he presented the video "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrated guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-France Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a refuge in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the emigration of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the immediate magic of the Polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids have made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
These are portraits, still life, landscapes, several Hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always the focus: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulder, calls in the bathing coat with a bit on his head or wears unformed moon boats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the shinelight on their farm in South England or in Scotland also led a very normal life. Thus, Mary McCartney said BBC that she had sleeped in a bed that her father had baked from old potatoes boxes. And it has not always been cleaned at the McCartneys.
Like no other medium, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decision Click: You have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you, and then you have to blink it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to catch the right moment always. "She just knew that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun Essay.
There is the light, the composition, the image section and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but, in addition to all, Anekdotics is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have already worked like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly placed Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
In spite of the US sanctions against Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not stop imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the United Nations Full Congregation.
However, Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems in importing Iranian oil, since some companies "have withdrawn because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran especially in this and in many other matters," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been following a "maximum pressure" policy against the Islamic Republic since its expiry from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly following a nuclear programme and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iran's oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.
U.S. government wants to limit the reception of refugees
The U.S. Government intends to drastically restrict the entry of refugees. On Thursday, the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the annual maximum of a resettlement programme was to be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at the present time, which corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens. The US immigration system is currently overloaded.
The U.S. Government will focus on the adoption of two refugee groups in the future: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reveals, and from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, at the same time, are to be included at a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees are selected from UN camps worldwide and relocated in the United States. The upper limit of 18.000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current maximum of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of US president Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House, left, the number was nearly 85,000.
Auxiliary organisations reacted unfortunately to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. Thus, the United States would continue to harm their leadership role in protecting the most injurious people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit the immigration to the United States - legally as illegally as well as strictly. The US Government expects its own details for the coming financial year 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separate from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a peak"
U.S. President Donald Trump has advocated announcers in the whistleblower affair of the spionage. Anyone who gives the informant who has abused power to him, "comes close to a tip," said Trump according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several US media in agreement.
Thus, Trump spoke in front of American UN mission staff. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he answered: "This is coming close to a tip." Then Trump added: "You know what we did in ancient times when we were wise? Right. The spies and betrayal, we were doing something different than we do now."
Observers valued the latter comment on a possible application to the death penalty. The democratics exercised sharp criticism of Trump's statements and cast him intimidation of witnesses. It was also a attempt to obstruct a Congress examination of a possible official consultation procedure against him, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision in the Representative House wrote.
The Whistleblower invites the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office in the summer to ask for an interference of another country into the US election 2020. Concrete is among other things about his controversial telephone with his Ukrainian official colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj: In the conversation, Trump approached him to initiate investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump commits any misbehavior.
However, as the New York Times reports, Whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of the CIA abroad secret service.
Refugee boat censured: Drink babys and babies in Egypt
Again and again, people are trying to get across the Egean Sea from Turkey to Greece, where they often know much too small boats. At the end of a hose boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died at the end of a hose boat. Among the death victims, there were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coastal guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be saved from the rivers from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims are supposed to be a locker, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants were broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
From which states the migrants are not known. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of Egeica, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee aid work (UNHCR) 174 people died on this route.
The Who Breaks the Concert
A US concert of the Rockband The Who has found a yearly end because of an insistence by Leadsanger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the event on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service. At the eighth song Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend apologize and supplemented that Daltrey could "n't really speak now". The audience promised Townsend to come to his expenses at a refund concert, but there is no date yet.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who abandoned. They are to be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cultivation band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly set: WeWork makes real estate markets trembling
WeWork has risen to the largest office rental in New York.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from the small startup to driving power on the world's most expensive real estate markets. However, now the company is in the crisis.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had discontinued a few days ago founder Adam Neumann as boss, deferred the planned stock exchange and started with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the leaders to win financial gambling for the next weeks and months. In addition, WeWork has stopped the completion of new rentals with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest tenant of office surfaces has suddenly been reported from the market.
WeWork hires large office areas in the long term and rents them in small units of members in part. This can be individual volunteers, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork has so far burned money with this business at stunning speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of $1,6 billion, at a turnover of $1,8 billion. This year alone the rent costs should have increased to an estimated 2.5 billion dollars. To limit the loss, the new company management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brake and stopped the rent of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with run-up periods of up to 15 years, resulting in obligations of over 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for all real estate markets.
According to the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork hired in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months nearly 300,000 square meters of office area. Only WeWorks New Contracts provided that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the new market sites in this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office lecture in the U.S. Metropole would have increased in this time, as Alpert in the "Business's Insiders" wrote. Similarly, WeWork looks in London, where WeWork has been operating several thousands of office locations in the best position.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeable without further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork is the main tenant, in the last year a deca for nearly 100 million euros purchased by the spare fund provider in the centre of the financial metropol.
Many tenants have rebuilt their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners must probably describe a part of the expected billion income. Access to the - anyway button - reserves of WeWork they haven't despite the long-term rental contracts. For the rental of the individual sites of WeWork usually takes place by each extra-based subsidiary, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only in close limits.
Russia once again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastal guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, there were 262 other wildfighters who had been illegally fished in the waters, the Russian domestic secret service FSB informed the Agency of Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. The Communist North Korea suffered from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. Russia’s coastal guard is driving according to its own information on the protection of its marine biological resources patrols. In the new controls, 30,000 ink fish were discovered. In addition, three fishermen and two motorboats have been captured and brought to Nachodka and Poshet at Vladivostok. According to Ria Novoosti, the Coast Guard has noted more than 8,000 infringements in 2018.
According to complaints by local entrepreneurs, the Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans. In 2019, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there in time.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Company in the remote eastern region Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fed with close synthetic networks banned in Russia. These would also bring small creatures from the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they need 200 years to be destroyed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian coastal guard were injured during the pre-week arrests. A also wounded North Korean man later died by the FSB at his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second after the fire opened.
U.S. entry prohibition against Ex-President Castro
The U.S. Ministry of Outdoors founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "great violations of human rights". As head of the Caribbean Communist Party, he advocated a system where thousands of Cubans would be willingly arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the forces, the brother of the dead Revolution leader Fidel Castro was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the persistent crisiss in Cuba and Venezuela," twitted the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had pronounced prohibitions on entry among others against members of the Venicezolan government and the military. In Venezuela, for months, a bitter battle of power between the government and the opposition has been incurred by the United States. The United States has imposed a number of sanctions against the Government of Maduro to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-named interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allied Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for services sent to doctors. According to the U.S. and the V.A. opposition, Cuba also sent a number of secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government to suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the road for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the movement plans to react to actions and advertising in thousands of countries worldwide. The beginning is expected to be due to the shift in New Zealand and Australia, before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale research in Canadian Montreal. Even before the White House in Washington, protesters wanted to gather.
How much the world's commitment to this Friday after the record participation of the previous week will be, is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was good things. "The last Friday over four million people have been busy for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries, supplemented them.
Especially in Germany, the past Friday was very large. A good third of all worldwide demonstrations - about 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates from Fridays for Future. This time a list of movements have been planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as young people in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the street for climate.
Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 at the age of 15 in order to encourage politicians in their country to make more efforts to climate protection. Thunberg developed in a short time the movement of Fridays for Future. Participating in the climate protests are especially students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they are calling for more ambitions in the fight against earth heating and the threatening climate disaster, and in particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global heating must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived in New York nearly a month after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea rainy hunt. There she had last participated in the United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday, she held an emotional speech at the UN, in which she spoke deeply into conscience to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was addressed on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, the Russian people are not allowed to smoke on the balcony. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker of the Ministry of Disaster in Moscow on Thursday, following the Agency Tass. The prohibition is to take effect on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, must expect a money penalty of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should uncover a fire, then the punishment will be higher. According to the ban, the Ministry will fall as burning candles. Also meat sprays on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Battle against cyber criminals - Detectives exhaust servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German detectors for the first time exposed a large server provider for illegal businesses in the Darknet.
A total of 13 actors are suspected to have hosted numerous websites at the Mosel as operators of an accounting centre in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trarbach, through the international criminals operated their make-ups.
This was announced by the General State Advocate in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested at a large action on Thursday night. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are supposed to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", who had destroyed researchers in the spring. The attack on 1,25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the General State Advocate.
Such a hoster had been removed for the first time in Germany, it said. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access operation with support for special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and in the neighbouring abroad. It had been a result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the researchers want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the movement planned Fridays for Future again actions and advertising environments in thousands of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Yuchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests ▶ Who are actually Thunberg's Hintertians?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. So surprising that a 16-year-old girl calculates that the powers of this time keep the mirror before the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing of a climate activityist? Historical masterial performance or manipulative tactics for herself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and adolescents for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt excorded to work for a fairer world. At that time, he was able to win a lot of young people for himself and convinces them to cross the sea to get into the praised country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently traveled to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a share named "We don't have time" to save the world? Besides, Greta Thunberg has rich PR-Manager on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has largely sold itself, thanks to the daughter standing in the ramplight. Also old-famous followers of Greta Thunberg were a little distressed over the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably also set up some followers too tight. This is not unfounded, because the action came into the media worldwide very well and there is a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now divorcing: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially in saving the world? Is it even authentic when certain circles of individuals work together with stock makers during the World Restoration Action? No matter what position is finally involved, a critical and reflected viewpoint is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can also seem to make meaningful to consider some of the trends' projects.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: a foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Lange the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently active in the world astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Komet was discovered by amateur astronomers on the Krim
The said body was discovered by a amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Krim. He looked with a self-builded telescope to heaven and further follow-ups confirmed his first suspect. It is actually an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. It is only the second of his type that was seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to shake insights into a foreign solar system from the vicinity. It seems to be similar to our own system, as reported by the Canary Astrophysical Institute. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) it is clearly interstellary origin and is currently moving to a so-called hyperbel path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before flight - and can be monitored several months
But before it is done, the astronomers can closely observe him. In contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the highest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority of Nasa. "After that it will only be seen by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge of Komet 2I/Borisov raise hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 km diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our cometes - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expressed it, the spectrum of the sweat star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our, supplemented the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly busy with researchers. Only recently, a giant asteroid rushed over the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson disturbed by brother
About Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, and now his sister, with clear words, cited the Prime Minister's war language as "smakless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Bructure", the Treaty: Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands under pressure and always rests up - at least verbally. At the question hour in the suburb this Wednesday, this was a massive resentment of the opposition, and in the meantime more critics have reported: Thousands of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the Sender Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of a EU exit should be "hanged, longed, divided, teared and feathered". They think that is extremely absurd. They do not recognize the version of her brother again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had arrived in the elections to the EU parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she advocated that her brother Jo Cox mentioned a EU-friendly sub-home delegate who had been murdered by a neonazi in 2016, and whose memories could best be honored by crossing the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the sub-home. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called the British first," now criticized Johnson's sister. The transgressor was evidently coming from the right-extreme camp, which felt "through this kind of language" strengthened. For all those who were sorrowing about them, if it was very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he twitted. The best way to honor them is to passionately and determined to what you believe - no matter what view you are. But never can you "demonize the other side". He also complained that a atmosphere was arising from being more likely in the attacks.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had put down his office as state secretary and his mandate as a tory delegate. "I was broken between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an unresolvable tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language was also in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy". In a common statement they stated: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside the Parliament, was not acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: in the half-time show of the coming Super Bowl two women with Latino roots appear. The promises "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will be delivered the half-time show at the coming finale of the US Football Liga NFL. This was given by the organisers on Thursday (place time).
"I feel incredible and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira informed in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2. In the metropole at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is puerto-rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on the stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy."
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents were emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November.
Shakira was known as the star of a telenovela and singer in Colombia. Her global breakthrough created her first two-language album in 2001 and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time with tension. This year many are also considered the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest US porter event and at the same time a giant advertising spectacle. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided birds there. Normally, the NFL Final looks at far over 100 million TV viewers, it is also very popular in Germany now.
Last year, there was political controversy. The cause was the struggle about the Quarterback Colin Kaprenick, who had refused from protest against police violence against blacks, while playing the national hymne, and had been severely addressed by President Donald Trump, among other things. From solidarity with Kaapernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl event - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group of Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
A actress and youtuber associate Egypt’s ruler: First, Mohamed Ali would rather stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on the return of blood on the streets of Egypt have spent both abroad the last week. One of the two had swept again at the Cairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who in 2013 left the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected state leader of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: U.S. President Donald Trump had praised Sisis' action against the political Islam and no silb about human rights infringements on the Nile - in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had waved to protest against the presidents. He said: "No reason to worry," Sisi at the airport in the national television microphones. "The Egyptians were not able to lead into the Irs.
In the wrong way - that is what the President of the other man, who is currently trying to determine what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali was of course in abroad, where he withdraws from the access of the security forces that would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian ground. A few weeks ago, the 45-year-old actress was known as a minority of the Egyptians. Today, Ali is the tongue voice that exalts the political discourse in the cafés, dominates the living rooms and theestubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his countrymen up against Sisi.
While the people are hungry, the president swallows in the luxury and lets himself build beautiful new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi is based on his rule, promotes corruption and enrichment. Because he did 15 years in his second profession as a builder with precisely these men's businesses, he seems to know quite precisely what he is talking about - that is at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the explosive click numbers show.
After the last week, since Sisis's grip had been demonstrated thousands of people against his rule, and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for this Friday to a "million march". That really would risk so many people on the streets, was unlikely. But there came to a few smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants were preparing for Al-Sisi corruption and demanding its departure. In these protests, the police also set up tear gas and rubber boots. These videos did not prove themselves independently. From security circles, the police said that the protests had ended.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where protesters rise in pieces with the president's portrait last week Banner, on Friday massive police presence was reported. Security forces built in the city and on the defeat streets. In Kairo several subway stations were closed in the city for "conservation work", most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa site, on which the adherents of the crashed Muslim brother Mursi in 2013, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another action should prevent us from gathering unsatisable: Sisis Future Party wanted to hold out a wide range for the presidents.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us meet police officers." But as a retreator, it was not to understand: "All Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
When the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than purchased by the provider, there are various testing possibilities.
If you conclude an Internet contract, you do not need to trust the speed data of the providers blindly. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved in case of notice.
Finally, the previously promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, says the Consumer Centre Bayern.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider's purchase, there are various testing possibilities. Thus the Messtools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the suppliers are, however, carried out in accordance with supplier specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the consumer centre Bayern on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set an appropriate period of 14 days to make the promised performance. This is the best way to make the subjects written by enclosure.
If this does not work after multiple requests, customers can terminate and may also require damage replacement. However, if success remains, only the way of complaints will help.
First ranked Republicans for investigation
As the first ranked Republican, the governor of Vermont has pronounced himself for an investigation of impeachment against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from here, is determined by the facts that are detected," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before actions - a Impact Procedure can lead to the closure of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by disclosures that Trump repeatedly invited Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to investigate interventions by the democratic president and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed bids "for years".
Republics have hidened with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have detected discomfort for this. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as against the deterioration of environmental protection regulations and the reinforcement of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Further Marvel movie
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Thus, Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" university. Fullly unclear how it should go on with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man is given after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This reports in agreement with several US media. Thus the film start is to be found in the United States: the film is to start from 16 July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's way is continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are very happy that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play with in various universes, since Sony continues working on his Spidey verses. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is supposed to have offered an offer. According to industry magazines, the group of Disney, including Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of the coming SpiderMan films. However, the message is not confirmed.
Thus Duke Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits"-Final
After nine staffels, the series "Suits" in the United States is now reached at the big finale. In the last sequence there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo occurrences. And also the royal couple of Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, was dulled in a charming way. Note that the following sections contain spoilers for the seriesfinale.
One way ahead: Duchess Meghan did not return for a final greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some looks showed the most memorable scenes with today's heroin. For example, the moments of the failure and the successful wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his suspended prison.
But even her husband, Prince Harry, was occasionally mentioned in the "Suits"-Final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight in the direction of altar to marry his engaged Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a multi-speaking comment on his suit. Whether he has actually thrown himself over a gorgeon, the consumed Harvey wants to know from the bridegy, only to make a gentle comment: "Louis, you are not the prince of England."
Agriculture: Drink baby and four other children in the event of boat accident
A baby and four other children are drowned in a refugee boat in the Aegean. A total of seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastal guard informed on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the east of Egeica. Last year came on this route according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance (UNHCR) 174 people to live. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that they want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent EU Commissioner, in Turkey, he wants to "investigate the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday, and then in Athens he wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to help deal with the situation.
On Friday, a spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned journey of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusual numbers of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The increase in numbers made the EU-Turkey agreement, which was concluded in 2016, in the last case, doubts arising from the functioning of all refugees and migrants who are going illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands, and that is, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrian disposed.
However, the processing of asylum applications is very difficult on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, there are almost 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people are currently 5200 migrates.
Never since the EU-Turkey refugee pact entered into force in March 2016, so many have been reported by the State Round Radio.

Green politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo pans
The Chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the electoral campaign - was manipulated for this reason of the cups?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multiway cup in hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Kanada - It has been quite long unnoticed - and finally noticed. The re-useable coffee cup with metal trohhalm has never been held in hand by Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website, she was on a photo to see with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and was also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a gentleer (Pap) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Chief must be responsible for photo pans
The National Post then sent May to manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible in the subject of environmental protection. And that in the middle of a election campaign for the underhouse choice, where Trudeau also has increasingly difficulties because of a squirrel scandal.
The photo went into the social media viral and fought the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a contrast of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their one-way cups."
May showed itself shocked and delighted on her blog to have nothing known of this action. To underline this, she posted to the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, the one put her right, was from Bambus. She always told him. A speaker of the party said it was just about spending the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo is only a cut to see on the website.
May writes that it makes her suffering for the staff who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked herself something from her over-taken team: "If they would like to handle a picture again, they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens were also advised for their use of single-way plastics or flights in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at vacation Ice with plastic spoons, as Merkur.de* reported.
Influencing wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was assured by e-mail by Cathay Pacific to upgrade. But when she asked for it at the check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they have luck and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-declared influencer actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On 30 May, it returned from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the departure, Jaqueline rejected an upgrade, although she showed an e-mail in which her Cathay Pacific claimed to put an upgrade in view. The letter wants to have received the influence from an airline marketing staff. However, the Airline accuses Jaqueline of faking the mail.
On the return, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-range flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The JFK airport employees were skeptical: they hunted at the centre. And in fact, the employee who claimed to come from the mail should have discounted the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system where the messages did not appear.
The Airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocate, a company representing consumer interests. Although Cathay had reimbursed the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the costs for the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed influential fraud, it remains locked for future flights. The conditions of the Airline also state that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy it - and now turns a lawyer on.
Oil prices in Yemen according to the report on a state of arms
The oil prices fell within the shortest time on Friday afternoon by more than one dollar. Recently, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea varieties of Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 per cent less than the previous day. The price for a barrier of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 per cent to 55.77 dollars.
As a result of the course, the Wall Street Journal was a report on a gun stop in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a gun stop in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels connected with Iran in the country of civil war had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, was responsible for Iran. A gun stop would expose the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually achieved, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the News Agency Bloomberg.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement in the past days. A week ago a barrel WTI oil had still cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost $65.
Bloomberg had recently reported on Insider that after the attack in mid-September, the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia was more rapidly advanced than thought. Thus, the production volume was again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases called on Insiders, reporting on rapid progress from the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to plan a stock exchange and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after Iran's festival and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure, while the ship continues to lie before anchor, Reedereichef Erik Hönell informed the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the United States announced that defence missiles and soldiers should be moved to the Iranian archipelago to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and Great Britain had temporarily increased the oil prices in recent weeks.
Prosecutions against Trumps Strengthen
In the affair of potential power abuse by U.S. President Donald Trump, there have been propositions against the White House. Several leaders of the government would have tried intensely to prevent access to the wording of the conversation at the end of July after a conflicting telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. This explained an anonymous pointer. The speaker of the representative house, the democratic Nancy Pelosi, was thrown forward to the White House explicitly "remotion". Trump spoke of a "hex hunting".
North Korea considers the third Summit of Trump and Kim to be questioned
North Korea has made doubts that in the nuclear battle it will soon come to a third summit of power holder Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The meaning and success of such a meeting will be questionable because of the lack of progress in the implementation of the first summit in Singapore, said the top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the KCNA Agency.
The United States had not yet done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the advisor of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He also criticized reinforced US sanctions and the joint military manöver of the United States and South Korea, but he hopes for a "wise" and "move" decision of Trumps to return to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was to bring before he was ready to explain it. The negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean Atomic and Raket Programme have been held in Hanoi since the failing second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both of them met in the enmilitarized zone between the two Korean States. They agreed to relive the discussions, but so far without major success.
Prince Harry: Arms manufacturers are supposed to help in mining
With a blue splinter protection west, the British prince Harry in Angola symbolically burned and destroyed a bomb. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the place Dirico, he made the fire circuit. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola free of mine until 2025, he later asked before running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names stand on these weapons, but who did not help to remove them to help us."
Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
British Pound under pressure
In view of a rapid decline in interest, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a short decline of the Bank of England (BoE) adds to the pounds of sterling. The British currency agreed up to 0.4 per cent on Friday to $1.2269.
The sales triggers were the statements of the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought a decline in interest, even if a chaotic brexit could be reversed, as the insurance would affect the British conjunction at an absurd time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders was valid for a restrictive monetary policy, said Analytist Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burden on the economy by the Brexit hickhack, without signaling a direct reduction of interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country without a separation agreement from the EU on 31 October.
More: With his provokations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it might pay for him, says tradeblad editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Showing other Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analysis Labor is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the unilateral director of the World Anti-Athy-Agency (Wada) and today the head of integrity of the Light Athletic World Association.
At the beginning of the light athlete WM, new details of the Doping Scandal in Russia appear - and they destroyed the few credibility that Russian sports had gained at the beginning of the year and had only been re-winning. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labor finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had locked the Russian Antidoping agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not entirely banned by the world arts. The International Olympic Committee reads after individual examination at the summer games in 2016 in Rio about 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to attend at the World Cups in the different sports, in the summer in Russia the FusssballWM even took place with the host as participants.
No positive findings
In September, the Wada re-established the Rusada band, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples that were said. The data should provide information about the extent of doping cases in the state baptism. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athlete Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow Analysis Labor was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check if the task force received the correct data," said David Howman in the Interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" of Friday. "We have detected many discrepancies between the data that the Wada was given by a whistleblower and those who received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light Athletic Association holds as the only organization on Russian ban. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes under neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already placed in the space and invited Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens the recess of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympics in 2020 in Tokyo.
