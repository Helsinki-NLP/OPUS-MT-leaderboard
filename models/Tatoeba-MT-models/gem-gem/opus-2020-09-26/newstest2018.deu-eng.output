Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An irrational institution where youths are supposed to meet today.
A crop chapel, where now is buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Clay gardens manage the unique ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's nervous when maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone who had to excite himself, knows this because the car-Navi instead of a circuit road showed a green grass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are everything other than the current - but that is why they are very exciting.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flicking carpet that you do not recognize as such.
The large overview map included more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called original sheets.
These were created, according to the Bayerische Messungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864, and originated in the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted a overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayern in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally declined with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: It was the neighbours of today who created the idea of an area covering Bayern card.
Courfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" and thus the Bayerian measuring management.
The original form for Munich comes from the year 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek like all others.
The comparison Early/Today is the most incredible example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is the subsender who appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was communicated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munchner district.
Today, substitute is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of consignors are focused around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at the first view: when zooming in, a smaller map appears with dozen lines and numbers: manually numbered walk pieces from the so-called "reception" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels are no longer farmers - but clothing gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun".
A large green area depicts the north of a subsendant.
The Theresiense, since the October festival in 1810, was actually a grass - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original sheet, you can read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen, not only the street name "am guesteig" or from the height "On the Lifts" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with crazy ideas.
In 1858/59 the Munchner Circle Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Liften" was created.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gottden led the establishment - that psychiatrist, which is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of the so-called irrations.
He has also prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt.
At first, 280 patients had been placed, later expanded to 500 places.
Sometimes this capacity did not extend - the reason for the construction of the circular iron facilities in hair in 1905.
There has been the Isar-Amper-Clinicum Munich-Ost since 2006, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training operations.
West is the football square of the TSV Munich East, eastern housing houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural relief to the original building of the Irren Institute, which had been destroyed in the Second World War at bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Haupt Platz" at 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change also brought the Second World War into the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of the Allies ripped many holes into the city centre.
A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a crop chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the pre-works and on 5 April 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn strait.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today's air picture - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group published Travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colored people who travel to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is supposed to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to give extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have last occurred and are listed here in the group's opinion."
A recent law adopted by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the criminal prosecution authorities of the State, which aim unproportionately for minorities, caused the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that people pass.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are being merged or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in doubtful circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no longer petrol during his journey through the state and was preserved by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from the Office of the Advocate General of Missouri, which shows that black car drivers in the state are more frequently held than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be ready to bring money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."
In 2015 Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hatred crime report programme, which classified the state to the 16th rank of the country in relation to the number of such injuries.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to complain a company about housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws, obliged local criminal prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration infringements, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further race profile.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weideson project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezan project is a success project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU Friday delegates Peter White and Kordula Kovac have got an image on site.
At the courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU Places Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights in his company, where he manages 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 milk cows and as many young animals and accommodated holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Schwarzzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests only comes regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezane project "elementary".
I can't make profits on such squirrels.
The greenland area ensures a lot of work, many things must be processed with the motor sense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not operate bioavailable.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezane project and is happy with the support of Leaders."
For costs of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare, farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that the forestification of the areas could be pulled out for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate," the mayor stressed.
The farmers are often in criticism because of promotion.
In 2013, there were a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants in the field of breeding.
The open-up area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be cultivated until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded over Leader, a quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of breeding.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the toes," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and farmers it is not possible."
Peter White also stated: "The best food is being produced here."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the State to promote Weidezäunen.
The aim is to keep the black forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a couple referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be consumed must not be swallow-managementable (excessive 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the forest.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezan project 2018, the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 parcels, which want to build nearly 16 kilometers of cage.
The surface is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully incredience of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a hot fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President for drastic restriction of legal immigration to the statue of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have tightened him if he had.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the significance attributed to her, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base.
When Miller Acosta screwed: "I don't want to discuss a complete thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he himself made it, it is not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the exciting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tireds, your arms, / your troubled masses who desire to breathe freely, / the evil waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "earning waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps are not welcome to the USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who tried to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they did a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female body of freedom in an abused classical representation.
Lazarus changed this significance: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of exiles.
The link of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great screehal Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the freedom statue invites no one, but rather is an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the overnighted world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It is supposed to be carrying the flavour of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The flash should not light the road to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great fascinating act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips to the decks of ships.
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome that they must hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their flakes shall not light the way, but shall inflammate the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two shots belonged to the British team
Neil Black, head of performance athletics in the United Kingdom, says that the 16-headed schottic quota in the world championship framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "you have to develop something special in Scotland" and the light athlete of the United Kingdom has to learn from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scotian athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British light athlete: It has something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy on the street neck.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scotian athletes are medal adversaries, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will be approached against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were schottic or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join the 400-m heads at her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British crew.
Scotland's best number of athletes in the World Championship to date was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The medium-range runner Muir is leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot was at Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team says that she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team but, in some cases, also part of the medals and finals.
"The special feature of being team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, making it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Certainly I am very proud of all the scots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podies.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympia Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Do not buy for a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of choosers
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from internal politics to its political principles.
He screwed in the criticism, surely.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him about this early week.
The staff of the governor released the complaint as free, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republic governor in a surprisingly popular democratic state.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the direction of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his choosers and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hated people who swing the whiskeys online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a practitioner, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Advocate Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crime.
"I kindly commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment field of the "The Post" news post.
"I don't appreciate this idea, even if a number of people comment on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "pre-language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidance articles or to arrest demonstrations and to silence.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first official who is criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is charged by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to the US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplyed between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers enrolled his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and disputes are part of the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European no. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope home comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next to Archerfield Links before losing Paul Eales, is connected to the new exhibition site and operates as a tourism messenger in the name of the Confederator and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous contester of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The Englishman Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won in his 32-year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the home-owned player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open, since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returned to action on home floor.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad how it has gone so far."
With the trio on the field, the former Masters-Best Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking area costs £5 per car with one inmate and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less lung cancer deaths by passive smoke
In the past two decades, fewer people have died from lung cancer because of passive smoke.
The result is that scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study.
"After our estimates, 167 lung cancer cases per year are due to passive smokes," said Study Manager Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he studied this topic in 1994.
At that time, there were 400 pulmonary cancer cases in Germany as a result of passive smoke per year.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove very complex
The construction work in the Villinger Street is in full gangs and "is somewhat in the time," says the head of Fred Heinze Building.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since in the underground much is hidden, which was not recorded in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly obstacles the construction work, represents a major problem for the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of the car drivers from red ampels and locker grids is already huge," says Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp company have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were very hard already.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt provided us with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kodorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she won't use a flock.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the distressed Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potatoe - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the cold knob is taken with zealous, unwashed hands and swallowed.
Degei sits on the lehmboden - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with dirty water from the nearby soap.
A eimer in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to run around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was introduced in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elders were to vote in front of the crew forces by a public collection of hands.
An existing movement, which touched on independence against Dutch rule, turned quickly against the government of Jakarta, who maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as distant as it is. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province capital to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive with the car rental.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees and of waveblack roofs converted by rust into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, silent than journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
"We were not used to wearing this clothing," says Degei, indicating their lively, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"Before we had only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of the people live under poverty and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
Freeport alone, in 2015, declined in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources in the value of estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an embarrassing presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million dollars of local military members and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal shockland in the 1970s became a genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We will lose everything" says in a report by the Erzdiezese Brisbane from 2016, which contains reports on the horrors of the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as events occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased since Papua's resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is a Christian population of 83%, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanic warning edges sell brown chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai inhabitant who moved to Jayapura, the province capital.
"It cost the local papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian state president Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the Volksmund, promised the inequalities and infringements in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former chamber secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua has little changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowis dedication in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs before a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The scared children told them that they should turn on their shines.
One of the soldiers stood at their sound and later returned with four soldiers, says local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and struck the group with their gun bullets, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was burned and the things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football square in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and introduced the waita dance - running in the circle and a bird song imitating - by Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrations began to throw stones on police and military posts.
When the atmosphere was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says a official document by TIME, which has not been released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto quarter of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for rest and asked the quantity to return home.
No one was listening to the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left hand joint," he said TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the balls came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and investigated his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only carry a name that TIME in dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station only because it was being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of Papua Polizei, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrations were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta until the next day 'filtered'.
Three weeks, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he set up an unjustified mechanism for fixing historical violations of human rights.
But the excuses almost started immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to deal with these violations, but there are processes that must be undergoed," he said.
Then Wiranto took a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are legally regulated," he said.
Wiranto, who was accused of "mistress against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already attached, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai sacrifices accepted such claims with brutal ignorance.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After I had buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he said.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The 24 - year - old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Rebelled village inhabitants protested from the company's location office.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But inhabitants say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started to shoot on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panic, we are afraid that there will be vengeance," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was a witness as the injured ones were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament called on the involved officers to take account of and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the territory.
Paniai was always an alarm for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribals of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the Rebel Army, who claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the Top-OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and willingly preserved under the suggestion of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is likewise out of reach.
The people here build everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leave vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the local papua and the new migrants have grown, which have been increasing since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better trained and richer migrants.
Papua has rarely the capital or the necessary capabilities to manage its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting continue to be stressed on international media.
In the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the vice-president of the Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis' election campaign to remove the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's most distressed eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "mistaking and widespread injuries" in Papua, including paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically seen support for OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the arguments of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4th, broke their silence and urged him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to attend the meeting but remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, except that they live under the constant threat of a robbery military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai Scout victims carried out a last symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on an area precisely against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get righteousness, but at least they will not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lower head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire capture the 'Torch' cloud scratcher of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire found his doorbook in Dubai in one of the world's highest dwelling towers and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high, 79-store buildings.
It is the second fire that in just two years is featuring through the high house, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Turm).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have slept and we have risen at the fire alarm and when the people are screaming.
We ran down the staircase, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a inhabitant who stated his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection Authority said that the units of fire combating at 4:00 p.m. local time (0:00 GMT) cleared the fire and cooled off the building.
The government said it was working on the provision of accommodation for the subjects.
The event can re-establish questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of highhouses worldwide.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from dressing, external clothing to decoration or isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and dressing at the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed in June to the rapid expansion of a fire, where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: More Best of Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has fallen through with his large Davis Cup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the Ho Chi Minh City meeting, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the necessary two-third majority of Davis-Cups only to play on two profits.
The five-sat classics are often very long, but they are also very appreciated by this reason, so the traditional application remains to be maintained.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform; therefore, the objective of the ITF president David Haggerty was very closely missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
You will continue to work on improving the application.
After many objections, the proposal to carry out the final to a neutral place had not even been taken to vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: So the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs of the organisers, the requirements on training sites etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media termine before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring banned items into the plane, finding out a survey
A flight passenger survey showed that more than 20 per cent consciously or unconsciously prohibited objects were smuggling past the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent which entered the plane while wearing accidentally forbidden knifes or other objects with rings.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered lately that they were wrongly traveled with shooting weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey in more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers rather disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most frequent items that were deliberately slaughtered by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 per cent admitted, knowingly carrying objects with rings through safety control, while 2.2 per cent of female surveyers and 3.7 per cent of male surveyers also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said it asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many would have done it deliberately.
It is not surprising that the people who carry the most best smuggling - knowingly or unaware - were the most frequently flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about the liquids they can take or how much of it.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest quantity of the liquids prohibited by the TSA are.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Cancel Ten thousands of Tesla customers Order
Elon Musk is happy to provide the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unobligatory reservation.
In addition to the always triumphing figures on turnover increases and even more huge market targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time suggested another, less glossy number when announced the latest quarterly balance: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often bought over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.
Now Musk admits: 63,000 of the total 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critists have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-obligatory reservations.
At a cancellation, Tesla will pay the EUR 1000 (in the United States $1,000 and in the United Kingdom $1,000) "reservation payment" completely back.
At present, 455.000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analytists.
However, the Tesla-Chef does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 is supposed to be - all models together - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand is evident.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently available per day.
Nowadays, a "model 3" order can expect to be delivered at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its nail new production roads that have never been in practice without major interruptions with maximum exhaustion.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in scars.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws because of delaying the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Head of the Environmental Protection Authority, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Ära rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog caused air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved the needs of the state environmental authorities to reaction faster as previous administrations.
He did not mention the appeal that had been raised against his previous office in a federal court.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for soiling ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "mixing into local decisions or disabling economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reverse of Wednesday is the latest legal relapse for the Pruitts regulator rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA manager had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama Administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks.
In a opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turning around ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States by means of the complex process of proper compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited for the accusation of activist groups and others, and in an agreement fixing the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who declared the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that exists to us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use his "requirement to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "base on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans at the Congress urge a more comprehensive reconstruction of the ozone rules.
A legislative draft approved in the last month is intended to delay the implementation of 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the Senate to vote.
New York General State Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states which the EPA had accused this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reverse of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of public health and environmental protectioners rejoiced over surprising course change in pruitts.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological cruise of the Trump Government, offering environmental pollutors and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: At the anniversary of the Church of the Mountains, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday 16 July at 16.30.
Whether his idyllic location and a beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz serenade can be confused by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique smaller town."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Kapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergic document book: Graf Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vaktei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the document appeared on the Tumlinger Mountain, except the unique parish church, also a dominant court, which belonged to the Church or the Patronate law and not reversed.
So people also lived there.
According to the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are currently recognized in the local image of Tumlingen today, the "Berg" was the third, the dominant settling core of the village.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 support these historical situations.
The cartridge law was created from the early medieval own church law.
A master who built, equipped and occupied a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
The right to use a priest or to propose a new parish to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two broke on Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be issued in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were beaten and stolen the bell seals.
The roof was nowhere.
In 1796, French troops stored near the church.
They broke out the candles and church chairs and used them as burning wood.
Remnants of the church threatened to crash in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearswearers.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilarius abandoned.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year Night of 1834, a storm divided the church tower and half crashed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was cancelled.
Only the current tower thorn remained a witness of the 750 - year - old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "safe pensioners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn are the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen are invited on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilarius chapel.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local ruler Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Introduction is from 15.30 p.m.
In order to sound the Serenade, a circumvent will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Give a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view of the weeds to the forest," the organisers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organisers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius system, which is important for tumling and hearing disorders.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to the home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have the approval of wind wheels checked
"Boisheim reverses" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The Boisheim Association has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its authorisation for the creation of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The Association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time of four only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border at Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are essentially possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone leads to an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind-power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the area-use plan - which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning conditions, the issued authorisation is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim's rejection".
Current status of things: The City Council has decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a approval of the district government is still abandoned.
Recognition: "This is whereby the granting of an authorisation for the establishment of wind energy plants is legally excluded."
The circle confirms the entrance of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been entered to the fourth circle since last week," said one speaker.
The circuit takes it to the opportunity to review the matter again.
However, they are not expected to stop the procedure.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circuit did not intend to comment on the argumentation of the Association "Boisheim" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four wind wheels every 200 meters on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Foursen is indirectly involved had concluded pact contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large area.
The establishment of the four wind energy plants aims to cover the electricity needs of approximately 11 400 households - which correspond to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. at L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreiz).
A woman was hurt deadly.
Two other persons were easily injured.
The country road remained locked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the course of the accompanying ride with her 53-year-old mother as a accompanyer took the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and dealer plan "Homeshops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are about to re-discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants for shopping bummel into the city centre.
As the chairman of the Commerce Association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekend is to make customers aware of what offers the city is offering from the usual supermarket goods.
Thus, a market is planned with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the businesses of the city are supposed to invite to the midnight shops.
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation are advertising spots in the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian King.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Trade.
With this, the trade association and the city go to another stage of the "Attractive Innenstadt" project.
These include new offers such as the first “Active Day” for the well party as the open-sale Sunday, conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be re-established or re-established.
These include courier guests and tourists.
But many inhabitants would also have lost the city in shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to help live the city – up to tenants, the holdings of the whole city and associations.
It was true to overcome the lethargy, which was partly broadened, with a network king had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK centre in Mühlhausen, informed that on the bottom of the third "Homeshops" day, five Thüringer cities first participated.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy Town and Bleicherode.
The day was to "advertent for the appreciation of local trade and show its importance to the community of our cities", said Strict.
The action under the management of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen with his purchase behaviour can influence his own direct environment.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
At a gas explosion in the US city Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more injured, some of them difficult.
According to the firefire, on Wednesday (local time) a injured person was still in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A suspect was later also kept dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the time of the holiday, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on telephone calls after broken transcripts Mexico because of the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump in a telephone with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The president of the U.S. stated that he was blaming the wall publicly. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "shameful", "mys" and "dumb" and that the existence of the trade that was communicated by the Government Obama would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massacher: Activists bring back racist Lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury traveled through a group of audiences in rural Monroe, Georgia, and went to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns appeared to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the wind protection disc.
Inside, the inmates swooped in fear.
"We want this n ----r Roger!" screamed the man.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Scream broke the silence when a young black man was screwed out of the accompanying seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a show.
But then, when a snare is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all of the audience's very real suctions are exhausted.
Since 2005, civil lawyers have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were knocked by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"It is truly incredible that in all these years no one person has been arrested - although we see it in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the posting.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congress delegate of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil lawyer.
For him, it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to receive justice," he said.
"We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness."
A court doctor lays a bed linen over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although suspects have remained free for decades, civil lawyers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the Black Citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time at the pre-elected campaign in summer.
Approximately at the same time as the choice, the FBI stated that the black farmer Roger Malcom was a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - supposedly due to a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," includes a FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a complot between the state and local criminal persecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and disguised the identity of witnesses."
Brooks formulates it even more pragmatic.
"It was an electoral maker," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you are registered and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual release of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their presentation is incredible, and is founded in a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe that it is no longer existing in America.
It's hard to look at, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lightning, because we are then confronted with his horribleness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-rolled overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-regisseur.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role never becomes easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams and pushs him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughs.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't believe that white people then said a --- he."
"But" was one of the other black actors.
"You just have to meet the hard R."
And right there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of companionship replaces the unpleasantness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repeat ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a grief dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and leads Billie Holidays sadly lounge "Strange Fruit".
Their voice breaks with every second word.
Approximately 100 meters behind it, a group of about four dozen viewers wipes out of the eyes and tears.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple is coming from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many come down the street only.
They have all experienced Georgia’s pushing moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels splendid.
When the last notes of the song drop out, Greene invites the quantity to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hook on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it is over.
The actors throw away the Lynch seal and wash their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then weeps together in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience joins the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is stimulated about the presentation with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left the sensation behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and acts ... to come from people who look like you yourself and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lightning is still going on," she added, "now it is called just a police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brook's Court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he's already started planning the performance next year.
"The sensation is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's true if we don't learn from it, then it can happen again.
Who does not study his own story, who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat it."
The Wagnerian in Bayreuth was reconciled by "god damning"
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets on a bunt-frivol inscension before giant, six-store scenes.
The turnbow (made by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shameful street neck as well as wall rest and danerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-old-time parks where the Rhine Dogs pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels recall Castorf's lead motive - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" inscension.
The three pure dogs - singing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess deceives Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), crushed a body in Hollywood Manier in the bagroom and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously fine Hagen, which surrounds the Aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus oak) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Sturmly celebrated Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski, who is modest and shaking hands to Merkel-Rout.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra that appears for the first time on the stage - in view of the great heat again in lower recreational clothing.
It was expected to appear with tension by Frank Castorf and his government team.
If he had to have a valid peif concert on himself in 2013, there was a great joy, five years later, in which the single "Buh" call was undermined.
Sheriff Katharina Wagner must have enjoyed it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said just before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also become an understanding of its viewpoint.
I'm moving a positive reception.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture stock, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already worked on school in the open whole day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late volunteer.
Why is that?
Amount: I made an abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, cancelled successfully.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there can be seen how it is in place, perhaps in the focus, really.
And was it so?
Amount: I've collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social study during the winter semester.
I'm going to study twice, probably do a social worker training at Herne's Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Education.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use during volunteer service?
Amount: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always dependent on where to make your FSJ.
You can make it from the home of age to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
With me, it was very varied.
I was also partially in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really went.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: Surely, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people shaped heads that have a very different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always enter into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touching anxiety?
Amount: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so is life just.
Pearson shortens further 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividend to relive the business
On Friday, the British Education Group Pearson said that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate divisions by 72 percent, since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure faced by the company.
In addition to his previous restructuring, general director John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, his previous restructuring was already lost.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan of 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to recover a business taken by the fast step to digital learning.
The company that had sold its participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the view for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2,05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack of Kabul: Nato-Soldat killed in suicide attack
A suicide offender attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of Nato and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured, an explanation of the Nato announced.
According to local reports, three civilians died in the event in the district of Qarabagh.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
A NATO opinion states that the explosion had happened on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "explosed explosion carried by persons".
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for the NATO troops in the nearby bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobomb killed at least 30 people in a chitical district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31th, a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most fatal military attack of the country since the US troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban from power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their politics, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA turns the decision to delay the smog rule to complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has suspended a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's Government, which requires the States to reduce the smog-causing emissions, a day after the 15 states declared the Agency for the step.
In late Wednesday, the EPA announced the decision to promote the so-called "Ozone Destinations 2015" and said that it showed the Agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and in our reaction to our government partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in an explanation.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intends to delay the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, is intended to stimulate economic growth.
However, efforts have caused the relapse of democracies and nature protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that inhalation of air that contains ozone "can reduce the lung function and enhance the breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
The municipality wants Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: in the case of two contradictions, the municipality of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a Community area in the future senior dwelling plant.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will last until the so far belonging area of the church community is in the municipal possession, there is no longer any planning obstacle to the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to meet the community.
At the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality suggest that such a Community area is not just a meeting point for the inhabitants of the senior right to dwell but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has already been adopted by the provision of funds for the current budget in the past autumn, will be reimbursed by the possibility of funding.
The building is located in the cleaning area.
The establishment of a Community area, according to Tjaden, would be eligible by 60 percent of 30 percent.
The decision proposal provides for the investor to signal that in this respect it is not intended to throw a knob between his legs, the finding that both Sattel - which is linked to the environment - as well as Pultdach - would be possible to reduce the trading height and make the construction more economically.
Not necessarily, Wilfried Sohmer does not just mean this addition.
If it helps, onestimmously he happens to the body.
It is not so easy for the Community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not get straight forward, now you reject from the window at the community room, she says, "I'm doing hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is essentially speaking for the Community area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It looks behind a covered subsidie to anyway assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, for the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but it is a real, in doubt, marketable counterfeit.
Staiger's request to split the decision proposal accordingly finds three advocates.
Thus it remains at two contradictions in the original programme which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision so, we take a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Wheeler is thrown on the road
When crossing the street, a 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car in Garath on Wednesday and was severely injured.
As the police told, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the way to Hilden with his bicycle on the road of the Black road.
The senior wanted to cross the highway in the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
However, when the Langenfelder went to the street, he apparently did not pay attention to counter traffic.
He stood with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern München has to abstain from David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game sauce against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund to the first duty game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defendant at the supercup against the pocal winner.
Personal care at the German football record champion Bayern München is growing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also abstain from David Alaba in the Duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the monniks Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
She wasn't good at last."
But the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my crew shows these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "though, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights draws fans into their ban.
The party was sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German football Liga (DFL) informed on Friday.
Wander in the harce from star to star
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created in the boundary.
This plants St. Andreasberg, the United Nations Observatory.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information by many hard visitors, said it.
He connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "good-accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper heart.
The question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is intended to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended to train.
"On the star path, the viewers experience much knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
They also learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, although it is farther away.
It is also provided in which star image is a chosen star and when it is best to see.
The association has already operated in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest location of the northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Natural Protection.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly seen with the only eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Planetary Association, there has been something similar to the planned star railway - the planetary road.
Starting before Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet path leads up to the hainberg and the star watch – as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (Community Likes) with the planet Sedna.
The stables with the individual planets - including the degraded pluto at the end point - are exactly set in distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter, while the exact 75 metres away sun still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is about four kilometres.
While the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the pluto, pedestrians need a good hour up to the steam with Pluto.
So walkers are faster than the light in the universe.
The march to the next fast star, but it would last half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lo maakko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be at a collisions course to take the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbracked World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the walk to welcome Lo maakko to the World Boxing Organisation Super-Feder Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pounds list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you luck."
Lo maakko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 p.m. to ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis noticed climate that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a former feather weight," said Garcia.
"I rose up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I am not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to lightweight.
And he must move on lightweighter [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give it to them."
Lo maakko agreed.
"Boxen needs this fight."
The climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lo maakko has to fight with a 135-pounds debt this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after its lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked for him," said Garcia, and later expressed openly to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can produce this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lo maakko as "a huge fighter", and he may be participating in his Saturday campaign.
But Lo maakko kept on with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks he sees the three-fighting champion from Riverside "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said the focus was to show stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the moment that was built up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lo maakko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tyres
In the event of an accident on the A7, four persons were partially severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control over his vehicle at 16.30 p.m. just before the connector Marketbreet after a tyre square.
The truck swooped right into the bowl, where he swooped and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were sometimes severely injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured ones by the rescue service, the A7 was locked north for about an hour, and then the traffic could be transmitted on the left drive to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann, after the 2:2 seasonal recording against Braunschweig, hopes that optimization of the defence formation will bring points in Aue.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, with the result, wouldn't the two counterports have been at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"There were two counter gates too much, and we need to be better watchful in Aue," says the defendant of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
It is also intended to further optimize the threeer chain in the erd mountain.
And a gate after a fire, the fortunes do not want to catch themselves.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will be better managed after the experiences in preparing the threeer chain than with the fourer chain.
"Now I don't know how we're going to act in Aue," said his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann's business is safe, "because we're just in the threeer chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"There is a prerequisite, but that we are even better harmonized and we do not make so many play errors in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also rides to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can talk about a misleaded start after a distinct, you don't know.
The performance could be all right," said Hoffmann.
"If we are standing on Sunday with four points and can focus on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal record."
His trainer didn't want to know about that.
"The start in the season I only turn after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to talk about a advantage to Aue, just because the game of the Saxony in Heidenheim had to be interrupted in advance because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they are currently," says the internal defense of Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rheinland are going to the meeting in the final (fast) stage of Aue as a small favorite on Sunday.
"That we take them away, just because we have the right to come under the first six, it's crazy," says Funkel, whose balance is positive in just one decline against nine games.
"There is no crew in the Second Federal League that you have to beat from before," explains Fortunas Chief Coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and superior."
And that's how Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new medical assessment method of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedical Institute) has started to carry out tests last year.
They are to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority (Migration Agency) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less aged.
To date, the Forensic Medicine Agency has sent 6.880 cases to be tested and has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March until 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in 25 other cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson by the Forensic Medicines Agency, the results are constant during the past months.
"We see no major difference in statistics in the past months, the figures are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases of "the suggestions that the investigated person is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that it became 18 years of age this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings are made of scientists and MRT records by knees, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologs, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans, to see whether they went through the pubertät before or later as usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the type of measurement should be used.
Assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we should not do as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of wrong assessment of a child as a adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is less than 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday a seven tons heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, construction director at the Department of Strasbourg and Transport in the Government Bureau Freiburg.
In April the work began at the same time on all three resettlement bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is intended for October and is easy to ensure that the schedule is followed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wavebow bridge of concrete, dressed with red buntsand stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and transport safety, the three constructions are now being thoroughly resettled.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red buntsand stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap on Wednesday morning on the north side.
This is a margin mounting that is also used as a operational route.
The southern part of the bridge is intended to use a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap on Friday.
Then the footway is to go.
The special thing is that it is complete parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special finger tip feeling has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The inhabitants were informed about the project in the preliminary field of the work by handbooks.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Building building and the Sammelweier towards Schramberg, the traffic is spectacularly regulated by an ampel.
For the construction work at the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseineineingang, the road in the area of the bridge is fully locked at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The cost of the three bridge improvements totally amounts to EUR 700 000.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It is not so frequent that parties are dragging on a strange, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it is very difficult to put it under a hat.
The parties represented on the day of the volcano (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, left) are part of a wide alliance that shows peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD invites Rondell to the poster "Große Wahlkampfauftakt" in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle.
And familiar names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the federal day election on September 24, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the beginning of the event in place do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but demonstrate.
The motto "The egg remains bright."
Originally, the city-picknick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place at the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the most important organisers, is really happy: "Tell, how many people have gathered here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "urdish potato salad that the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, she shows presence mainly at the railway station, which is only a few meters away from the places of events.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulcan Islands reports that he has tried to find such an event and get the suggestion.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes, there were not enough parking places.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
In view of the event at the Rondell premise, he says: "This is the good right of people, main cause, it remains peaceful."
It also does: at 20 p.m. at the Rondell premises a band provides entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfalz-AfD-Präsident Uwe Junge.
There are about 200 listeners in the hall who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestagwahl, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
Something more than an hour will take the AfD event, the guests on the premise have a longer breath, but also there is required to clean up shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can back off - no special events.
Posaune meets Trompet
A hearing with Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 a.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trompet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets on Black Forest", or also "Balcanfolklore" meets a classic German training with roots in blasmic.
Both solists are winners and prizemakers of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
Thus, Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned concert building Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the various genres.
So Johann Sebastian Bach is associating with the two as in a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of Jazzecho prizemaker Nils Wogram, mixing classics, Jazz and the free plays into a fascinating whole artwork.
This core part of the programme was not taken up until this spring with a huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything out," said Kristen Stewart very openly about her bisexuality.
"If I bite in grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?"
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood Star was Robert Pattinson, who finally became bitterly distinguished with her "Twilight" collar.
Despite all this, the brown actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was really in love with anyone I dated.
Or do you think I had played it?"
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed seriously in it.
So it's never confused or disabled me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously."
Especially below, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she was rather dressed like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bubble.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back, and I think, 'Well, be proud of you.'
Especially to the public, they do not like to explain their love life: "The people expect you to act in a certain way and that irritates me.
And perhaps some call me unthankful, but I do not like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces that he is switching the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the party at a Thursday night with President Trump.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as an inhabitant of West Virginia, I can't help you any more if I'm a democratic governor."
The advertising broke out in joy.
"I'll change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he has coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said: "The party change of Governor Justice is another struggle for a democratic party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governances and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership and is unable to find a positive, agreed message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "fair" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world boss of light athletes, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday, which he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport.
Russia's light athlete cemetery Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF convention on the evening of the Light Athlete World Championships that the exclusion of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight baptism.
He said that he was sorry for "all the athletes who were kidnapped in competition gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Convention voted for maintaining the prohibition that was imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-promoted doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole convention were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reformed."
Coe said he was also "rejoicing" that Russia accepts the criteria for its re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to restart Russia," said Coe.
"We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral actors in the light athlete world championships that begin on Friday in London according to the strict IAAF criteria.
On Monday, the head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reconstitution.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Traurage act for crashed soldiers in Mali
At a grief celebration in the Nordhesian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers who died in Mali had thought of a helicopter crash.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in Domstadt under high security arrangements.
The defence minister Ursula said nothing about Leyen (CDU).
She called the two pilots who died, however, "the teachers of her expertise".
"We adhere to this highest victim they offered in behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of North Hessen had died in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their sarges were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a death guard of the Federal Army to the Fritzlar Dom St. Peter.
In the afternoon, only the members of the church took their dismissal.
Then the grief celebration began in the family circle, close friends, representatives of the federal army and politics.
Hessens Minister President Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Federal Defense Volker Wieker were among them.
The sad guests laid roses, the relatives stood in arms to the sairs.
Before the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence minister of the Leyen called the soldiers who died as "high decorated" and decorated.
The Chief of Stabs had built the flight operation of the Tiger Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regime.
Also Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, among which the soldiers belonged, said: "If this crew could not turn away the crash, no one would have been able to."
No doubt about the UN mission in Mali, the Leyen minister did not show that the operation was dangerous.
But he is also of great importance "for a country that we are only separated from by two states," she said.
After the grief celebration, the saists were brought out of the court.
When and where they are reimbursed, the federal defense did not make any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be placed next to his wife after his death.
The king's house was informed on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish monarch is accompanied in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophage for the two.
The queen agreed with the decision of her husband, continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be unclear.
But he does not intend to be assisted in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hole of the fact that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the throne climbing his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to be king.
In 2016 he retired and also issued the title "Prince fair".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not have the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the Chief Speaker of the Danish Royal House, explained.
Where the last place of the 83-year-old will be finally, be unclear.
However, he does not intend to be assisted in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French noble sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Themse in the French embassy.
While his later wife always fled to the people's sympathy proclamations, Prince Henrik had a severe position in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swinging, I prefered wine instead of beer, silk cumshots instead of stripsocks, citrons instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia Tabak and those in this country had the reputation to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for consideration.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
It was like two mistakes!"
Minister President Weil wants to re-evaluate rapidly
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Niedersachsen
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is resigned after the loss of the red-green majority of governments for a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
That is why, on Friday, Parliament's resolution was resolved.
Previously, the surprising excursion of a Green Group from their country-day fraction in Niedersachsen had crashed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country day election, the red-green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scarce one-stimme majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green-Department Elke Twesten founded its step with non-nomination for the election 2018 in its electoral circle in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU-Fraction Manager Björn Thümler is trying to recommend his group to take it.
In this way, CDU and FDP have 69 seats together in the Dutch country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new country day will be regularly selected on 14 January next year.
Thumler said that the red-green country government now needs to decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil considers it essential, however, that the land day decides as quickly as possible its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further approach on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day withdraws confidence from the Prime Minister and chooses a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally purely tested," said Thumler.
"You will be able to discuss all questions in peace when they are reasonably examined."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but something curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She referred to herself as an attendant of Black Green.
The Greens urged the apostate Members to return their country day mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she returns her country day mandate, which she has received over the green country list, with immediate effect," informed Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner national chairmen.
The Group Chairman of Green Anja Piel said, "We regret the decision of Every Twesten extremely."
It has deliberately decided not to have a debate in the Group.
"Even in the background that there were no content differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD-Cancel candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Dutch Green Departments Every Twesten to CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green Groups in Niedersachsen is not only betrayal to the voters but also to the Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country day.
The Twest's exit costs red-green in Niedersachsen the majority.
The politician puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country "in her injured negligence and in her frustration," criticized the SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU joins this dirty intrigent game in Niedersachsen and attempts to strike political capital from it."
Niedersachsen's CDU Group Head Björn Thümler recommends his members to include every Twesten in the CDU.
The group head of the SPD on the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, invited Twesten to mislead the result of the 2013 country day election with personal career.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and Greens had a shock thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Minister for Agriculture at the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses polluted eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) interviews the editorial Network Germany (RND) talk and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.foodwarning.de, the Federal States provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned.
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, after everything we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the teacher is not really understood by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the federal countries.
Yet, my house has come up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the fact that Germany is concerned.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
Trade has to ensure, as producers, that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If the maximum residue content of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded, these are not transportable.
However, unbelasted eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, the companies are not guilty.
Sitting production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, production companies do not commit direct debt.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage because of presumably illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the serious case.
Is there only a lack of personnel or also of decisive competence?
It was just the official controls that discovered the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded up to 100 percent.
This is why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors is crucial in cases where crimes may occur.
I have already repeatedly made it clear that I expect an unhappy information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food sector, consumers are rightly disturbed.
This means that manufacturers, traders and consumers have been encountered in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the holding of food suppliers is not acceptable and must be discontinued immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be clarified quickly and indefinitely.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football associations will not disturb Neymar's World Record Transfers from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint Germain.
Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the leading organization, which monitors the European game, has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions-League tournier.
Financial Fair-Play rules that were launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must sometime prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can surely ease the money so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must counter taxes with legitimate sources of revenue, allowing them to Break-Even point in their business related to football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his choice as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively deceived and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, the FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea – purchased a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the crew and to build a global brand – should become a harder issue.
During the current three-year FFP deposit period which runs by 2018, clubs can increase losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen by the Presidentship in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA follower Alexander Ceferin continues to work on reducing excessive expenses.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a fixed clause, it can distribute the amount for the accounting of the duration of its contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the sum of deposits for the next five years can be declared at EUR 44.4 million in the annual account.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a money penalty of 60 million euros (this time 82 million dollars) which was subsequently reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overliste their financial supervision by raising their revenues by companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a catarical company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was exhausted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar on payments from the WM 2022 organisational committee.
But PSG and Katar 2022 argued that Neymar will become WM messengers and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.
The previous penalties against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more aware of any attempt to avoid the rules.
The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 has gained over EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will rise by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish Liga was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would injure the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS regarding the last property of Katars to PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is in possession of an American sports physician, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a association, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to respect the financial fairy because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the collaboration is at a possible end: the airline recalls the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, on request, the news agency sda confirmed a corresponding report from the Friday newspaper "Nordwest Switzerland".
Due to current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and undergone quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current Supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red white packed shoggi tables distribute the flight companions to passengers to 14 grams a year before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs.
Industry insider estimates the volume of orders by "Nordwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughters achieve an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious job for a shoggi manufacturer.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolate Frey is trying to renew the Treaty beyond spring 2018.
The largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolate Frey.
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the First Class are confused with decoratives from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class naked passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Shoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi is also distributed by Chocolate Frey, both in business and in Economy Class.
Light athlete - Discus-Olympiatic Robert Harting reached WM-Finale
The three-time world champion fights in the final on Saturday for a medal.
His brother Christoph, Olympian of 2016, failed in the national WM excretion and was able to look at the discus competition only from the Tribüne.
Similarly, with the first attempt, the Polish title defendant Piotr Malachowski, who was thrown 65,13 meters, qualified for the end fight.
Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the nisch
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s, for the 90-year-old grunge era (which the predenkers David Wain and Michael Showages turned the Sketch-Comedie "The State" for MTV) and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is likewise a parodie and a formation of our Facebook-able era of permanent memories.
But as Franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking on the core of the Gag - actors of middle age play great children who grow up - they nevertheless made it impossible to recover the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more according to the Gießkannprincipe, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that Shocks the Way").
On one point a character stood by an Apple Powerbook, some inline cats and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showage), now Roman author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity yet.
And there is another crazy-evil-like plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-populated impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, excursions are the best part of the Franchise.
It's especially fun to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd that Matt Dillon's sublipable to "Singles" shows, whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
It is the moments of random crazy that could hesitate this Franchise like a type of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds us of another type of nostalgia: the reliving of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-in-West Ringkampf iconography.
The comodie created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighth years with the two police as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism leninism.
The main roles - a hard-sotted Gregor and an idealist iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an exporting producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to view (the police spend the time watching chess on television, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides for a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so engaged in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer carrying a Reagan mask - that it often plays as one.
In six long episodes it moves, and the comodie is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a lower length, could deliver his Agitprop satire better, since Gregor and Iosef visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that western culture can make everything to feed for a position.
The fictional Romanian Creators were not wrong: We do it even with our own younger history and with its own.
Fight against drug mafia in the country
The police have managed a battle against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Bar circuit, in Rottweil, constanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as state lawyer informed Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused persons between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and already adopted arrest orders against them.
In addition, the officials provided larger amounts of marihuana and cocaine, shooting weapons and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in the case of contemporary races in Italy.
There were German arrest orders against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
Over 300 cops were in operation.
The members of Mafia are imposed on organised drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, and abuse and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the prosecution has established constanz against the organised drug trade in the southern German area.
Between the state prosecutors in constanz and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the detectives of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the major effort was also accompanied by four Palermo officials.
In the vision of the investigations, Italian nationals with close reference to Italian mafia drew mainly.
Also an incident on 27 May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a guest place early in the morning, should go to the account of the bands.
How to complain about large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany shows considerable deficiencies.
This leads to some serious failures in asylum procedures.
The representative of the Federal Government's Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen, has, according to a media report, made attention to large gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partially serious failures" in asylum procedures and discharges, warned in an analysis of the South German newspaper.
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 have been found "of people who are long out of life, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
"Erroneous data can significantly slow back processes," the report continues.
In the statistics on departure persons, EU citizens are also included, which do not have to travel out at all.
Such false associations, however, led "to a distorted debate on dealing with the departure obligations", is said in the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government apparently started sending refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they traveled in there.
This comes from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
In the paper it says that BAMF has carried out such procedures "with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - back to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, as the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the site.
Following the Dublin Agreement, it is responsible for refugees in the EU State, which they first reach.
If an migrant moves forward to another EU country, this State can return it to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity of reception for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably."
Italy has issued guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (ECMR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Convention.
The speaker of the left-hand fraction, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Familys with children are threatening because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights infringement conditions and a danger of child welfare."
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from persons living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service to other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who now shared 100 donations 50 litres of blood.
Traditionally, the community at the meeting of the municipality deserves the multiple willingness to give blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it, and we give respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers still inappropriate," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservations are destroyed in their components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"In this year, with 114 donors we achieved the second best result," said the DRK circuit leader.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umber were multitude donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter spent ten times every 500 milliliter of their life juice.
The Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the reduction of inflation have reduced speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "contracts" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Monetary Committee's political decision-makers (MPC) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase in this month, as the weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue, where inflation is expected to rise to nearly 3 % in the autumn.
But she signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary in order to boost the inflation heated by Brexit, and she said that the loan costs might have to increase more than expected to the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the Mammut conjuncture package that was released a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide more cheap funding for banks from February onwards, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (BIP) remains short-termly weak, since pressure on real income of households continues to burden consumption."
On the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain punishment of monetary policy" would be necessary for cooling inflation and a "a little greater" scale than the markets are expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "declining" and "restricted".
The Bank's downward growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecasts in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pounds fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pounds fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the latest disappointing growth rates have reduced the rising expectations for an increase in interest and GDP has increased from 0.2% in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and low wage increases, since the worsening of the households is getting worse first before it gets better.
She added that in the next few years money policy cannot 'prevent income breaking' but added that wages will be recovered "definitely" at the end of their three-year pronunciation.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pounds, which will compensate for part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% in August, after the shocking EU vote caused the reduction of the pounds.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last sentence on interest rates, the call had increased after an increase in interest, as inflation increased pressure on hard-tressed households and three political decision-makers demanded a rise of 0.5% in July.
Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will be dressed again in the next few months.
The Bank said that the crossover in relation to its objective of 2 % is "to be all" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline of the swap rates, the hypothesis market is expected to become more competitive, since the creditors want to search for business and end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those with the existing deals and terminates the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates become more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is supposed to prescribe controversial HIV threats 10,000 people
Patients will be received from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS access to a "transformative" HIV-preventive treatment.
NHS England announced that a preexposition pre-exposure prophylaxe (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of high-risk patients with approximately 86 percent, is now delivered by healthcare services over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the appeal court had confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first that will allow the registration of people, and other clinics will be followed in October before it will be introduced in whole England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious hazards.
Taking PrEP before sex means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Among those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an internationally competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is targeted, recorded and implemented in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is aimed at needy and at risk, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister of Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changed infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to get a step closer to the end of the distribution of HIV in society'.
The great life: Interior floor and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Earl's Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of a elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets.
"For that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me in Earl's Court, and she had the same high ceiling.
I loved her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overwhelmed.
Originally a one-room property with a shaken layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne to add a space and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally.
"I wanted high ceiling, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceiling and create a home that was not only a development but also a place of life for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the standard.
"The steel work is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to buckle.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but to install the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled the Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamourous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting sets the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is reflected to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer room for all the covers and glasses of Joanne.
Through perception of a glamourous room, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapsable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the stealing, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you move the door up, it's very easy to glitter."
Thanks to the clever use of space and space, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"On the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate maker will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the soil area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't in love with the electric boxes in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters from something standard to something very amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in a dispute because of one of Victoria’s largest real estate realms worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its business resources are to be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a thorough distinction about separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties in value of more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the corporate capabilities and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property at the value of $316 million and Paul at the value of $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failures.
The brothers are now fighting to control the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but he suggests Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicates from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jean shop of the family.
Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share her property with their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis business group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million when the company left.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation."
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to accuse me and drag our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and me to end in our current struggle," he said, adding that he "everytime hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new head of staff plans to limit the president's media absence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of Staff of the White House intends to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Stab Manager of the White House, met with leaders on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tighten Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is back for decades - and now where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Kandidat Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting from bodies that were to be convinced," said former electoral advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to control Trumps Twitter habits is, according to six former electoral officers, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officers know something we don't know - that Trumps Tweets had contained more fuel without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble several times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one could consistently prevent Trump from causing controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
In May, politico, which was fully concerned with this history, reported the preference of the consultants to provide the President with doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he finds out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously accused the President of a printed copy of a article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-president Chief Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Schikanes, or that he did not offer concrete evidence, or that he had in the past made false accusations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the former Stabschef Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "twod to implement a system to manage and document the paper crush received by the Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the people are asked and hoped to help them.
Police all over Europe sends this summer (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the escape.
Since the addresses of the searched criminals are naturally not known, the people are hoped and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experiences had shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postcards were compiled for searched criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times have been viewed.
36 of the online searches have been arrested until now, at least 11 of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'millionary' series
Some of the richest houseowners of the West Midlands are again standing on the foot of war with some decisive travelers who have negotiated a grave drawn from the municipality to demand a field in front of their master houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 cars on a field outside a wealthy road from Solihull, called the "millionary line".
They brought horses, babies and a army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being scared off by a grave buried by the Council to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained disabled to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have pushed the Solihull Council, who said it was "needless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones to the passages.
The Council has to be forced by shame to implement because it has been useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived yesterday evening, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop this."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the streetsbrook Road and work together with the police of Solihulls. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many inhabitants as possible report a anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
Birkenhof becomes forest hotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the forest hotel Luise becomes.
The house before the gates of Freudenstadt is currently renovated and is to be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the ambient company mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 stays per year were lost and also revenues by the Kurtaxe were lost.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation to the Land Council in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees coming into the countryside, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum candidates by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not contested in the municipality at that time.
However, most of all, the chief mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of serious stakeholders at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with headquarters Birgit Scherer with a seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star pllus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the pleasant town object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Park Hotel Luise and now forest hotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing for a long time in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it is clear how extensive renovation work is done.
The floors were cut out, ceiling partly, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is a single building site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large entrance showers, the entrance area is converted, new windows are built up.
Everything was to be "beautiful bourgernah" later, as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
"We want to make a jewel out there."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.
You do not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated city-level, stressed Scherer.
The forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to stand wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidays, groups or businessmen should feel well at the hotel.
Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause he has already conducted, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city are the same as those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Ask for the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself exactly.
Nearly under one million euros, he counts.
The outdoor installations are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russian affair: U.S. Special Officers employed Grand Jury
In the Russian affair of US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller said he used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The body has taken the job over the past few weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote up people familiar with the case.
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported that there are already first invitations from the body in connection with a meeting between Trumps' oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. Secret Services accuse the Kremlin for a long time to have intervened targetedly in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's Champ and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is to be on several men who acted in the election campaign as representatives of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special detective Trump personally moved to the center and examined the claim that the President might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible crime cases and decide whether to accuse.
Grand jurys are therefore also called charges chambers.
They are usually turned on if it is larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board may also be employed by the prosecutor in order to invite persons to be consulted under an oath.
According to the transmitter CNN, premiums have already been issued for the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons participating in the meeting had been invited to make a statement, the report stated.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then champion Paul Manafort were in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US TV that the establishment shows that Mueller is not being scared in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would be turned on at the end to decide on the accusation.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the middle of the new discoveries, the President used a talk in West Virginia on Thursday night to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives democratics an opportunity to "feel well because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he didn't know about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But they usually work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House supports any action that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI CEO James Comey said three times that the president wouldn't be detected.
There is no reason to assume that something has changed it, it continued in the statement.
But Mueller had been used only after Trump Comey had fired.
Because of this outcast, accusations against Trump had become high, he wanted to impair justice.
Comey said before a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure for the investigation.
Following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his employees.
The resulted in speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair about the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the need of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republic and democratic senators presented on Thursday legislative drafts, which the special detectors could not be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg travels in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a giant iceberg has dissolved from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the shelfeis.
This was an informed by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday.
The over a billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of Kolossai is now moving north and will probably need two or three years until it has been merged.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice gigants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not go out of him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear to research.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual breakdowns of ice creams in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to the heating of the earth.
The now broken colossal has been part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.
Shelfish swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
Thus it grows increasingly into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula south of South America.
North of this shake was the balance of growth and abortion disrupted a few years ago.
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes that a total shawl has fallen down there.
There are some things to say that the Larsen-C shilling feast is also in danger, because the front side has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and may fall down if a piece is interrupted at a key point.
The melting of shake and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and ice presses as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shawl leads to the glaciers to melting directly into the sea and flowing far faster than before.
This may increase the sea level, but only in a small amount, the British research project writes to observe Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is, according to AWI data, the fourth largest seal of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front side to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Though it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
In controversy among scientists, whether the Larsen-C-schelfee is going to grow again or go back long-term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last decades.
Although these researchers do not reflect the breakdown of this giant iceberg on climate change, very many ice creams of the Antarctic peninsula have fallen down over the past decades.
This long peak of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the island of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and is one of the most rapid areas in which the temperature rises.
CDU wants home tariff at staff
Since it is increasingly difficult to occupie freecoming jobs, the CDU calls on the employer association to get more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the circuit day has made 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now again, 17 trainers have their first day of work behind themselves.
The teaching places in the circle seem to be very desired.
About 620 applications were recorded for the places to be confided this year.
However, the circuit lacks further staff to meet increased requirements and tasks.
There are still 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann Circle.
They are searched for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG on the circular day and to face the lack of expertise in administration.
On the request of the parties, the management is intended to "develop a concept of employment and development of staff".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract future-oriented the lack of applicants, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inside and outwards, showing concrete measures for cross-border increases and includes a training offensive, demanding CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that were not known earlier.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a regular "competition of public employers".
This includes a high number of employees who exclude sickness or age-related from the service.
Thus, the maximum time to act so that no more jobs are unemployed.
However, Klaus-Dieter peoples, Head of the CDU Group, continue to go beyond the common application with his party.
He recently provided a thick surprise on the circuit day when he questioned the expenses of staff publicly and he blurred the other parties.
People want to check all possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer association.
"If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the circuit management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a home tariff," states people.
In this way, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff arrangements.
The wages are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circuit have grown increasingly in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees care for the provisions of the new prostitution law.
Not least through the rising number of asylum candidates, Landrat Thomas Hendele and circuit director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy intensifys the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs, using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turiner daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had enclosed a boat from the German Young Restoration Organisation because their team had effectively cooperated with human merchants in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The auxiliary organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself on detailed accusations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and the salvation of human life remains our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have watched the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes hose-boat migrants on board, which are delivered directly by human merchants and that the butchers can ride off so that the ships can be used again.
At least one of these meetings was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Lebanese coast, according to the Act of the State Advocate whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to overlook the authority of the Italian coastal guard, rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Behaviour, boats such as the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have yet to be prepared to follow the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with their rescue actions "a substantial changes or disabilities".
Among those who refuse to sign, the nobel prize carrier organisation is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti said now that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in the last few weeks had declined drasticly, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperation with local mayors have brought fruit.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan Mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in the guardhouse in the North Pfalz to enjoy trials and attractions for four days.
Three friends were available for this.
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michael Kapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, of which one could look far above the pfalzer forest and the pre-lagered levels.
Between then, there were increasing increases that were rewarded by long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Folksfest Wurst Market.
The viewpoint reappeared to the viewpoint, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
During the last two days, there were again many height meters.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and entrance caves brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikes attracted sole healing in the free air inhalatorium.
Newstadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 height meters, the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for E-Sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium races?
Fact is: E-Sport has long been a serious sector, become a lucrative business - large stars, million fans and huge tournaments with high gagen inclusive.
This has also been recognized by the first Federal Leagues who are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart, which started an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope thereby to enthusiasm to new young target groups for the VfB," says the Board of Directors Jochen Rotgermann.
He's sure, "that still rises on this train a number of associations."
On the next weekend the FIFA World Association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of various clubs join each other.
For example, along with Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the E-port.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen advises a virtual football player agency now.
"The real football must be discussed with the 14-30-year-olds in particular that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent e-porters under contract, you could be more often present online on these markets than to send the Federal League to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it?
Computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counderline" or just the football simulation FIFA are being fought at competition level.
At the longest, as in normal sports, ligates have established, where the professionals are arriving against each other.
And in the Asian games of 2022, E-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it anyway a real sport?
For many, the idea is safely used.
Ingo Frobose has also been discussing the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classic sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactionability.
Professional Gamer should train not only at the console, but also their body and take care of the diet.
"The fitte player is a good player."
But Frobose also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic."
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.
Positively, the scientists highlight the high level of integration of the E-port.
The players are traveling internationally, this is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of the Business Advisory Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly about advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, sales is supposed to be 130 million.
It is little to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Soccer League.
However, the e-port "was not far away from the other established sports types such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," writes the Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are already going on internationally.
Great markets are Asia and the USA where ex-baseball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invested in the eSport competition unicrn.
Some things are doing in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a school, says Frobose.
In the Netherlands and France, the Football Firstliga Associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an E-port department.
"In the European comparison Germany is behind," explains the VfB Board of Directors Rottgermann.
Just falling in nostalgia and clarifying old times is no longer enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time orienting the company into the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"There can't be said that only at football everything remains as it was always."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
From the scandal of poisonous eggs are now affected almost all the federal countries.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and took all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are proven to contain no fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind grids and five years have been suspended.
Carter was condemned in June for the sudden murder of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is untreasurable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until calling.
She had been confronted with a 20-year high penalty, but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr. Roy were suffering from a psychic disease.
In red pants and a cream colored flower, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with traped hands and downward eyes when it was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She has not proved repentance."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "frightful situation that she totally regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that her age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant influence on their actions.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there's no day where I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains we will wear with us forever," says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she'd be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be aunt for his children.
"Not more to have this one person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precaution, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case took national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"High up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced for murder in 2007 to her British fellow inhabitant in Italy before she was released two years ago, was among the few who defended Carter.
Mrs Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Micelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lamb of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup best of a large season - extra-Motivation does not hurt there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the additional clothing was very, very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm or Manuel Newer were to be seen, he made himself the bond assigned to him hold on his arm.
"The trainer has not announced it," said the Confed-Cup-winner afterwards, after his first operation as Bayern captain.
Well, the objection could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naple.
But the sign of the coach was able to interpret the same way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been elected in the professional C-Elf, who was just come from the vacation, as a leader, but he.
Suckerl is best distributed to those who you trust much that you want to keep quiet.
So who has chosen to enter into the heritage of lamb can use a small extra-movement only well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old, as a mini lamb, flipped over the field.
Right behind, this is now his position, the white band on her arm did the other.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this starting formation like the one who can best take the rod in hand.
He gave instructions, trying to lead the uninflicted troop.
He had the look for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overwhelm his lack of fitness (has hardly worked); Renato Sanches to connect to the devils to the performances of the Asian trip (also worked conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not notice negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Tricot.
It worked very well anyway.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The well-occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and also attempted sulphur a few times in the game construction.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped it".
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.
Game shifting, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up."
How unusual this Bayern world is for the new access, it was seen after the party.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed after a few knocky statements in the back of his new companions.
There he heard of Süle a interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Damen
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB-Damen
Austria's most famous footballer has reported himself on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB's dam everything good.
The Bayern Legionary is a quisi club colleague of ÖFB Capitän Schnaderbeck and febert with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions-League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
The famous Bayern Dusel may also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rheinland-Pfalz Minister: Economy praises Wissings Speed
It was often inconsistent, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is shown after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs is in the office of Volker Wissing (FDP).
Chambers and companies from the region speak on TV demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Company (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The largest turn sees Natus in infrastructure policy: The closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process, which is intended to stand by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the western circuit of Trier, which is in the demand of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to run the route in December 2020, says Ministerial Speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Trade Chamber (IHK) Trier, as Wissing suggests, is seeking a Rheinland-Pfalz-Label in wine to increase the sale in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been dropping for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the IHK praises.
The crafts chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainers in the new Master Bonus, says manager Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 is provided for the master review and EUR 2500 if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of master training.
The home job list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, it is quickly to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, the main business leader of the IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to stop Wissing in the country operation mobility, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to external offices.
CDU-Fractionsvize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less in the conservation of country roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the lack of professionals in the region.
It is also the country's wideband expansion that has been achieved.
In 2016, regional companies had only evaluated the network supply in an IHK survey with note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
On the other hand, former Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months because of disagreements.
Audi is intended to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a counter-reaction
One day before announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" and refers to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is resident - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would change three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback.
European automobile manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emitte diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs for the car manufacturers to install installations for neutralisation of the exhaust gas emitted by diesel vehicles also increase, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of restraining the powerful car companies and ignoreing the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagens that were able to regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices to comply with the rules when a car was tested but re-run at normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of Volkswagens, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put before court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagens after the authorities accused Audi to have a system installed to avoid emissions rules in Europe, and an application that focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to burden Volkswagens: The luxury car manufacturer contributes excessively to the winning of Volkswagens.
This message has the river on Saturday on Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to include the Isar visitors, a river passing through Munich on the morning, which has a special message.

Unless the Baureferat wants to clarify.
On the river you can see a big information transparent.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The commencement to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.

Mordillo's nose and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon drawings, the knobnas of his figures are his brand.
At 85 the Argentine also draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he struck himself as a signator for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my Professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he managed the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artists of cities are constantly inspiring.
Large, round Mordillo figures are in drawings with Pisa's shirt tower, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still sitting on the drawing table, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for gross and small, T-shirts, plumbers and watchs, its delicious figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillos' most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-fisher as a counterplayer.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film that will come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The turnbook is not written by him.
That is why he places more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without wortlessness.
Lavendel from Provence threatens climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in Southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is decline due to the conditions of dryness and insects transmitting from diseases, which creates great headaches for scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This affects the life of Lavendel.
There is also a small cikade, a microbacteria that transmitts dwarf zicade, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavendel oil is not only attracting for holidays, it is also very demanded for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts of etheric oil."
The solutions considered include a better water distribution and slowing down the dilution from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of species that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thüringian Rhine celebrates his 1200-year-old existence.
The high point is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creamers, teeth, merchants, vagants or a national servant camps are supposed to be experienced in the city of the city in these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they gathered together to talk about security.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allied.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdomen feelings are sufficient.
There are drugs smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the government or the cartel's salary list, a catalogue of criminals that makes the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest break of violence, and while the bodies are raising throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589 stands after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there are at least seven dead in seven states in this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the fassade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, Paranoia.
Although a special federal lawyer was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organised crimes each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely put before court.
At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrustful and even though the terrain is more traitful now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
In fact, rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that any person or more people are shot every day in Sinaloa on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-stage Mouseoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
For one minute, forget that there is a state of "susence" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traffic routes in the United States.
Yet, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was crushed with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalising cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have irritated the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the enclosure of another newspaper, which had published the same history.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as a experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish thorough investigations without fear of censur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drugs trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the task that will happen to you as a journalist - either this or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in view of so many dead people ... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fluke like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death also forced her to question their own assumptions on how they can do their work best and keep them alive.
"You don't like it if you work with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start-up and landing tracks" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-census and self-conservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The problem is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, "A sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - not as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a poisonous mixture of lucrative butterfly routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce's employees met for security training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-stage building in a middle-class quarter of Culiacan.
Half in joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself declared untrustworthy.
It's been months ago since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drug bands are de facto under control.
For the edition of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on the government expenditure focused on the capital of the governor.
And there was a group who carried out kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the government institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption because of high-care cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this room, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped military assault.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
Over the whole country, journalists have become more loud by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on roads and buildings.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and to let them kill because they said the truth.
She has since asked her to be reassigned by the government because she is worried that her anger has injured her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "omring" by organised crimes, government officials involved, and a non-favourable society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands, but also on order by politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organised crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut your mouth," said Ramirez.
Obviously, the murders have a terrifying effect.
No one forgets the death of the Blogger Mary Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note that was said to be signed by Zetas-Kartell: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to conclude, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Correspondent Miroslava Break in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a headline article on the title with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that the drug trafficking frightens him.
"Moxiko goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on Friday, when the last edition was already completed, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizen climb in front of the office and drank beer when at once all their phones began to sum.
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the bathing site of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens caught up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept the guard to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the falling founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"When Javier was murdered on the same day, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used tarnation to avoid their enemies
At first view, it looks like a statue, even a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible noshorn of a Canadian mineworker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his shaving skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of a "wrong past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" called it "the best-performed dinosaurs who have ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs of the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur, which lived in the middle of the creed period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-reserved condition has been blown by researchers who describe it as "remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the planted freezer is the best preserved fossil of its species.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grew on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more accurately.
Fossil found by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy pounds of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be disclosed.
"If you're just blitzing a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best-made dinosaur exemplares - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found out that this plant freezer, although covered with a gun and similar to a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat eating dinosaurs.
The strongly planned dinosaur used a red and white tarnation to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as a counter-shady, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to be better mixed into its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurian family made a first headline in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours deploying it carefully.
The amazing maintenance of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shoes and guns over his body.
They discovered the counter-shadowing, a widespread defence method in the animal empire, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the contant estimate is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur was chased of enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the degradation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals who use the contemporary estimation - think of rehe, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and harmfuler than prey, indicating that this nodosaurer was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Stark robbery behavior on a massive, strongly panished dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur robbers must have been in the creed time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for indications of his life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, the dinosaur came into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the sea ground.
At this time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further in the country than they are today.
"This nodosaurer is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early creed time.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you only shine a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he's sleeping."
The time of crying was a time when huge theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs, who were on two legs, were through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, some of his fearful ancestors hunted the paniced dinosaur.
This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was sank in the sea after death and mumified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grubed on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-powered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and gun, and is completely from the noise to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long peaks that went from his shoulders.
The scientists believe that the planted freezer was swimming through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.
But the subwater facilities of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The starved remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin residues still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is as rare as a win in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confused it becomes.
Stened remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that wear the animal's head.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are sprayed up.
I can count the shoes on his sohl.
In a shower: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, kilometers of staus and gaffers.
At the Stuttgart Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people have been injured at the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage.
According to the first information by the police, at 17.00 a.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg Country) connectors were almost 30 vehicles, including possibly trucks, together.
The exact number of injured persons was initially not reported.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A great deal of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked towards Munich.
In the direction of München, a ten kilometres long backstage was formed.
As a AZ reporter reports, there was also massive disabilities on the counterway - by numerous gaffers.
The fire force noted the marks of the vehicle lenders, which now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 a.m., a second accident occurred on the A8 this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue hub screw was on the way to the accident site.
German railway: Group tested "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone's ever experienced: nothing unusually you're sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
Comes the sheepfner and wakes you unsafe or screws the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
A driver's card control.
But the times of interruption are soon over.
The German railway is currently testing the unaffected driving card control.
You simply confirm by telephone that you take your place and thus discount the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two lines.
"If the offer comes, we'll expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many further distance routes in Germany at the beginning of the year," said a rail speaker.
"Comfort check-in" calls the railway the driving card devaluation without Schaffner.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what the most passengers do.
It must also be bought via the app of the railway which DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you rise in the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train accompanyer gets to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with a already declared online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which, in turn, is to use the passengers.
"Who wants to relax without ticket control through our train accompanying staff, simply checks in the DB Navigator himself.
This allows passengers to form their travel time in the train more personally," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Secondly, "And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs."
Who often drives railways knows that in addition to delays and missed trains, the driving card controls are among the biggest disturbances.
Because, in any case, one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to devaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personnel card is missing or a document you need to present.
The consequences are endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad atmosphere in the section or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the sheepfner at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that only on the ICE 915 connections Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart dinner.
Other train numbers on the same route have not yet been activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said there.
As nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retreated on their timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's area was the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live to two.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a sign with the record: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live-feed with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a bully dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman declared his gun and cried, "I'll kill you all animals."
"This is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've used to and which we can typically call."
At this moment I felt frozen.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two of them would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the topic of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the movies from 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, they discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition”.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activeism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to become free to deliver ourselves.
Even if I am lucky to give her an experience where she personally does not experience exaggerating racism, she is not different from the next black female child.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-account of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activity for Ferrell's design began to be accepted.
"My activity has changed completely after 9 August," she said and observed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all arrived."
Weeks later Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-regisseurs.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came in mind, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of humans, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-regisseur Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activity around death-tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other inhabitants followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us." Davis said.
"This was the main thing for me, how these people are presented, because this is how I will be rendered."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a Messianic leader, but a community that gathers together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open attendee of the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understood that there must be some injury in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of movement, who, after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "Blacklife Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really kept upright by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not a confirmative type of action", when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to its identity.
"She was the person who broke up this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, homosexual woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
In the meantime, the communication cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is at the expense for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.
It describes the social policy atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "A chaos."
Yet, she climbs to a song and feels obliged to remember this since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Traum" to "Great Wing": TV readers discuss Bit Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not yet built for a long time.
But since the first presentation in 2009, the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in supporters and opponents.
It's cold. It's hard to leave the topic one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While the one to the Bit Gallery says: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really classic" (Nicole shows), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi betzen) or simply: "Great whale!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates build on a gallery to move more customers into the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will blow out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the land where the farm market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will be terminated.
The Gallery Machers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and go to the Beda place with the opportunity to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying into the farm market hall for almost a week for many years.
Primarily our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwifes are always very much delighted.
We also discovered the Metzgerei for ourselves.
We would wish that, during and above all after the construction of the gallery, there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.
In other cities, there is too.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Of hiring direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery, it comes to the height of the rent.
However, it is not supposed to be low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I think it's excessive.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is so important that at least the market hall remains to us.
Because the product offered there is fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is price-valued above.
As you see, store shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not eligible for a retailer.
Damage, special businesses are almost no longer there and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm market hall to go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the last time the bit gallery would actually come.
Or does the spout Bit Gallery already make it possible to distribute all businesses from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not gonna work.
And a shopping center that's empty does not need anybody either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no more place.
When the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost insignificantly similar - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wangen tubes and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service Analytist banned a 35-year penalty after she made secretly classified diplomatic notifications about WikiLeaks websites.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 means A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmical analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data might look, sharpened, although some intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways, how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly speaking about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a corny, black-white selfish, in which Manning apparently sits on a driver seat and wears a platin-blown perücke - that she was associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from Forensian artefacts such as cigarette stump and rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.
This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and her prisoned museums became unequal letters friends who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would demand Mannings release only a few days after the book was published, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition now, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, two-temporary ways to unflamme the star divisions that he should actually repair.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with its overwhelming signature below (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of "automatic destruction, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondriale DNA sequence - a thousand footer of Cs and Gs and As, is written in lead pin.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by integrating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take from it is that our brain does not care for who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears from the United States' disciplinary career with a free-speaking phone, such as King-Kong.
"If they put your speech cold, they won," it says.
"So never shut your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greetes from Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting goose skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do so, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, which assembles like heroes of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 " 2 " Mannings statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunt is in progress for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who is searched for as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been injured with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder due to their claimed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the documents of the Court of Justice of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several steps.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event, and detectives investigate the steps as a murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor in microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now vacant and was excluded from joining the Campus of the Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A speaker of the university and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to resist the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the Building Manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, who said that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very horrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the event also took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published an explanation to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible home event."
"We will complete the WADA driving plan in the near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko
The Russian Vitaly Mutko vice-premier said it would not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) were implemented.
"In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA driving plan was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could give rise to concern for Russia.
"All things have been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping consultants must accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to claimed state-promoted dopings in Russian sports publicly.
As regards the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "We repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report without prejudice," said Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the WADA doping scandal.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
Following a visit from the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be re-used.
Aldi does not sell eggs first
This was noted by the corporate groups.
It was a pure precautionary measure, which could continue to be regarded as non-health disturbance, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-leasing agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often fuzzy, little helpful or, even worse, fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-Person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called out people for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee involvement, it enables companies to carry out surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allows to interact with the C-suite leaders and directly contact the Management Board.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for persecuting their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel won in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows on a view which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so that you can rebound, why.
Companies come to realize that the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you do not become the next Uber that was involved in scandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of disturbances where those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this wish for a overview is a lucrative business option.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion value in 2020, according to the financial-technical website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber Falls in discredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently logged in as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent companies let customized "puls-" surveys send, collect confidential answers in real time and look at the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that can report bad behavior with employees.
And if the main business manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats his employees badly or acts unethically, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer boykott, workers flexibility and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate centre.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate centre, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to persecute the complaints of employees.
Well, since the company uses Convercent, problems previously identified and addressed by leaders sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, leading the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Company began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen broke together for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took the time that the "Social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with returning fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Besemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only operations.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve profits when their portfolio companies are well running. Companies are well running when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the Analytics Tools promise third parties to increase commitment and use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee engagement by the experts of the workplace culture are important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or at all not, this can foster disappointment and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, the company who has seen too much relying on the collection of data.
"For if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care about it?
And who do you not care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and add a communication training to address the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this will lead to a better bond of workers in a industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose business.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes to 23 a.m. when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team at the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are inscribed for the summer courses will return to their final audits after the three-hour exercise before they return to Waterman Football Center on the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real tretmill for the boys the next three days," said the Bruins trainer Jim Mora just before Monday was on Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should begin at 19:15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playtimes in Westwood.
They are supposed to hold exercises in the course of August 18. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their incidence against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA rules change, even if they add a further point to the highly employed routes of players.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick on, they're great people.
I think, as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear visions of its fields, will not be a easy task for a nearby parking and the nearby Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been purchased with footballs that have cleared a protective net behind a gate.
Bruins players are supposed to occupie the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We're going to use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far from getting to think that people rent a room there and then sit there to record a exercise.
If you have the video tape of a exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We're gonna do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with error messages to third parties' fact auditors and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible error messages and to send them to fact verifiers which may show the results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, of which many believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where the French voters in the preliminary part of the presidency elections were flooded with false stories in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review will be started in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Besides the knowledge of the stories of fact-inspectors of third parties, people want to make more context to make solid decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the "related article" and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages.
Create a comic-Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaic Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I like to look at the manuscript of someone who has died for 300 years," he says sorely.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unforeseen emotionally.
"I have only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobines," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell for smoking, for at that time a fire was burned because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he would be there.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived nearly four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overestimated my greeting") all of this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenic heads on the walls and bottles that spent centuries in the graves.
He walked through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whisky and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the roof."
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who had something: "You might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a bear that fought the two families.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dip into the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's resurrection of 1381.
"There is a record of an upturn that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.
"The farmer resurrection began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe these two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patriarch, which the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the butcher Arthur Darrell is represented from the 18th century, who introduced his own funeral by filling a bag of stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his bag was buried out).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Favorite family of Scotney: "The men seemed to be pretty gay, always guilty and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise."
After the end of his operation in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic-Roman about Elemenmaki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been called back by nature since then.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he said.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle hidden in Rhöndorf
With the hiding of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (sight of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the Slogan secret.
At the end of August, there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a climax of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", ask the makers of the action since yesterday at the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (naturally!)," they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
"But we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
In the action it is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is true to make a single promise, one that gives the city an inconsistent single-set feature."
Finally, they are in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be charged to the city of Bad Honnef its new roofmark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) consults on retirement and transport in the officer corps.
This week too.
On the first look at a normal process.
But nothing is routine for the Turkish forces a year after the pussy attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the Presidency of the Head of Government, the five vice-premiers, as well as the Ministers of Defence, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, took part in the discussions.
This is why the civilians in YAS were in a large number.
The government is attracting the throats in the military.
Head of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Marine were dismissed.
Since the failure of the coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the series of armies - mostly because of claimed connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Golden, which Erdogan sees as a wire-driver of the pussy trial.
To 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the pussy test, they have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the pussy, Erdogan had referred to the entrance attempt as "God's gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean the army".
But did Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "Unpleasantness in the military headquarters".
In the General Stamp there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which emerges among other things in the abolition of the head-dive ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large cleaning of the army and the security forces continue.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 officials fired, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had counted the military.
The generals were previously considered as the actual gentlemen of the country.
Their role as guards of the world’s rule was three times called upon.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan step-by-step the power of the military, not least under appeal to the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan aims to promote the Islamization of armies.
In the Magazine "Vocal Europe" a namely unnamed officer who, after the putch trial, was looking for persecution in abroad asylum, warned the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such a development could not leave the Nato cold.
There is no doubt in the Alliance after cleaning the willingness of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "swaped," says Nato Diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides that legal immigrants should be reduced to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining visa for temporary employment permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the United States will spend green cards to citizens from other countries."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to resettle track for racing steering shuttle
Again and again, in the past months, the future of the racing shuttle has been struggled - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the maroded route on which the tourist railway is driving.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the racing shuttle, according to the Ministry of Transport, it is still going to start construction on the route this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and resettling the Ilmenau railway, the country confesses to this particularly important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
The costs for the repair of the route were approximately 2.5 million euros.
From this sum, the country takes 75 per cent.
The Treaty on which the shuttle is also intended to be ordered by the country in the future will currently be finalised, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Thüringen railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the driving plan, the used vehicles and quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years.
This was intended to order the racing shuttle regularly on December 2017.
The racing-shuttle is a most popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and the racing stairway.
During the last few months, pilot operations have been tested whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to order it regularly in the future.
The route is also very constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it could not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRC) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest wart and the type of fingernail.
"The people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get to see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern sex pups have developed from their upblazing partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye colour over the form of breast wrists to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, since many robots have the "Personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex pups have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" that give the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with a "awning" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," the website of True Companion swears.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just as real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or she can be "in a mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the advertising of rape, when you take a step on Frigid (heart here: contradictory) Farrah, worry you most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxxy?" says it on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just keep a different sex toys.
Their origin and their growing refinances point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional grant.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR observes their rising popularity, they remain provisionally at the edge of consumer culture.
But what is swallowing from the border zones can be very educative with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market allows them to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these high-developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who screwed to have attacked women sexually.
The most disturbing aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Girl') are not the graphic pictures, swallowed bodies and exhausted eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to real women as realistic as technically possible (also with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they are imitating the movement of a real body.
But, at the point, when it comes to their "persons", the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
Otherwise, they are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Girls
Trumps' great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney an inclusion of the healthy human mind
It has become a boundary knowledge of the Trump-Ara that the political divisions that polarized the US elections have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Thanksgiving, in the United States, newspapers gave advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.
We all are supposed to work to get our filter bubbles placed.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With the Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family with which she had fought for decades of politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but in a further context I notice that this also poses significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disturbing effect of his Presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and "trump", we refer to the terrible possibility that his girls will not let us go.
There is, however, a even more terrifying long-term scenario in which the Trump Republican of the right wing "normalizes", which appears suddenly as an inclusion of reasonableness at once in comparison with its standards.
I think today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - which both appeared as a very mild crime compared to Trump in fact.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify himself as an indispensable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the carussells of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are huge, the fiber glass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurring and the animals are turning to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music gives this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be satisfied with the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circuit traffic in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carussell is still a strange magic experience, since here two years of age, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carussell, I would have given him the full score, but, fortunately, no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to synchronize the review with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowing down of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not necessary.
The poor woman in the purchase house was laughing, while I was tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, because of the treatment of cuts, he was brought to the hospital of his wrists that he suffered after a case in his cell to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal from the prosecutors against a first murder sentence.
He killed Steen Camp in the early mornings of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to complain this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too careful.
The National Criminal Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the four-classmen of fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the discharge schools will go to the gymnasium in future, four to the real school.
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Civil House of Biesental in Epfenhofen on the Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school release, the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken courtyard but is then released to freedom.
This resulted in a musical with the title "The eagle in the chicken court".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it bread out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making out of him a chicken was broken, the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and turned away.
Afterward, the classes three and four showed a chicken kiss in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles, the cylinders wore to bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (kids), it belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wanted every four-class student to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school manager Michael Müller, who always jumps in at school paces, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time was now over, sophia Schumacher, a class teacher.
After two years of education, she is very disappointed because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the four-class clothes.
At the end, all students made a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first grades have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal campsites in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, informed.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegally tented people was arrested by the police in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released while a study is currently running.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have reinforced control of the free camp and placed substantial penalties to everyone found on a place not intended for this purpose.
The controls will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can penalize a penalty.
Software update for Diesel vehicles: What the subjects now need to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their re-equipment has been organized by the Power Traffic Association (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next few months, but have not yet mentioned an exact date.
Daimler has announced to sign any person concerned.
If anyway an inspection is due, it will be done in their framework.
How long should the re-establishments take place in total?
"Sworn to say," says Smethanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen that the car manufacturers are not voluntarily acting on the subject of the environment so far."
How long to update?
The re-equipment itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be time-taking to get a date.
What do drivers do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would resort, says smetanine.
Does a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars now threaten?
The ACE fears this.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In rural areas there is no value loss for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first price payment under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prizeholders doesn't want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) receives as the first rapper one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the Cultural Institution announced on Thursday this year, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreography Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored ones.
The awards will be given in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will organise a receipt and participate in the loan together with his wife Melania.
Lear, known by progressive TV series, has already announced that he should not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" he said, "This Presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to withdraw the funds - and that is a burden for me."
59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her viewpoint.
The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the United States Capital.
Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting are among the former prizemakers.
We make the city worthwhile
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city construction master, goes to pension next year.
The body has already been postponed - however, suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker is a city building master.
And the work still makes him a great pleasure, as he gives in the press conversation.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his follower.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
Thus, taking into account the regular termination periods, it is supposed to be enough time for an interpretation.
Since Haslach acts as a sub-construction authority for the administrative community, the applicant must make appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they couldn't fill them out anymore, the citizens would have to go for advice to openburg.
But close to citizens are important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have been gathered, which wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worthwhile," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
But in the future there are also varied projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofen-parkplatz have been encountered.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium anization is still the subject.
All of this will be booked with about 1.5 million euros, "if we make it right," appreciates Wacker.
"All things are waiting for great tasks for my followers.
The work here is fun."
Designed are available for a city building master of large playroom.
With Haslach's own construction and gardening can be responded to many things quite flexible.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monumental protection, it is important to have an eye for what fits in, when new buildings are approved, the divorced building master stresses.
Without a doubt, the city construction master is responsible.
He's Bauherr, "in the end, everything goes over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Highbau) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Depbau) for 15 years.
Also, that his follower stays long, Wacker wants to say, "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to conduct a completed study as a diplomat or Bachelor with a specialist direction of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of planning and planning of construction.
The city building agency is understood by high- and low-depth construction, construction planning, basic acquisition, administration of urban property, urban farm with construction and urban gardening as well as under construction law, including monumental protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway locked
According to the police, the unknown actors had thrown the blue bike from the railway transit in the area of the Leoben Road (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the nearby goods train had to be stopped.
The detectives go out from two male sins and search for them since the night hours.
A rosarot roller and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses near the scene.
"It goes far beyond a lusbuben stroke," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the deceased would have put himself in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the railway customers could also have pönals on the deceased.
The speaker said, "Totally, it's a "pretty" sum.
The damage was resolved on Friday afternoon, the railways on the southern railways could be managed without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen out on Friday morning, two of them involved remote transport.
Goods trains did not fall out, but they had delay.
According to ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of headlines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammable intestinal disorders.
The unhealthy condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and UK 300,000, causes stomach cramps and flushing, returning or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the subjects are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products to reduce their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid triptophane of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far towards inflammation, there can be an inflammatory intestinal disorder.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the protein building stones - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have produced a link between a bacterial cart - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammable darmileus if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctorian Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been separated, had not had this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the darm microbioms of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the stomach darm.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial cords were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing at the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a darm microbiom and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unmatched immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it was proven to be a biproduct of the triptophane metabolism known as indol-3-milch acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the riptophan values were half-half, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our stomach darm tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophane adjuvants from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophane have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the interior surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a Genie
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder-roll, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed according to popularity.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues Preparation Tournee and only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began at the Aviva Stadion when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "wonderful work" to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three from four, I thank the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have given themselves great effort."
Boeing 'malt' Dreamliner in heaven
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the United States of Michigan and moved into the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand miles.
The action took 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens the shape of a Dreamliner was to be.
The whole was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind is turning: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Chef, socially democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin before elections with some concern.
Only no disturbance fires from the party centre, just no counterwind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD-regated capitals with growing disturbance.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
It was deep.
And one by another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Niedersachsen, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows again: Red Green can't just reliably rule," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising group exit of a Green Deputy has crashed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country day election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-stimme majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner invited the deceased Dutch Green Department Every Twesten to return their mandate.
Transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the chooser's will.
Every Twesten has to return their mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Manager and Champion of the Greens to the Redaktion Network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," a SPD warrior sucks when on Friday morning the new Job message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, Prime Minister of the SPD of Niedersachsen, is here after the surrender of the Green Members Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own majority of governments.
It is the preliminary highlight of a series of major and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The Mize began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland Valley in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the colleagues at the time.
After the country day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It became too - and everything became significantly worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Plied hacked the party smoothly.
In the weeks thereafter, the colleagues reappeared.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him the next depth came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last powerful SPD country boss, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphil Harmony while his city was burning.
And because he did so pretty wrong in crisis communication afterwards everything that can be wronged.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Ministerial President has been in criticism for a long time.
Mickey survey values were added.
Yet, or perhaps just that's why, because in the past weeks it was increasingly trying to put accents in the covenant.
The former Mayor of Hannover's attempt to expand his power in Berlin did not hide colleagues in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They granted him because they promised that the party would be stabilized.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In fact, because there is no debt to the party-internal twist of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz hasn't.
Sometimes, therefore, the colleagues strive to keep their own rows closed.
Their wrath focuses on the Greens, and above all on the apostate parliamentarian Twest.
"It is inconsistent and democratic harmful, as Mrs. Tvesten puts her own career interests about the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD Friday Group, the editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament, not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the national list of the Dutch Greens, so the Dutch Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Friday fraction, complains about an "undemocratic manöver".
"The electoral will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan because he was the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate to the Federal Day election, the RND.
"Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU commissioner distorts the election result," said Oppermann.
He asked to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funds for Ortsschern III
Anyone who wants to resettle his house in the years can soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development were informed on Wednesday in Receiving.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look at what happened so far.
Since 1991 there are reception areas.
At that time, in the resettlement area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the sum of funds.
In the settlement area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 per cent.
For Schindler, the previous recoveries are a "success project" - it is eventually important to promote interior development and not only to establish new building areas.
On 4 April, the government presidency Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a reconciliation area III.
The sum of funds amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country, the remainder received from the municipality.
How does a refurbishment area now come about?
You will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to remedy.
Where appropriate, the area borders could then move again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the content of the Federal Country Programme "Social City", in which the Sanctions would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the re-vitalisation of urban centres, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out by objects, that is, per land.
The reconciliation area would then be set as a statute.
The granting period for the funds has lasted until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017.
However, until September of this year, the recording would only be carried out in the context of the questionnaire to be completed by the parties involved in the resettlement area.
In November or December, the statute decision is to be taken as far as possible in order to start the repairs in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban defects and deciding when to resettle and in what extent.
It will then also be recorded in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come back to receptions and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landing book", which includes the constructional condition and the reconstruction intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Haushalt und Wohnungsbuch", the size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be provided.
The blue "operative book" is only filled in if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a complete questionnaire is not a request for funds at the same time.
In addition, reconstruction measures are not supported.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works after the "Windhund" principle - who comes first, is first.
You couldn't "reserve" any funds for later.
To conclude, photos of the project "Standcarn II" were shown in order to make the present ones "small".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between thumb and showfinger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the lockers of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a price of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers, according to the information of the military that was given to the TIME magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Vice-President of the White House made a round through products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a firearm car from Wisconsin and a barbecue stacker from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the evening of the event his supervisor, the deputy Marine Communist for aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 a.m., and so long until the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 a.m. this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours, a second crew would be needed for the return.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time at the plane.
From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act forbids Federal Employees to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could injure the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Looks like you're closed," the vice-president replied.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by Hatch Act.
But official events also have political toptones.
At the event, the President gave an incentive for the reform of the health reform in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to impair government legislation.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political benefits.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use only for a photo-OP, is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the President's plane was carried out in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the president's aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is excited by the show "Made in America" - which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials," said the Vice-President of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units fled 11 hours on this day for "non-Presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other receipts presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for the president's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the hours tariffs of the US Defence Ministry for the financial year 2017, the doD refund rate for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.
The unit records the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the marine corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is extremely misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take account of the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract closure.
At this time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked uncomfortablely.
It is naturally appropriate to emphasize that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his round over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firearm car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and laughed with the media about his own fleet of companies products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss our tough task
Top riders of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga enter at the table third Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will arrive in Kiel at the table three Searchsdorfer SV tomorrow from 11 a.m.
Despite five matches of unfair balance, the top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has gained the sense of reality.
In any case, team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Right on the back positions, I think the crew is very good."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorf SV, imports from the high north are especially provided.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to operations in the Davis cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This is going to be difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The Neuss team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue White could give Maxime Janvier.
If it is not possible for the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella active French party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first use in this season.
The Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, which has not been conquered by Chilene Hans Podlipnik, was still at the ATP tournier in Kitzbühel at the ball last night with the white-roaster Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Maté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the Junior World Range List in January 2016, someone from the trainer bar around Marius Zay fills up the box.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump was really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to reinforce sanctions against Russia.
"In his habit of adopting the law," the convention packed a few "constitutional regulations", he said.
The Moscow reaction was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was shocking against the US claim.
Nevertheless, the draft is intended to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
As a result, investors of the local OMV have since been concerned, co-financing the construction of the Russian Eastern Sea Line North Stream 2 together with other European companies.
The truck is huge.
However, it should be too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life.
He has twelve weapons to choose.
"The press" has looked at what the group could defend and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is pulled into the center in the heat of Netflix
Despite the second staircase of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix has not been over a long time.
The staffels three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third staffel, the DEA focused on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali-Kartell.
Given by four powerful patents, they operate "as a fortune-500 business" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian criminal prosecution authorities inviting to support the war against drugs.
Further new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staircase of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backwards: The city sets 46 kitchen services
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again.
With firm contacts for the children and a association to the team.
The clock is turned back in the town's children's day places.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld takes over food supply in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, vice-president in the area of Youth Aid, this is a good news: "We have all been very happy."
It continues to be cooked outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked refrigerated.
The city operates 46 children's day places in the Krefelder area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunch.
In the last Kita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables each, and the needs grow steadily.
"Now, eat not only children who are taken care of 45 weeks hours in the Kita at lunch," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay up to 14 o'clock."
46 part-time forces have from 1 September kitchen service: they warm the food supplied, complement them to salad, raw food and fruit, part the meal individually, give the food out, clean, and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group, as well as seven-group facilities - decides about the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more connected and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the Kita management."
For it is also about healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Also for the children.
"You have a known power in the Kita, a person that is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also revealed the charm of the quality improvement of the kitchen service that it has shown in the cost comparison between self-equity and foreign supply for the city as the most economically, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-administered.
"But these hours do not fall so much in weight for about 750 people in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The political role of women depends on Afghanistan's democracy, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the UN Mission Head in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the elections of the Council in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unlimitedly and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Province Council and the Presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to an electoral process that coincide with the transition from international fighting actions to a advisory role.
This year the elections will be given peacefully to the next by a democraticly elected government for the first time.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women registered from a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 years were supposed to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who were with friends at Kolping Street at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with their friends.
Then one of the criminals tried to grab the phone and the girl’s necklace, but that was wrong.
Without prey, the Duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.

GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade unions want to make sure of the long-term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow by the managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has ignored the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces other products of Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that if their activities were changed, employees and trade unions representatives would "experience as first".
In a letter to the head of the company's branch, GMB invited Scotland McVitie's to say, "that the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced."
The GMB Senior Organisator Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force focuses strongly on the local community and the large room of Glasgow, an important pillar for human employment in a area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic reduction of production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a florating production presence at McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland last night, and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continual commitment of employees and trade unions.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, regularly review our businesses - and this applies to all our businesses and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the location, the employees and their trade unions will be the first to learn this."
Has the PSG warned Barcelona three years ago before Neymar?
The page of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave behind in its persecution of Neymar after she has issued an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger its release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?
The sensational approach heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than double the previous brand, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the previous season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest-paid professional porter. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced out his way, although a source near the Catalan board is insisting that the club has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago of this prospect?
When Manchester City 2014 showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matudi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have the consequence."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG medieval player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Rolls thrown and damaged
On the night from Friday on Saturday, an unknown actor has deliberately thrown a roller deployed in the Kingsfelder Straße before the property number 30 and has thus caused case damages of over 200 euros to the vehicle.
Police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, ask for instructions.
For an accident on the B 215 between pride and reading, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his track, the driver had to differ from a VW Touran and touched the guide plank.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW at 19,55 at B 215, was coming from Stolzenau to the way of reading.
In the area of the surroundings of Stolzenau, a car met him on his track, so he had to escape right.
The Touran driver touched the guide plank.
In the car, matter damages were caused.
The driver of the arrival car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident damaged, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the contaminant vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report decharging Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases discharges Pope-Bruder Georg Ratzinger.
This is what writer and historian Michael Hesemann meant.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the Reform Movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he expected the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the dominant Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI.
It would serve the view of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret of their own failures or their false assessment of the transactions at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized the fact that the reporting of violence in the court patches would be measured with "two dimensions".
Regarding the abuses in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and disgraceful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but be noteworthy of the "grade of media manipulation", says author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethic Committee.
"The habit of denoting the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to think that is normal," writes Scaffire.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found eating."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beats were a very normal pedagogical means" to "come through with ridiculous children, like I was one."
They find it unfair to apply today standards to previous decades because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger has often appeared.
Unfairly, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memory band "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (represented in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he refers to the results of the final report.
What is exactly in the 440-page report presented by Advocate Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the explanation?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzens were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of abuse, 67 domspatches.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "So, in summary, it can be noted that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychic violence in many cases.
The punishment for the punishment for the students could also be more intense in the case of high emotionality.
Yet, in contrast with many other accused persons, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger believes to be discharged.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "exercising events of violence to protect the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students highlight their "humanity".
Secondly, he also appears to be a cholicist and perfectionist, who became hand-adhesive of the opener when a domspatz musically did not bring a top performance.
How do you recall as his biograph this final report?
Michael Hesemann: When you make your efforts and read all the 440 pages of the report from front to back, you have to ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger seems to be in it.
He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspect of intermediate or conscience in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
Violent excesses at the preschool also occurred outside its functionality.
In any case, you can prejudice him to learn too late about it or have not taken the first expressions seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was felt by practically all the subjects as - so literally - "rescue", "himmel" and "better world".
Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent witness, describes him as "warmhearted", "favourable", "familiar", "competent" and "understanding", as a very kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and Bonbons and "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also once led to angry outbreaks.
The fact that he knocked not only with chairs and threw the keybow on the ground, but also distributed earfigs and drew too freaky boys to the hair or ears, he himself confessed, deeply regrets and apologizes.
However, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.
Do you remember such discipline methods too?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what this report really deals with, namely, the abuse of sexual abuse and the excess of violence in the preschool, it is obviously a bagatell.
So you wonder if it does not have to do with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just crashed on him.
Many who have never understood it still work hard on the Bavarian pope.
The truth is, however, that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in all respects!
In the media, very much was reported on the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also charged with any development or conscience in relation to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Surely no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claims to have trusted the dome champion.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one of the others, "It was all very embarrassing for me."
The real problem of exposing sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chosorter, which would have been professionally a colleague of the deceivers.
How, then, do Domspatzen-Scholar Ratzinger evaluate the role of abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student formulated it as follows: "In relation to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the wrongdoer.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that it is calculated for him ... bows have opened more intricate or clearer or even more open than to their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report concludes that "the fact that students and/or their environment were familiar with him in the preliminary field could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
So in relation to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is to be free from any fellow scientistship.
It is not possible for him to be discarded, not prevented or brought to an advertising.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these violent crimes, as is unfortunately, in some cases.
In the media, a lot of "waltexcesses" were read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former domkapell champion Georg Ratzinger is presented in the "Wegschauen" report.
Does he have to live with this claim?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, in turn, an abuse of the report.
Because there is a clean distinction: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the court patches, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, we once say, other objections.
In addition, the report has been discussing events from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorleiter of the court patches.
All the terrible pedagogics, the cases in which boys of sadist teachers were frequently shaking and maltrusioned and underlying, were all at the preschool in Nachzhausen and Pilenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions had to have prevailed.
But they had nothing to do with Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he had only faced the boys when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most of the Witnesses stressed, was the topic "preschool" tabu.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although discipline already existed, there was no sadistic violence.
And this is just true for Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence".
Thus, the supreme suspect remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and from the transactions at a school in which he was not working and responsible (as the Witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again at 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the circumstances?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which even reproduces the report.
In this he points to this, "that the punishment will continue to be practiced in the preschool."
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when the crushing penalties were long forbidden in Bayern.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatic and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980, the punishment in schools was officially resolved in Bayern.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about "Fallstrick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing the past according to today’s moral standards.
That's where the chief's right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was absurd at all times, nor to what was broken in the preschool of contradictions and violence to innocent child seals, that is far beyond the usual at that time.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly on it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger have for the book "My brother of the Pope" in the conversations with you?
Was the topic of the punishment also to be spoken?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective, the court patches played only a side roll.
Yet, I do not conceal that he led a strict regiment there.
But it must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding necessarily discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world rank, true cultural messengers of Europe and its musical tradition, from the former nationally known Regensburger Domspatzens (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991), tournae.
With cookies and Bonbons alone, you don't make any big singers and any success in any area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about their book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really come to know Georg Ratzinger well and have experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believers and heart-good people who cannot imagine that he could suffer a little bit as much as a fly.
I get regularly with the number of former domspats today, 23 years after his emeritisation, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict to them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most of them today are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them close to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, surely that might be - but also a loving respectful person to whom they still look up today and worship them.
And please, again very clearly, all that is being formed to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it's very unfair to make a man, just because he's prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a median sin bock.
There's the evil intent behind it, just too obvious.
For the report that has just been published is discharged.
Now the claim would be to let no one know the Regensburger Domspatzen at last in peace without the Bayerns and perhaps Germany's.
