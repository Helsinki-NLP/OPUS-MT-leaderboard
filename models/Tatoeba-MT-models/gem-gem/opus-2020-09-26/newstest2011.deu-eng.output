What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "conditory".
The new Councillords of the capital from the series of ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "cracked off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD how they dominate the notoric snake, who has citizens in recent years, where today's coalition partners in Prague have been on the rude.
The codified vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Colonel Pavel Bém, has been borrowed some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils with regard to these new terms have shown a little darkness.
They at least claim that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
I don't know.
"I'm rather a new man in Prague politics," reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillord for Culture, on the test of the "Pate Wordschatze".
But also the Councillord Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use from time to time."
"Otherwise I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz in June before the ODS election convention this year, the editorial picked out six terms, especially those notorically connected to the Prague Magistrate.
The social democratics should define the terms "Voldemort", "growst Prague Golf Hole", "Go into the Conditory", "Stirnacken", " betrayal of the capital" and "blended".
Three Prague Councillords agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future Head of the Prague Schools - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even the listener.
The fifth Councillord, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from before.
"These things don't matter to me and how civil democracies interact, I do not judge about it."
"For me is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he reckoned.
As indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned heading said not to have recognized that Roman Janoušek is the speaker of the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-owner champion Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing, and the only term he made correctly at the test was "the biggest Prague Golfhole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to security, "but I know that rather from the newspaper."
And funny, "I'll have to go to a language course."
The "golf hole" will then be declared not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillord for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both socialists also know who the term Voldemort is for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where this figure is found and what it means to go to the conditory.
"I think that means to go to some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution, when you know it is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
However, in agreement with Březina, he deserves to have created these knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
In fact, there seems to be no similarly inhabited snake among the social democrats to judge the test participants.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's really no such thing with us."
"We call on the name, we also use shortcuts or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský - called "Hulda" by his party companions.
"In the school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Denik Aktuálně.cz has tested the name and see there - it works.
Mr. Weinert is friendly to the party partners of the "Old" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made attention to the elections of the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igraček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are the only one to allow social democrats to speak in the interior.
Hulinský does not like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummy Cup" is supposed to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulinský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to suspend the torture of "Hexes" and gave out a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are rather part of the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are unemployed and have no children.
If one of these women "werd" to the witch, she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are sparing this because they are helping to work and childbirthing," an order sister describes the situation in the capital of the Western African state of Burkina Faso in a special home with more than a hundred women who have been exposed by their communities.
The local government now decided to act against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason issued a brochure that is intended to interfere with the "hox persecution".
But the thing has a crochet.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written explanation.
It is also in other African countries that the witchworks are to be viewed.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured them over with petroleum and just burned them.
About this incident, including the server BBC reported.
However, the criminals claimed that the matter would only have been a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to your version, oil was enflammed that was used for ritual salvation.
After the group tried to "explode a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexes" supports people here without considering their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to deflate witch hunting, the Gambian President has properly joined the President himself last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, emphasized a monster-gross witch hunt, since they claimed to have a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this end, Shamane called from near Guinea for help that, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, took women and men violently arrested from Gambian villages and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai," said the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
The farm forced the incurred people to drink an absurd from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused tarm and kidney problems.
Two of the armed people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant from Bakala: He heats in the oven - yet pays higher rent
An elderly entrepreneur just leaves the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a catalogue of three new rental contracts for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just cursing a penalty.
All three have just been increased the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rent, the son is to take a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns in the next year.
"And there's not even flowing hot water in the apartment and you need to heat in a simple coal oven," he is angry with his finger on the new hire contract of the son whose signature he has a full power.
"But what - I signed," he explained half-professed and half resigned.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new hire conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish an instruction on how to combat such contracts.
But the man just turns off.
"One says this, the other one does," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rentals in Czech Republic, whose tenants do not pay market-oriented rents.
Therefore, Aktuálně.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG warranty room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device.
"Hause 2011", a special keypad lights on the touch screen.
Shortly tipped and already the device spots out a number list.
We hardly decrypted the number "157" and already piep it on the large display on the cover of the waiting room.
One half second later you're on the line.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and similar.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new hire contracts flat the most tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments of the Portfolio of the RPG in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a lease increase from about 15 to 38 percent in writing.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is running something over a week, that is, that's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch answer after a moment hesitate when the "clinist" as a journalist pops up.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a huge topic.
Before the elections, Parliament's Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek, who came from Ostrava, had handled this issue quite loudly by the ČSSD, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Don't even change the WC-Brills," the man mentioned at first, makes himself air.
To date, the employees are mainly hiring at the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rental, which promises RPG to them when they sign the special offer in time.
The benefits of a half-reduced February rent are also intended to include the other tenants who sign the new lease contract by 15 December.
Until now, "Dereregulationsschalter" in Havířov is all other than overloaded by demands.
"From the 360 yesterday clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this," the switch officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wallboards where it appears necessary.
However, if the lease parties do not agree on the new rent, they are established by an independent court.
"This is not supposed to be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"Nobody goes to court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13.000 (Crowns) pension, of which 5,000 remains for meals, where I should take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employee will be uncertain.
"Look at meals."
"Mr Zaoralek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she recalls.
The regulated rent ends mostly in the Czech Republic to the New Year 2011 and RPG Byty, according to the increase in rents, is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient for the maintenance of the housing fund," says Pavel Klimeš, the director of the apartment portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the negligence of the apartment fund criticized by the tenants is the main reason for the rental.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion of the rents in apartments, and in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-sized LCD display on the ceiling against the polster seats in the waiting room of Havířov, some red lighting information appears again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month" is read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increases the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase of extremely small rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter", RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rent remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents jumping to the height, but is gradually taking place within four and eight years.
What is more - the company is obliged to make a further commitment: all revenues from the rental increase (see chart) will return to the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal impression.
But - priorities are to benefit those who sign the agreements on the increase of rents.
The architects saw in - the office also belongs to a children's garden
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-child garden here, with everything that belongs to: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing space on the outside terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design last year.
The projection and architecture agency Arch.Design, from which the atleiers come from a wide range of well-known brothers buildings, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the rooms for its business ministry gardens.
In wise perspective, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are in the baby tree age and the company is concerned that the projectants return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening work, the children's garden is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to his employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction engineers and architects have so much easier to put their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The mini-childgarten is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they managed to win funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-childgarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and the Czech Republic's state budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be provided and for the duration of 2 years was provided for qualified staff and operation.
After exhaustion of funds (2 years) the Society Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-childgarten 3 more years at its own expenses.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, whereas the Company Economy Rating provided active assistance in the settlement of the application.
The children care for qualified staff - a nurse and a child-garden teacher, the children's gardens can visit children without age limits, although most of them are over three years old.
And as it is about a mini-childgarten, at the same time only 5 children may be present, but the day is changing over several children.
The farm of children's gardens is flexiblely aligned with the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the children's garden - without taking into account the business hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the Mini-Kindergarten is still comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The children are not only playing here, especially they are offered excellent education - from basic knowledge to preschool, and they are also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
More than that - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can at any time look at the children and thus lose stress when they get the children lately from a far - away child garden.
Therefore, parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer relationships here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their staff marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. See the Interiors of Gaudi
The roof meets like the back of a prehistoric ecstasy, the staircase like the spinal column of a dinosaur and the balconies are crushed fish walls.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local residents, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stones, tiles fragments and mosaics, which reminds of shoes phasads and widespread soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fasade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colours and textures that remind of nature and living.
Only when you see more accurately, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole fasade still works plastic, dramatic and special lighting strengthens the glossy of colors.
The same vibrant lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, landings, clothing elements of doors, even guckholes and performances.
The Batlló house in the quarter of Eixample on the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, which architects Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the departure of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to Gaudís' idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló house was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics at the Fassade were his idea.
However, many more artists and artists were also involved in the design of the Fassade.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Güell Park, where there are other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was obtained by the local residents of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "compassing house".
It is also said that at the top of the building the sword of the Holy Georg, the cartridge of Catalonia, is represented.
But also other sculpture elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizarre is already at their 45-degree necessity.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the constructive provisions of that time and was not able to cheat on them.
Before the beginning of the construction, he received the corresponding construction authorisation from the city, but the information made by him on the planned reconstruction was so vacuum that the fathers of the city were so disturbed by the result that they demanded reconstruction two years later.
Among other things, the Council's masters also argued that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public citizen stairs.
However, no changes were made, in the contrary - only fifteen days after the urge of the city district in this respect, Josep Batlló made an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was immediately granted to him.
The houseowner himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a company salon, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The ground floor was tailored to a jewelry business.
The entire six-stage building runs through a staircase up to the roofterrace.
With the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
However, Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be fully linked by opening the salontours and thus a larger society could be comfortable without having to abstain from some intimacy in the case of confidential discussions.
The house also received a pretty unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudís rebuilding, except for a new fasade.
It is also impressive to Gaudís' game with the light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum amount of light.
He simply made use of the principle that White reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The household owners decided only in this year to this step and this from the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was discovered that this is a fairly incomplete business, the inspections were kept, yes, they were also extended to other common and the roof floors, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for viewing the construction time is not a papal steel, it is 16.50 euros, students, retirers, groups and holders of tourism cards receive 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entrance prices to other Gaudí carts in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with your dragon towers, you should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed roast? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lay area - so matratze and rust make the good bed.
These must, however, complement themselves harmoniously in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
When selecting, many things play a role - weight, size, health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Similarly, the interior in which matratze and rust are subjected is important.
A typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex matrats are not well suited, as they need much longer to get "heat".
In addition, they are significantly more severe than usual polyurethane mattrates.
And - they should be used regularly.
Because if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a fixed plate, moisture is on the ground: it is not excluded that it forms itself under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Who has been a long time in abroad, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, will hardly be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"While all Iishockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their rounded shoulders, pears and hips, they simply need a soft layer from Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"These are the recommendations that I recommend among other things to sugar-sick people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in polster furniture.
That's why I've been dealing with many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among other things the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn the benefits of the Visco shame.
This "wonder" actually works very easy.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise, it swallows into the warm body.
Nowhere press it, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (worn fire).
When choosing mattress size, you should still add to the body size the length of the foot chairs, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, such as singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
It is comfortable and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bedwidth: "If you are on your back, you should still have enough space for the lightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the champion of polsters and space equipment who has been devoting for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomy of furniture and also presents this topic to professional schools.
At a double bed, everyone needs his own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise nothing remains but to mount the roast in different heights and that is not possible for any bed frame.
Fuzzy cartridges should be at least 14 cm high, matrats with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the shape layer and the fine polster.
"The feathers must not be felt with the hand or when they sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special roast type.
Fullly polished beds with mattress and coverage like collaborated Siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses are not lifted and the reference cannot be washed, what is already done and given today.
And as you lose in one night between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a huge (and stopped seven).
That is why experts reject advertising logics that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty for matrats.
Every thing has her If and But.
And therefore, a practical advice from the merchants: In mattrates of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, detractable relations, but it is recommended to use a mattress scout that you can easily take off and wash.
Even though the mattresses are usually made with circuit locks today, so you get two halfs after opening (most important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of it!
Or maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Likewise, they should prefer to fit the plate with ventilation holes (if not in it) and use matrats with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with sows of pocket feathers and fine polsters.
Polyurethane mattrates do not belong to such a document.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for unadjustable latte rods with 14 to 18 feather bars (e.g. combinations of Latex and cocos), always pay roasts with a larger number of Lattenan, i.e. from 28 and more feather bars, with lordosen support in the lending spinal area and the possibility to regulate the latte hards.
No matrats with feather skeleton are included on adjustable lamentary roses, as they do not respond to the ergonomic shift.
In addition to setting the sticks of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixture of the feather bars, which allows you to press the feather bars or even to angle them so that they allow the punctual incline of the shoulder of the sleeper.
Namely for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area at "lord mattrates".
The ladies are also thought of - these soft zones are enjoyed in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-lasting feather systems (Lattoflex) or roasts with point-lastic contact paths with so-called multitorsion feathering are defined.
The pressure is distributed on several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (to large and filled) headchairs for the right mattress and right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Also here is a rule: the head kiss should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large cushion appears, as it likes the Scandinavian.
In the side position, the head kit should compensate the shoulder height (in conjunction with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress).
Something has our modern mattresses common with the single (filled with hill) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their immixtures.
The new word "Bio" is also called "Bio" in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, polyurethane shoes are used to produce more and more common natural oils - for example ricinus and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means in mattresses, their core consists of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the production of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also get micro-capsules that spread fresh forest or laving dust while sleeping.
Also here you make a difference between husband and woman.
While a "cooler" plant extract is used in the males from birch leaves so that the matratze relationship can absorb the heat and cool off the body, the references for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts of red paprika shots rain the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Matratzes from cold swallow (he has larger pores with destructed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and much more flexible).
The combination of the different stitches (hearts) of cold shoes and Visco shoes results in more-zone mattresses, which know exactly where heads, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was given this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers of manufacturers and dealers offering two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the matratze Duofreeze with vico-shaum memory related to 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viskoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at nearly cosmic rate.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft at heat, in cool environment it is strengthening again.
Thus it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but it generally increases sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam materials are used not only for matrats but also for other health products, such as for special foot polsters to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children grows and thus considers more and more parents to monitor them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented for the flag of cars can be as good for people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette bag, but it should not be larger than a bracelet clock soon.
Many people have placed the case of disappeared Anička in fear and fear, so they keep looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of a disruption of their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that it is not about spioning around, but to reduce an effective means to reduce the probability that it comes to the tragedy," Petr Pilin from the Macro company suggests one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in the individual case, there can be a misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in your pocket without knowing about it, but we have not yet had such a case."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "shaft" and how to use it in emergency.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that a child, if it is not able to wear such a thing, will simply get rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they do not want to be controlled."
"When the mobile phones initially wake up great expectations with the parents, but they can be deactivated as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočková.
They also believe that it is controversial whether such an institution is actually helping in the event of an attack.
"With planned kidnapping, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be arranged."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they would also be looking for them as their sales would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says psychologists.
However, it admits that similar devices can be very helpful when a pedophile suddenly attacks.
According to Roberta Čech by the company RC Monitoring, the location services offer both for cars and for persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"With more expensive devices, even an inclination measurer is integrated, that is, if you fall down and stay in motion, the device immediately sends a warning with the name of the position," says Mr. Čech.
He believes that similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but only a special software is needed.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about devices in sticky wooden bag sizes, the trailers are similar to or smaller mobile phones.
There's always the risk that you lose them.
Mr Pilin from the Macro Because, according to this, it is tested in the present devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he only notices after a certain period of time what the police give a timeout," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to armbands or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of location function using the GPS system (like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many toothsnurs that you could embrace all the Czech Republic you can keep but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometres of dental snor, with explosions.
In the previous year, the Defence Ministry had already delivered 224 kilometers to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the army has provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the dentists - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the circuit of the STV Group, a.e. for lips of 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this huge quantity of fire, the MF DNES General Staff replied that the soldiers would use the 60 kilometers of dental snow annually.
According to army pyrotechnic researchers addressing MF DNES, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and females.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army Eieneral Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way, the considerable annual consumption of 60 kilometers of dental snows could be halfly justified.
This length corresponds to 25.000 detonations.
However, these army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies to the training of every new professional soldier two meters of tightness, the army has created a calm stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even in the face of the increasing need for pioneers and special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Invasion Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they have almost no longer cartridges for hand-fire weapons, so that the lack of funds are severely restricted.
To be silent from the shortage of the underwear.
"I don't agree, why they buy such abundance of fires from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to meet mostly as a dealer," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Defence Ministry, justifies the purchase hundreds of kilometers of density in order to ensure that the army had been covered with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the infectious snor and police and army pyrotechnics of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, not to be viewed as a soldier of criticism at the army.
After the expiry of the use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and is not endangering the life of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Defence Ministry is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres tower.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last 244 kilometer delivery," speaker Pejšek informs us of the position of the Defence Ministry's Buyers.
For a few years, the annual consumption of fires of police pyrotechnics, ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brother Army has exceeded nearly 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the use period.
Already because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of moderner and thus also reliable toother is also open.
The Ministry of Defense still has huge problems with liquidation ten thousands of tonnes of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty when the two hundred thousand heads of Czechoslovakian army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics addressed by MF DNES, the Czech army expects in a few years the same problem with liquidation hundreds of kilometers of old tooth snors, which it has purchased so "favourable" today.
Until today, the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition will come to me.
The victorious placement in the competition "Small Businessers of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Small Businesser of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success meets like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Only in abroad, he realized that there is a lack of good night possibilities at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and using a bank credit, he created a building house with five apartments.
If one remembers that he was a high school student in the sixth semester, this must have been a courageous business.
"The price-quality ratio of that time was annoying me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit in the house, which he then rebuilded step by step to pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurship in Liberec, he has managed to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé that we have sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders in the Franchise of Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number One of last year.
"The large share of this license sale for the business of hotels had just the victory in the competition "Entrepreneurs of the year", Mr Pytloun adds acknowledging.
The victory has brought him more familiarity, yes, popularity in Liberec and the environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even afterwards and I have to say that did quite well," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something take part in this competition.
You don't have to win as soon as you can, any visibility is good.
He says that he benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come to.
"With some people I have met thanks to competition, I am talking to regular business relations until today."
The glory associated with success is also, in his opinion, a little dependent on each of his employees.
And there he's at the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be given general recognition."
I do not really view this as a personal success, no, that is the result of good work from all of us."
"My name is just a little emphasized," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a quieter year than we had it in Farmet
The victory was quickly resolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind her.
The price for the first range of competition Vodafone Company of the year last year took up Karel Žθárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Scalece a company from the ground, making hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that this assessment has encouraged not only myself but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of the business history of Farmet, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Žθárský as a compensation for the property encaved by the Communists, he did not hesitate, his career in the company in which he was busy, suspended and founded with a few of his father's companions a company for the manufacture of plastic wagons.
Shortly later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success in the above competition and its medialation, it has also come into consciousness of non-school publicity.
"Not just that our customers now see the brand Farmet more intensely, our foreign partners also began to be able to cooperate with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country, adding greater value," says Karel Žăárský.
However, last year, farming was not just a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool-building products.
The crisis, which at that time was even less shocked by citizens, but especially companies, just reached their climax - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't escape this situation."
"The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take off," explains Karel
Sometimes a viable company must take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to control the situation and to keep the company in the black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was not willing to cut off - in investment in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre from the grant, we strengthened our presentation on international fairs and acquired main prices in domestic exhibitions," says Žθárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnover grows again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new victory a lot of pleasure in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel's guide.
A question of opinion that cleans up with stupid rules
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is for the fourth time part of the entrepreneur's competition.
Some stupid regulations have succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year's opinion survey "absurdity of the year" the obligation to create documents on public authorities available online.
More than a third of not entirely four thousand entrepreneurs decided to vote.
Thus the social insurance administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have picked it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require excerpts from the Trade Registry in the future when checking social insurance payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Bura
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "absurdity of the year" is to take all the regulations and regulations under the scope, fulfil the entrepreneurs in Czech Republic and to remove the stupid ones.
This is the fourth time of this year part of an entrepreneur's competition, which is organised by the economic newspaper (HN) and is enjoyed in the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were four thousand in this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to impair business activities.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a priority in the world," says Karel Havliček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship in recent years is the proclamated objective of all governments.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, Czech Republic takes the 74th rank as regards business conditions, compared to the previous year, an eight spots worse place.
The competition absurdity of the year was first exclaimed and takes place each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
For registration, the web address is www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the competition organiser chooses seven candidates for the "anti-prise" and allows the public to vote on the Internet on www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihnned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most of the voices.
For this year's opinion survey, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 senseless regulations and regulations have been reported.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of competition, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and fast roads or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to provide every two years.
The catalogue of this year's "Seven" has been published on the pages of competition.
The exclamation of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of a incident, which also regularly involves personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the association of small or medium-sized companies and traders of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the peak of competition with the party.
"Where the State throws the entrepreneurs knupples between the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year which are still unnecessary to the entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unwise orders from the world prove effective.
In 2007, the people mostly disturbed the entrepreneurs' obligation to report three days in advance to the commercial officer at the place of their permanent establishment to take an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by a novelle of the commercial law.
The duty to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Employee Office to the Employeee to the extent of up to 30 days - was resolved by the Law on Green Map.
And - all good things are three:
As regards the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation that it imposed on physiotherapists was elected to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two individual waves in the speaking room.
This Regulation was painted by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category worthwhile socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new one in this year's fifth year of economic newspaper competition (HN) is the category "Consistent Responsibility Company of 2010".
The fundamental idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We want to support those companies who are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurship on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vôdafon mobile company, who is the proclaimer and warrant of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the year".
This year's first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafon Company's main competition in the year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrally in the subject of their activity, their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague Software Company Et Netera appeared, which encourages the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, which then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who has been the principal sponsor of a Foundation Fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also cares for its healthy disabled employees, which represent 70 percent of their staff, and for which it was valued with the title "Consultative Company of the Region of Middle Bohemes"; in competition Vodafone Company of the year, she held the third rank in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, MiRyz Soft, the accounting company, which introduced a flowing and also reduced an average of 35 hours a week and this without a proportional wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is mainly buying for Czech producers, supporting civil initiatives in its surroundings and working in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurship and administration on the environment," explains her manager Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is also located at the health of his employees and has therefore acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic seats and keyboards, and also promotes carting services offered by a home-protected workshop in their employed homework and in business operations.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "Men in Distress" which provides concrete assistance from the Roma community," says Ondřej Syký, the representative of the company.
In particular, the activities of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region are also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance by its employees in the form of extra-business.
"We are giving our employees contributions to eating, working, increasing their qualifications and holidays," says Joseph Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Marerish-Slese region.
As regards the category responsible company of the year, all district financers of the Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August.
Wrong or incomplete answers in questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "the responsible company of the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible because it is just a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman by the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests on a public procurement
In the building of the soil fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took place in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken from the detectives in handcuffs.
He claimed that he had attempted to manipulate a precise public competition to settle refund claims in such a way that the sites offered in competition were to a specific stakeholder.
It is supposed to have paid Luboš G. a half million for it.
"On that time I can only confirm that the police are following a person for the delict of fraudulent acts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, Head of Pilsner State Advocate of the newspaper "Právo", could not provide further details about the current investigations.
24 hours later the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
In what way he was able to manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate it in view of the secret official information.
The speaker of the soil fund Lubomír Černá pointed to the question of Právo in this respect that the police have actually taken arrests at Pilsner's side of the soil fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and didn't join one of our employees," she clarified.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct term "Requirement for the supply of claims for the transfer of land under the soil law" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the property offered.
"These individuals offer a higher value of their refund claims to be compensated by the transfer than the value of the proclaimed property."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined and the ground fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was evidently available for information, who had registered on the request and since he was a justified person, since he had purchased a number of refund claims, he offered a property interests that he would withdraw from competition.
Apparently against a fat detection.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Soil Fund, which was persecuted in criminal law because he issued plots in refund refunds which had already been taken place decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. was also acquired by the ground fund, for example, property intended for the construction of public roads, in the place where the construction of the access magistral was planned for the trade area of Borské pole.
Later he exchanged this very favourably with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the property.
At that time, the house of the Council had to give heavy hearts in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the lands.
The household housing costs rise by a few hundred months
From January, households must not only expect higher costs for all kinds of energy, but also higher water and wastewater charges, and for heat and somewhere, the rents also grow.
Families will have to draw several hundred crowns every month from the wallet from January than so far.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to tenth more for water supply and somewhere you will also lose the heat supply.
The households alone cost some hundreds of crowns more each year.
Stark flow prices were reduced by all main suppliers, so debt is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only moderately expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here is also a few hundred crowns to be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for heat are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay more than 50 crowns per month, more than 1,000 crowns more per year paying families in Liberec from January.
The population of Prague again threatens 9 per cent higher water and wastewater fees and this in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent does not change, it's just 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague continues to be one of the lowest compared to the entire Czech Republic.
In the northern coast, where prices are already one of the highest, water and wastewater charges are to rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, huge rent price increases are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rent regulation will be disappeared.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents immediately from January by 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with this leasing increase are seeking judicial interests of the company.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, will rise by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech children drinking with remote and room beer is out - it seems simply too slow
Fernet, Rom and Wodka, exceptionally a good whisky that was stolen from the father's house bar.
These are the drinks after which drinks of the Czech teenagers under fifteen have to be most frequently treated.
There are no exceptions to children who have to sleep their cats again and again in the hospital.
This is shown in the experiences of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bear or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the children's department at the Mediterranean Hořovice Hořovice Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it's possible to get away from the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing him with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief doctor.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most frequently deals with remotes or spaces."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at basic schools."
"Smartly it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital recording are long not an exception.
Before Hořovice Hořovice Clinic, where he has been working since this year, he has been working in the Motol Hospital Children's Department, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career started with 12 years when she was first supplied with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly difficult case.
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dance party."
"The interest was that her mother did not seem strange that her daughter did not come home 48 hours," the chief wonders.
Just the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when kicking with their own sprouts is considered one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, there is no real dependency in the true sense of the word in children.
"By alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependency on alcohol and all the related phenomena are to be understood, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to Mrs Jurinová, the speaker of the Motol Hospital, about 40 drunk children were instructed in the home department for child and youth medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcoholic poisoning that required hospital stay are recorded in statistics.
Drunken children who are brought home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only such a bottle of snacks in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes, there are three year-old amplitudes on which hundred percent of them are trusted: Walpurgisnight, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"This last mentioned for two reasons - either for pain because of the bad testimony or for joy on the holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnight I have also experienced seven drunk children at once at the recording," stresses Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child, who spends the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better than a child who is fighting only with a unpleasant cat the next day.
In the morning the headaches resulting from dehydration and glucose deficiency can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid infusion with glucose and nutrients missing from the organism.
"They are obviously better to do, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with good peace, without hurting anywhere."
"You're only a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes degrading the patient's good laun by counting them the costs she'll cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in a acute bed will be good and happy to get a few thousand crowns.
"I used this time and again as a means of training when I immediately predicted to the children at the visit, what has cost their drunkenness and that it can certainly happen that they have to work over all the holidays to earn the money for one of these fats," adds Dr. Pelikán.
However, he believes that the healthcare providers do not take action in order to demand the costs necessary to heal the drunk children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighting planes L-159 of five, which exchanged the Czech Defence Ministry against the Casa C-295M transport plane, fled to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS seals.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of a foreign army.
In abroad, they have only been seen in manovern or flight shows.
This is the fleetable two-seats version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The other three planes are one-seat L-159.
These are still in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over it last week.
When she physically expedes the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defence Ministry, is not yet known.
The one-site fighting aircraft L-159 was again separated from long-term aircraft and this without any further deposits and investments from the resort of the Ministry.
"The two-seated L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to come out without two-site fighting aircraft, since the Defence Ministry signed a 200 million Treaty on the conversion of four overflowing L-159 to the two-seat version in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to carrying the fighting aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly stated that the company EADS is the carrier of aircraft L-159 and that they are supposed to serve for the training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the dealer's thing in which he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a Casa transport plane and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by Mirek Topolánek government last year.
The Defence Ministry had not declared any tendering procedure for purchasing at the time, but addressed the EADS directly.
The Defence Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, from which it only used 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
The purchase of Casa's planes is also likely to have a judicial rejection.
The European Commission declared the Czech Defence Ministry at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three planes of Casa, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer point finger than ring finger means a lower risk of sicking cancer
Men whose finger is longer than the ring finger are evidently at a lower risk of disease of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is intended to be linked to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this in particular for men up to 60," explained the co-autor of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should have a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but also 3000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study, the point finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was considered as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and show fingers were equally long.
However, in men whose finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to 60 by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already prenatal, clearly reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer point finger.
Previous research revealed that the testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK was known to him as a refugee, yet he has not believed that the relationship between the length of fingers and the risk of cancer has proved to be "complete".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the largest part of Europe, Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and streets is mostly fast snow, the winter servants were many places the whole night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between mile 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is some accidents of truck and truck blocked because of the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the transmitter of the Central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
In miles 91, a truck crashed, two trucks stood together at mile 93, and in this accident there are injured ones.
A few cars are also located in the street graves.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also crashed here.
The drivers should ride right behind Brno at kilometers 190 or drive over Brno and travel up at kilometers 182 at the location of Kývalka.
It is because there is a mileage of steady state.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened and this has happened at the time of access to Prague.
In Prague itself is a multi-centimeter thick snow cover and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, auto columns form themselves in Prosek district, also the street Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is in any case the metro.
The roadways are driving with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and the peaceplace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis stack will come together.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven speed connections due to snow waves.
For example, there are problems on the Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - reputation.
Travelers should have to inform themselves of the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m..
Most roads in southern marbles are only transportable with increased caution.
Within Vyškov, three adjacent roads are completely unfit, in the vicinity of Brno, snow waves and in the vicinity of Blansko are forced to use snow fries on some higherly located streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Also here you will have to use snow cleaning snow.
When they get ridable again, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the field of white carpates.
On the streets, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert scatters for natural protection reasons, there is a snow cover of up to five centimeters, ČTK led.
In Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of snow, most of them fell in northern cottages - placed up to 18 cm.
In the Marerish-Slesian region, up to 15 cm of new snow fell.
In Czech Republic, however, it is slow to stop sneaking.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the conflict there with the Taliban and moves the power relationship to their favors.
The new gun is like a super-eight cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting security of just a few meters.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, developed for this gun and contain high-explosive explosives, work practically as small granates.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the point of the target, but at any point of their ballistic railway.
This means that you can use it against an enemy that hides behind a barrier - a wall or in a protective grave.
Because it is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel fragments from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new battle gun is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is basically doing this: he shows the target and sends out a laser ray that determines the distance, he wins a precise vision point after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only needs to print off.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 metres."
"When you press off, the gun is picking up and shooting the gun at the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are transferred
The company Fujitsu transfers its establishment to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu transfers its establishment to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry specialized in computers and maintenance reported on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will have their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, a large office complex at the Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurter Stadtteil Niederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained that there should be 100 more jobs from the group in the medium term that have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large room offices in the Astro Park would be better able to meet the working way of employees.
Fujitsu had also been a renter in Bad Homburg.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region led to joy with the winners and disappointment among the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt Economic Deputy Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was once again won.
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management of the intent.
"We offered our assistance to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulty of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the outcome.
Now it is about preventing a long space in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu on the courtyard and the nearby "Small Vertical" was one of the most controversial buildings of the city with the rest of the buildings at the Marienbader place ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between the railway station and the Councilhaus a new city centre was created, both due to the massive construction of the areas used earlier as a parking area and the height of the buildings provided criticism.
In 2001, the installation consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, started Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was then connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid one year later.
The Fujitsu cousin in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees are counting Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions enters in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped basic rise - the Central Association of Electronic Engineering and Electronic Industry has its seat among other things.
Amazon locks Server - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform in the United States is increasingly tailored.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the list of flags of Interpol, is to be held after a newspaper report in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks depressed by Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the country of the Freien", the disclosure activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time) by short news service.
Soon the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had rejected the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic depths in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
With Twitter, Wikileaks further explained: "Prima - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with the freedom of speech, "it would stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks after the work of Senator Joe Lieberman research, the TV transmitter CNN reported at Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have wished that Amazon took this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to reject the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unhealthy and reluctant actions risk our national security and jeopardise life around the globe," said a communication from the parteilos senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for by the authorities in Sweden for rape, is on the list of flags of Interpol.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in the UK remains known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there were threats.
"There was even a call after a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange rightly fears his security, said Mrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Mrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former republic governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested that the responsible for Wikileaks discoveries be accused and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of Head of State Stephen Harper - evidently ironic - said at television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, a battle exchange was burned.
The speaker of U.S. President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "awful and absurd" that Assange had requested the withdrawal of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known spying demands on diplomas.
"I'm not sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. Government now puts the protection of its databases fully on the testing level.
The Vice-Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Action, Russell Travers, was appointed as Special Agent, informed the White House.
Travers are responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which were necessary after the publication of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. Government also announced that they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active, they should be endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've done everything to get in touch with them," said foreign official Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if this should be necessary."
Iron University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice skanditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice coming from?
From Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatier, in German somewhat ancient of the ice skanner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spoon, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the Province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he does not come by the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Iron University established the manufacturer of ice machinery in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can be complied with the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
There are also several days of special courses around the chocolate iss and practices in the home-owned ice parts.
Some dream in the Midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare to the smooth ice of their soft desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a artist from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and wants to do something in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice part in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelaters Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silent crafty and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget in his training the snake of the national and at least southern building: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is still a lot of romantics in it."
The first step in manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano climbs the basic ingredients of milk, seeds, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns up a peanut on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice varieties.
Instantly, the Doctor is entrusted with questions: Can you only produce ice cream with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you leave your own experimental desire free?
Luciano warns against being led to the wrong spirit of time.
Who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarcharch flour from the guarbone.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilisator, but only sell it within one day, otherwise it sucks in itself, and the customer bites on pure ice cereals.
Some variations on the basic mass are allowed.
It's going to be exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you thousands of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
either in the fruitsorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white basic mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cacao powder to the basis for all possible chocolate transportation.
Now the course participants are allowed to get to the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate and haslenus - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also undergoing the fruits.
More flavourings, more fruit pare - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss ice does not necessarily taste more nutritiously if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi island produces the working group that uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture raises the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculating task: If pfirsich pure is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra portion of sugar is required for lemoneneis.
Luciano draws out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruits (winzer thus measures the oestle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the computerery.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for automatic manufacturing of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamly and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation to despite, small panes are not left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his colleagues climb from top to bottom with fruit pea when the over-dimensional Stab Mixer disregarded him.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like that happens."
Controller in the wheel
The European Food Authority Efsa is submerged by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This claim now forms the expert group Testbiotech, which understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another efsa expert have been under contract for years in the Ilsi lobbyist association.
It is paid by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has collaborated with the Efsa test regulations for genetical plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The Efsa regulations are deliberately linked to Ilsi's position documents and thus deceive the manuscript of the industry, which is to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian parma.
It is already the second time that testbiotech has a collision of interest.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager has recently been unrequired or transitional to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta - and has thus changed the pages.
The Central German Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personal connections between controllers of the EU and industrial lobby, which made the Environmental Association as well as the EU parliamentarians lighthearted.
However, the Efsa cannot detect a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, are recovered as long as they are of high professional quality, are said in an opinion.
Of the experts working for Efsa, it is not required that they have no contact with industry.
But you have to open them up.
Kuiper awards his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobby contract.
In this case independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding test in animals and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how to find them?" asks then accusing.
This is how Angelika Hilbeck looks.
The scientist has been researching gene technology since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe in this field, as in the United States.
There are therefore hardly still researchers who have not been involved with groups.
Critical studies for companies would usually not be published.
"Industry controls safety research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell also has some concerns, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood for the Stuttgart railway station, the Tuba on his back.
It was Demo.
It's cutting.
The story is known: In September, the baggers had been pushed and had started to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions of depths of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large majority of the wing was in crumbs.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grey stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the brocks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He swears: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he said up one, he smelled like cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the chunks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest at Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone reign.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked at the departure in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would male to scars or disappear in the disposal," he says in his office, a wooden bag that was once a guard.
He was blasphemed and threatened when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the rest of the north wing from the interruptor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the departure.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were to continue.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents took one of the 80 kilos heavy squares, a piece price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of returning him in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardens, housebuilders.
They came from everywhere and had dropped away what baggage and trailer could wear.
The Stuttgart stones of the thrust have long been transformed into "Mürle" or to limitations of herbbeds.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He rises into his terrain car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
Jura he studied and cancelled, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stored 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he carries his treasures together.
He says he is the largest Altstein dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow are artificially shrouded sandstones.
"They once belonged to Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's hot.
"My favorite stone."
It's going the way up through the forest.
He points to a bunch: red sandstone, former part of the Karlsruher railway station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
On one occasion, the squares were part of the Tribüne of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Sankt Blasia Dom, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were used to hop by hand and moved with simple bottledryers and oxen cars, he becomes very respectful.
"It would be a shame if you were to screw something like that."
He hasn't become rich. He hasn't been rich at all.
But 14 people are busy with the rock dealer today, and also have settled in the woods above stone metal, a sculptor, a butterfly, a glass bladder and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the remainder.
Next, he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent fight for High Potentials
There's a ruling Andrang in the buffet.
16 students are pressing around lax breads, tomatoes soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car builder Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to be familiar with VW developers through the car of the future - and alongside Volkswagens.
In the competition around the smartest heads, many companies are now going into the nearkampf and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates in the hearing halls as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are reclaimed by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, the exceptional talents are tried to explore and bind to themselves in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car corporation wins around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of practitioners and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Sele from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come in contact with industry and collect experiences."
"VW can at the same time get to know students, look closer to interesting candidates and consider who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperation, so Cell, are not unusual.
New be that the students are so offensive.
"Sunst was the focus rather on the professional project," said Cell.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
In particular, they have to commend themselves and particularly have high qualified workers.
Above all, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will be even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic audit and advisory company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
It organizes expensive recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern cutting hunt, where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever may join, decides in two selection rounds in front.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants flys to the United States.
As the high-potentials at the universities are shooking and steaking, the shooter is increasingly growing according to the thickness.
"We want to get out of the masses with the race."
"Only a simple sailing ear was too little for us."
For talent hunters, the bill seems to be ongoing.
"We have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some of them stand in front of their finalisation and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct buffalo at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the pirsch classic at professional meals.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner Company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the growing problem.
At present, 35 jobs are posted on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy beautiful positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the uni-professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do practices with us or write his diploma work."
Expensive advertising operations are not required for solar specialists.
For this, the company is trying to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can't be offered by a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money doesn't play the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good rising possibilities are other crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld proved the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute creates an annual bests list of German employers.
To this end, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and are looking at the framework conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe expects from the placement also plus points in the job seekers.
"I think that applicants are looking especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as employers leads over your own employees," he says.
In the Branchenjargon, the internal Employer Branding, i.e. employer branding formation within its own staff.
Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise their employers from alone with friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with bands," says warrior.
Obama stops new oil drills
Before the coast of the United States of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drills in the coming years.
A prohibition has been adopted by the government in Washington - and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
Also outside the Atlantic coast, new drills remain banned first.
This was informed by Minister-in-Office Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is a strict ban that is intended to apply at least for the next five years.
Before the accident, eleven workers cost their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled on the pressure of opposition and industry to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, the supporters want to reduce the US's dependency on abroad ageing.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil pestilence in the Gulf have not been finally clarified until today.
The criticism centers the British Energy Group, which faces billions of demands.
An investigation commission on Obamas' order is to present its results during December.
In October, Minister-in-Office Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stopped after the explosion.
Afterwards, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At the moment, the competent control authority, which had been in charge of many prejudices to corruption, is fundamentally reformed.
Parallel to that, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loops for the oil and gas corporations.
The industry now warns publicly that the quantity of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulations than so far.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - even before the boring ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further time - the burden of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank site: billions of litres of raw oil expired has destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live of theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari does.
"Don't bother you," the ecoactiveist calms the journalists, "You'll get enough oil sludge today before the lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illustrate a boy waving up to the breast in the water with the clays surrounding him: In the rainbow coloured water gloss the scene is almost beautiful.
The fact that brown oil sweats under the surface is not seen.
In the past, she collected garnals here, tells Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, a boasted pipeline was poured out of quantity of raw oil into the huge moisture area.
Fisher from the nearby town of Bodo must now run six hours to get into fish-containing waters: the Ogoni land located in the heart of the Nigerdeltas is considered one of the world's worst devastated regions.
During the journey through the mangrove cumps covered by streams, the entire extent of destruction becomes evident.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat cultivates brown breeves, who diver his hand into the water, draws out evil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black lacritic stacks from the ground, allow sadly palms to hang their weeds.
Birdswerms, as they are otherwise common in moisture areas, are searched for in vain: as soon as the outer borders are silent, it spreads out as a tank station smelling earlier paradise.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in a constant risk to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
Andoni's settlement area is a battlefield that has been incurred for decades: over 60 years ago the first explorers from Europe, here organized themselves in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to set up its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company has refused to return to Ogoniland: while from all the Delta region of the three-fold size of Switzerland with over 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres pipelines daily, more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped, the oil fields are in Ogoniland, too instable is the group.
Every couple of hundreds of metres of stealing sites like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corrodated to the mark.
Once again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flooded into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: annually, the amount of oil, as it was in the harbour of the Supertanker's "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea in front of Alaska - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the continuing eco-GAU will be disputed.
During the shell group Sabotage and organised oil steel are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmental protectors see bulbing crops and leak pipelines as the main cause.
Shell adds significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner was proposing to the group in 2008: only the rate of defects on the lines is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smucked workshop under the free sky, it appears from the mangrove shapes: they are divided and swallowed up to the neck of oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly willingly spread on the site, a fire flashes: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First of all, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the capture cap, later drumped at the end of the cererosin line and finally diesel.
Thus Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with almost 40 euro cents per litre can still undercover illegal cookers: for their raw materials are for free.
It comes from "Bunkers" which cross the pipeline network through Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts throughout Nigerdelta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of raw oil daily.
However, only a disappearing small part of the temporaryly interconnected raw material is illegally distributed: fill the portion of lion organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankships and distort it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is due to the conversion of the population or the salt production method, the activist considers Akpobari purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not destroyed the fishermen's life basis so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotages nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the ratio of Ogoni, above all to Shell, was so devastated that only a decline of the group would be in question: "Maybe other nationalities such as the Chinese appear as better."
Michael gets nervous.
"Max time you disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil distributors are taken from the special unit of armies, they are not threatened to arrest, but they are probably a painful meal.
Also, the soldiers primarily originating in the north, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
"This fucking thing has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detecting detecting dangerous construction errors in A380 engineering works
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a "disasterous driving failure".
The Qantas flight line now wants to complain to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the notified Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have known much more happiness than so far: the Australian Air Security Authority has identified a major security problem in the operations of some A380 machines - and now warns about a possible construction error.
The potential deficit would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil hose connection, he could produce tired circuits and leaks, it said in an opinion of the ATSB authority published on this Thursday.
This could have resulted in "a disastrous drive failure".
Being affected by Rolls-Royce drives in 20 planes of the A380 series.
This is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She submitted a complaint at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said his airline would require damage replacement for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire a cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 operations have to be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian detectives announced further safety tests to the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the operations concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem had been considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the noise landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380, the Lufthansa replaced the drive as a precautionary measure.
The double-slip flight is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Country-wide snowfall triggers transport chaos
Germany in White: Overnight almost all the country of snow fell.
Chaos, trains and flights fall out on many streets.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter frosts Germany: At iron temperatures nearly the entire Republic is cut on Thursday - which leads to transport chaos in many places.
In the north and east, some 15 centimeters of thick snow covers are located.
Transport is strongly restricted on several motorways and many roads.
At the A7 at Flensburg, winter service was in durability, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent bows over the Baltic Sea Coast.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) is waiting at the East Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storms with water stands of 1.2 meters above the normal state.
In Saxony, snowswings on motorways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the meteomedia, there was a violet alarm level in the Saxony of Switzerland - the highest level at all.
Sometimes there fell 30 cm of new snow, fresh and strong winds provided confusions.
There remained several trucks and cars in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind resulted in steady traffic and steady state.
A4 and A9 were affected by snowfall in Thüringen.
According to the German railway there are major disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and North Bayerns.
Snow on the slides, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed pipelines and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, transport from Leipzig to Nürnberg had to be set up.
In the Thüring Hallfeld, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue helpers with clouds, food and drinks in the train.
Snow winds mourned across the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, a speaker of the Aviation Information Centre has already reported some cancels.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been deleted in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in permanent operation.
Although only a few strawed passengers are at the airport, still nearly 400 field beds are still available for them.
On many streets, accidents occurred already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died at the railway on a railway crossing in Eastholstein.
The chauffeur was easily injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: even here a truck was recorded on a railway transition because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had surpassed on a smooth road with her car at Askapburg.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already spin up with light bows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is searched by fast and stormy winds.
It remains very cold, however - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin storms
The German Bank wants to separate from its sign: According to a newspaper report, the money house seeks buyer for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring in the property.
The German Bank has just made its group seat beautiful: the twin turms in the Frankfurt Bank district have been modernised; now the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the costs of renovation - and look for a buyer for the two highhouses, as the Financial Times Germany calls on a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We're always checking if it's more useful to own or sell property itself and then to get back," he said.
In this way, Germany's largest credit institution will re-establish its corporate office in a short time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of a home-owned fund in mid-2007 and subsequently resettled excessively.
The energetic restructuring declined the data for approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers currently renamed to Greentowers, according to the newspaper, to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are re-saled to a fund owned by the Bank or to an independent investor, the speaker said, is still open.
Thousands Trauring About Dead Friends
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people have thought of the shattered mountains who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be safed because the safety situation is still precarious in the cabinet.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mining workers between 17 and 62 years of age were wasted for days.
A sin had been dropped into the casualties, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descend for safety reasons.
Following the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the companions.
The bodies couldn't be locked up until now.
Now family and friends with a Memorial reminded the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island at a bright sunlight in Greymouth.
They'll be silent for two minutes.
For the honour of the shaped mountains, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the companions were to be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surf boards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags waved at half the mast.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains would come back to the surface from the depths of the earth, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the attendees of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the Memorial.
At the first explosion on November 19, mountains had also been poured out of British and South African origin.
Savior workers began to delete a fire inside the coal mines on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases were depressed, it started cooling down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Fuck you, warrior!
Does a plate fit to the art cino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-epothesizes old genre limits with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his penetrators and lays his opponents with almost superhuman powers in a row - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabies killing methods and his enemies have once scattered the temper out of the living body when he has bad launs.
On the other hand, the inauguration says, as it is actually called, the whole movie is not a word, and also the other figures can be ripped up to one or two sentences or a few painful death crys.
Otherwise, it is silent and swallowed in the terrible beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wiking World offers the scenes of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cineasts with interest in existenceialism and very quiet camera trips.
Fine, if a movie has several target groups, only hurt if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been regarded as a type of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" but refuses to make his works with a little more humor accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse.
Most artificial quino friends are expected to be scared off from the sprinkling brain mass and the intestines.
The Action fans will die at the latest in pity when inauguration for freely interpretable reasons breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and holds an eternity in flute and fog before the crew appears to arrive in America and continues to silence.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a cinema loan and has now appeared on DVDs only.
This is especially a shame because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody fasad hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a strict action, it's all the atmosphere, a filmed fiber space.
And there is no escape for the watcher.
Refn is hardly a moment of relaxation and screws him with his iron pictures and the dark trance-like sound track very slowly to the throat, but especially with the infamiliar hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy who is faithful to the side of the eye keeps himself as innocent, all others are driven by anger.
In the majority of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, at some point, becomes a warrior of hell, perhaps the Ambassador of the Devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for the corrupt ones.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to disturb, excitement and admiration.
It's an experience.
Mysterious Earth Works
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this - it still allows controls.
At midnight, on September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 km away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria claims to have built with the aid from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley that departs from the current.
According to a letter from the US Secret Service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, which was commonly used under the name of the nearby town El-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the fifties is hardly fitting.
The CIA introduced a video presentation with unscrupulous satellite pictures.
By computer animation, she embarked where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been acknowledged just before the launch, it said, but it was not yet fitted with brands.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than then, yes, the puzzles became more widely in time.
The former US president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in El-Kibar, but hardly saw evidence that there was an active nuclear program in the country.
Some Secret Services in Europe prefer to be more cautious and only speak of a "dependent reactor", even if they think that the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asking how sure he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat in summer answered only lapidar that IAEA has "for good material to ask questions".
The shooting of the claimed "unused military building" made the Syrians fast side by side and planned the area thoroughly.
In June 2008, however, a IAEA team was found in El-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from the time directly after the attack that would seem to be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always delighted to never operate a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The Uran came from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - just as about the satellite pictures.
In addition, the controllers refuse a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the drums of the bombed building.
But also Israel silences iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 is unreasonable and "developes into a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high western diplomat at the IAEA's seat in Vienna - eventually, there is a serious violation of the nuclear blocking contract in the room over which the IAEA is watching.
As the key to progress in information, the IAEA seems to see three other facilities that are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and are still different from that.
The inspectors have so far not revealed the installations or the function they have or what they may seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and made a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military support point - precisely with this reason Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to explore military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip of the U.S. Secret Services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the square on the Euphrates material was transported and transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
However, where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be distinguished later, there are at least plausible suspects on these key questions.
It is also unclear whether thrums that could store valuable traces were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks were disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shoot has remained.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which in 1998 examined Syria as a stock of radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But recordings from the spot show that Syria took earthwork at the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to eliminating the suspicion.
Furthermore, in diplomats, IAEA has spent several months on developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only shows the efforts of the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also abandoned this proposal.
Had western diplomats in Vienna yet a year ago, that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, some U.S. Messenger Glyn Davies has brought into the game for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who had to suggest these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: firstly, it needs a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are all other than looking for an escalation.
Secondly, as a diplomat says, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed regiedebüt in summer, there is trouble.
The turnbook wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, remains in love during the Yugoslavia war in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, whereas some of the short-term turning days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned off in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about UN refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie itself ambassadors of the UN refugee aid work.
She is not diplomatically - she has already offered women a meeting in Hungary for weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape cams have not existed, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the turnbook.
According to the UN Refugee Assistance, their organization recommended to release Jolie as Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her turnbook, issued a turning authorisation for Sarajevo after a few years - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The youth author itself delights that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war, and wants to give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains blurred.
Thus a second synopsis to the film in the network, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew it before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victims are crushed in torture slaves."
That Jolies film actually starts before war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on error information".
Now you can only provide the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the turnbook, as many before, illegally into the network.
Nothing like away here
That evening, it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No evidence of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans joy for joy with cracking loud music, they stabbed with the feet.
The Bailey Pub is in the Southern Cork because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and meet them.
"Bierpong" calls itself the bizarre spectacle, there are 500 euro winning premium plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this scary drinking game and the restraining computerist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to distract from the boring question of what the future will bring.
On his plan, there is no game fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct an application conversation in New Zealand in January.
"I've got a mulming feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "She had backed her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three sisters have already searched for their luck in abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as a IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Ire will probably leave the country in the next time, says experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 they even expect with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
Conservation of the forecasts is a wave of immigration similar to those under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upturn that brought great prosperity to the Irishes, Tristesse is now again widening.
The economic crisis is particularly insuring the young, well-educated Irishes, for which it has only been up to a mountain.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was used, there was money in overflow.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are a lot of readers from young immigrants who complain: "All things are going down the bach in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one then turns off the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future because the government only operates eyewashing and no longer offers young people prospects.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her commilitants are hanging from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, whether it is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men such as Stephen McLarnon are trying to retain the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a round service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, work abroad is a great chance to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
Show on his website photos Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was no more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January it continues to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's home is still rare, because he makes extra layers to pay the credit for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says when he, after a long time, steps over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine dwelling area with well-made gardens, parking large, expensive cars in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit funded.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
He's afraid it might be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan considers for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I have no children I have to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The construction engineer doesn't like the complaint he often hears at the moment.
"Nobody has to hungry - our situation is far less dramatic than in the past," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing can happen - maybe we're feeling that only as Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just see how it goes with life elsewhere.
For a few years of work in London, he has been behind himself, and why should it not work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
However, there is one thing that concerns him in these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could be part of a good-bye party.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says, and drinks a big swallow of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds terrifying."
"Let's rather call it a way away party, very quiet, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democratic routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change in opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly important in this year's survey in September and October.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economy has grown by around 6% per year since 2002, the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year, such a trend is recognized.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries in the region, are convinced democracies, which reduces the regional average (see Diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents stated that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the convention of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermines efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the world economic crisis may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(The UN Economic Commission's reports for Latin America this week reported that in 2009, the rate of poverty in Latin America increased only slightly and again fell by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in atmosphere from country to country (see Graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the divorced President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more visible and violence has increased, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many surveys in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime in the last year, but compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: approximately 71% of the overregional respondents reported that the private economy is essential for development in 2007, 56% (see Diagram 6).
Approximately 58% stated that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, stated many private companies.
According to 19% of the respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the highest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
However, in Mexico and most Mediterranean countries, the most influential country in the United States is seen in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
An electoral tape
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts were far beyond the fears of electoral assistants who hurried the land to help.
Overfilled voting thorns, multiple votes, voting certificates in the rimstein, destroyed electoral locations and intimidations were only a part of the problems.
Election sites opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, struck around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up.
A dozen of presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded the withdrawal of election results due to a claimed fraud.
Over the country there were partially violent protests.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as quite good in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which claims to be obliged to the unpopular chairman René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will proclaim the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected selection is available for January.
There's still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial inadequate complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds only a small or no consent among the voters, explains from the voter to the winner of the selection, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, a small participant was feared.
On the election day, many Haïtians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, about 250,000 proofs needed to choose were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, received a wave of sympathy, which drew her popularity rate by 20 points up to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you help to re-elect this next year, depends on whether the obviously grieving Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her dead husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led the economic policy after his wife's choice, often set up budgets that did not fully take account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to spend the extra revenues in their own favour.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the convention last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 resulted in further destruction.
Some regime critics from the series of dominant peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which one parliamentarian struck another face and others acknowledged the government of bribes) the convention failed to approve the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now valid for the next year, which will give the President more opportunity to spend money on its own good news.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11,1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage requirements of trade unions - are almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the Office in 2003, when Argentina was shocked by economic crisiss, declared growth and poverty combating its main objectives and not the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, chocked the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now?
It called on the private economy and the trade unions leaders to talk.
And, according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth thrust by a major devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, want to join Argentina back financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the former redebt of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to press on an agreement with the money donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6,7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected an IMF review, as usual.
However, last month, the Economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in creating a new national consumer price index. It seems to be the first step to clean the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active without the support of her husband after the end of her term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which mostly has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy brought to her will be abandoned.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she is silent and quietly lifting many political decisions of her husband.
Slight applause for China
Taiwan's chooser is slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the sea?
On November 27th, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, came up to choose in the five city districts of Mayors and city trees, which is considered to be a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
Due to the development of railway-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with the Chinese parent country since 1949.
Mom has been in the test, but she's barely short.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) has three of the five Mayors, it has not received a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports the greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes which KMT received 45%.
In the event of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city trees together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convois, with crush makers, flag-swinging mass circuits, and only locked dancers, occurred.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and chairman of the KMT, held a speech on a KMT candidate on the afternoon of the election,
When a man of the crowd shot him in the face. Line was wounded and a surrounded viewer killed.
Bizarrlyer is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill lines or attend a dispute with the candidate.
Independently, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and has pushed the DPP into a bad light, which has given the KMT more voices.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationships with the mainland have not been thematicized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social homes and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanans love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to emphasize its relations with the government in Beijing.
However, this time the DPP also avoided excessive scoring the anti-Chinese feelings.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan’s economy without China cannot survive.
Mum wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanans support their China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a dealer to Taipeh to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It's better to wait until after the Presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has now invented itself again.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he embarked on absolute independence.
But under Tai's rule, a new generation of geographical politicians developed, and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai found a great consent as a presidential candidate for the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Their party now does everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai is planning an idea-smith as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires non-profit discussions.
Tsai declared publicly that their party offered a "reliable alternative" to Mas prompt approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better in standing on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged pragmaticist Su to abstain from the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's intervention, the DPP makes it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mass of values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to run their election fight without it.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever more gap between poor and rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanans consider economic cooperation with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no more return."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly excellent in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear on request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take place at the ceremony at the time of the nobel prize release in 2009. Now, the 26-year-old Jazz-Bassistin and singer have been nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since its album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the Jazz scene, nomination seems a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules that a artist may have published before publication of the album with which he was known in the broad public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with their obscene voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a Jazz artist in this category of nomination Spaldings is next.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Among the competitors of Iyers include the "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raw favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary Jazz, where more albums can be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of Wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received attention in the category Great Group. He thus approaches the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventure-lusty Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life Ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a beautiful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra is listed with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an elective orchestra, with three voices.
Among the nominated with connections to southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and led in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer of Avner Dorman, located in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandoline concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, oper, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concert building Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra of Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wandererer" from the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" is nominated by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, parret for symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatmentes Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wandererer" were nominated for a gram.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded on January 4 in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the Instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer of L.A. claimed he wrote the 15-minute piece specially for the Mandolin artist Avi Avital, who launched the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra offering for a recording of the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumentalists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organiser Paul Jacobs, the Geiger Julia Fischer and the Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocalists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Precisx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, the sopraniste Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moschee in Temecula gains consent from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local Planning Committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critists were proposing for the project to promote both terrorism and traffic stop.
However, according to a statement from the Commission from Wednesday evening, the new religious centre corresponds to local provisions and will become an aesthetic eyecatch.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As Americans, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice exists."
"There are only few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting started at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre took almost until midnight, where the voices on both sides were quite evenly distributed according to press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no longer America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America's at the end."
Planned Islamic centres also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on 11 September 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His municipality with about 135 families has been living peacefully in the Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they hired together with a manufacturer for water filtering plants.
The new, about 2,300 m2 large mosquee in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be created at the large property at the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School at about 17.500 m2.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien bacterial arsenal that can live, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements that have been considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs phosphorus or arsene to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'external' form of life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report that appears on Thursday in the online release of the magazine Science.
Six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as scientists found out, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsen.
"What else is possible?" said the co-Autor of the Ariel D. Anbar report at Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for abroad life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, so bar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were given about discovery, gave rise to too widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on discovery of life outside the world.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planet systems organisms can begin organic processes using other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily defined," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenal content.
Since arsen and phosphor are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenal is primarily based on that it is chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that Arsen works differently from phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system where it is quasi swallowing everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in Arsen, shows that an arsen-based life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsen occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsen is not new. But there has not yet been an effective example.
Arsen occurred more frequently in the early years of earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life used it.
"There is reason for the assumption that life could have developed differently than in the early earth's age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authority.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the statement of the Los Angeles County Sheriff from Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as the unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals had lived before a Bellflower motel 6 nights, the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make any precise information about the foundation of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district animal home in Downey.
Sheriff representatives found the truck and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rod, and Didi, a 10-month old dog, were uninjured, according to government statements.
But Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week in order of their Japanese owners on competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the ACC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace should participate in competition.
As Peek of the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the ACC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the pair of dog sight to dog sight.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their carts in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - one boxer wounds, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with into their motel room.
The dicken Akitas and Corgis remained in the truck because it was cooler there.
They let the window open widely, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars as stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised everyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder wage is paid.
The lion rejoices again after the judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepared" glower plan to abolish the debt of $5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company the way for new movies and television shows.
According to the Thursday statements, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer be in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will advocate the studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is actually in force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself brings $75 million, leads the company. Financing is supposed to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the corporate management, who struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, known by his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay out the more than 140 glaubers of the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted only a few tenderers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which, after monthly debates and internal disputes, was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co, which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid for the management of the company each month $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio only brought out a film and created a year plan of seven or eight films to come into the movies at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two movies after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be created under the government of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can rip a considerable hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring ropes or about 48 doses of play doh.
But you can fix your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toys dealers - a whale mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider offer on the most famous of this type, webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are increasingly more button cell-driven toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batterys.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise indicated, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (mattle, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are peanut figures, as large as sea pigs, who sing a note when you press on your stomach.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by multiple pressures you can play a song.
Several Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: If you have started once, you can't stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed in the last year, the animatronic pop offers interchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new kind of scarnier feet with cycling blocking, it dominates the moon-walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as dance teacher, but their parents are complaining about the lack of volume.
If you are a child of the 80s, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back (hasbro/Play school, $40, for children from 3 years ago, with a whole bunch of questionnaires that can be a car ride to a lesson, with a better turner with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child your smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qvaluey keyboard. However, the games contained there are not as educative as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped after Leapfrogs' first large revision of the Leapster series with a new, clear screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, Scrabble Flash is still available ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a strike wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about compiling the blocks into words before the time runs. It is great for an improvised letter-stabian competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child gets enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
This can be rollshoes or a puffle beast.
The latest head cell-driven microroboter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your teeth brush.
The bug moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone bones in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a fooly garden.
And he'll endure a lot.
Our fell from the kitchen table and even spent some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped through a city place, checked his nervous subjects and issued commands with military authority and mutilated voices.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, to be feared and despised for their arbitrary racities and their hanging to violence - to impress the audiences.
"Stand up!"
"Click straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "How beautiful girls are like that!"
Four girls, hardly growing up the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight row.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white slides.
"For me they look averagely," noted Mr. Tang.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new candidates must have a university graduation.
The Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by Niederstarren: in 2009, reports of 50 officials have circumcised an unfitted imbis car and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened urban police lines. They have been selected specially because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
However, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese have from these city commands.
That's right, the critic.
Unlike the police, these officials may apply urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media regularly show a different picture.
In January 2008 officials in the Province of Hubei killed a watcher when he filmed her with his cell phone when they hit a protest action against a garbage container.
Last year, a Peking official training manual was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered after a multitude of hands with five official brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China when attacking road dealers.
"Chengguan makes the government scared," lamented the National newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are the current approach clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits in October, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both of them.
According to job advertising, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figures and "harmonic face-styles".
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment relationship ends with achieving the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the work for women over 25 is too hard physically.
"The most important is their image," an unnamed district official announced at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Of the candidates get the job, first depends on their external appearance, such as size, weight, faces, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women Chengguan is like flower vases," he said, "but they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the District City Administration, does not wish to join this description,
However, it admitted that in China sizes are not unusual in job indicators for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform visions.
Whether this is equal to good appearance, it is controversial to China.
But people with disabilities or physical disabilities do not have to apply.
"Unfortunately we can't use lambs or buckles here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that it was so much valued on her appearance.
"Find you, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic view.
Your colleague with the graves, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude because they have more ambitious career plans than simply shocking dealers through the streets to prevent them from making business.
Each morning, the strip is dealing with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bicycle before they are chased.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so often!" said Mrs. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had left his nudle kitchen attached to a bicycle car temporarily abandoned.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than efforts.
"It is almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studys sales in recreation.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report to their male officers.
This is intended to protect it from public enemys who are often exposed to officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumor cursed, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured during the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were killed or burned.
Xindu has been protected from such violent excursions.
But disturbances are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang place, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street neck.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the citizen's ceiling instead of in a workshop.
The owner cryed Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute hesitation, the officials with a cruel face went the way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripe, remained back and turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," says Mr. Li Nursen.
"Most of the time people start with the fight."
State prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
State prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations that were raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobby, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision terminates the most severe proposition against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that provided for headlines across the country and placed his career a steamer, he was considered as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "joyed" over the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's ethics committee could still impose a discipline punishment.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express its opinion on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethic lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. They believe that there was sufficient evidence that Design disregarded the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents that were first opened in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, led to lucrative orders to buy his silence over a affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure champion during an electoral campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take lobby work for his former employer or the whole Senate for a year.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely acquainted with the Affaire, was violated against the so-called ban on the spin door lobby.
According to the published Indians, "it seems to be an agreement and the violation of the city of Rotterdörrs," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer specializing in the defence of clients who are in the vision of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seems to be very cautious in taking political charges after a variety of declines persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to drop the charge against former Senator Ted Stevens for failure of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "is obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the United States' parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various accusations against Mr. Ensign before the court.
"This basically means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws are not applicable to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, head defendant of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a lawyer on Monday and another day on which he was told that the Ministry would not complain against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defendant had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had acted "in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going into the conversational details between the Ministry of Justice and me." He said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to set up the investigations for a separate complaint by the ethic group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Law.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money had been something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company passed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Stabchef, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, where he told him that he was in the Ministry of Interior for a case "calling".
Mr. Ensign was also arranged for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister for Transport to agree a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up for lobby work.
As last year, Mr. Ensign asked the public for information about this affair for the first time, apologize with his voters and gave up his position in the Senate where he had been in the rank of the Republicans on the fourth place.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he sought a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, declared the Senator hoped that the ethics commission follows the example of the Ministry of Justice and sets up his investigations very quickly.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call makes attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away into the crabs in the court hall.
In a minute, they sent their reports on Twitter about cruel witness statements.
At the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence of the jury falls.
But Mr Haye's lawyers have already filed a request to the court, explaining the reasons for a appeal, and which will be addressed by the courts on years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that the intensive reporting on the process - even through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has been a "circusatmosphere" and a so far widespread, prompt transgression of touching details, so that the jury was inadmissiblely affected by public disarmament.
This objection could lead the courts to consider whether new technologies will be necessary for new rules in the court hall.
"As I experienced during this process, I think it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the court hall affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' principal defense.
The President-in-law, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, showed the requests last week briefly back by decision when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But it was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, judicial objections have found that the reporting of famous cases makes doubts arise in the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Osteopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that the new media would have given a "carneval atmosphere" in the court hall.
Some believe that the television series and the movie "on the escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court objections, which Mr Hayes' sentence a half century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the ways of communication from the court hall, which were still unprecedented at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to worry about the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is dependent on its own.
Professor Donohue said that some courts could be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the court hall could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is only one of many who present the lawyers of Mr Hayes to discuss to years and thus delay a condemnation.
For example, the defendants also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel acts during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their teachers, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have been awesome.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecutor and that he had exerted unacceptable pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may draw the greatest interest in itself.
In a contemplation that they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media would continuously have re-exposed the flames of emotions about the case.
"So a day-to-day Andrang of the media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyers wrote, "has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps even throughout the country."
Your focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists stated that the claim that these direct messages are more vigilant than reports that are slowly remitted is a technological perspective that impairs reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that courts would often be confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, they addressed the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 1966, in which the judgment of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting and made clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign on shameful words and negativeness this week, little courtesy has been broken out in Washington.
Is it the Oming of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the top of the congress brought no break in the major questions that had been discussed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions were taken.
After all that you hear, it was not a courteous discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibilities, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the Members.
It seems clear that a thorough interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect, which eliminates the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is demanded, while it is attempted to consider the public opinion limits and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare.
The meeting was therefore limited to a minimum of claims or accusations by the participants on Tuesday itself and its assessment.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as it is possible to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
No matter whether taxes, donations, health or attendances, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Lastly, the November election Washington has at least voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush Government, who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise partial passion that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame dock session", the Republicans and democratics have little choice than to find a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end up at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increase in unemployment is to be expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford that they believe that the favoured tax reductions for the riches, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame dock session" and at the same time ratify the new START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session must not necessarily lead to the permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112 convention will be called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even irreversible.
"After the things that must be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
People are also skeptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - leads courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of things happening from today to 2012, as prefight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party choices which were appropriate to their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may be about the fact that they are too high in poker, they know they have to try to reduce their promises to reduce government expenditure and to exclude the health reform.
These party lines are already shown in the initial reactions to the Commission's recommendations on the deficit, which includes the reform of taxes and the lifting of some taxes, the increase of pension age and the reduction of state expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own opinion, so much urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But within the Commission they need 14 of 18 votes to make their plan an official recommendation and they are fighting very much to come close to this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the selected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little play space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the convention.
The first struggle will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republican Obama challenges for the state budget, taxes and health system, later followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proved that despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of the Americans still wish that the two parties cooperate.
If confrontation leads to a sack gas, as it happened in 1995, both parties must carefully take care of the public reaction.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic viewpoint.
Partiality and polarisation are larger today than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties view 2010 as a pure preplay for a far more wide-ranging election in 2012.
Thus, the courtesy that is brought to the show this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, on both sides there will be much more effort to find a common denominator in the issues that are still separated from each other.
Sicked US document portrayed Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "cleptokration" and it gives part of the cushion money and the protection pay it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy reported in Russia in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are pushing out high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, says it.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the head wanders up.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow Mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that it had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owned a well-known construction company, have rejected corruption allegedly for years, and he has won numerous accusations against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as in the report of the Ambassador, it is called individuals, and it is unhearted that this happens by a diplomate of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with crime has led some to call it "depressed" and conclude that the government acts more like a clottocracy than a government," says the Memo.
Crimeal elements enjoy a "crishna" (a concept from the world of criminals/mafia, which is literally "dach" or protection), which covers the police, state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layed structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the military are at the second stage."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors are following at the lower level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues that the FSB throws money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
A source, so says, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it is best to get the protection of MVD and FSB (and not organised crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, protection itself is very modest; even those paying are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to some pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases, probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucracies," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says corruption is inevitable.
Throughout the country, the corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked at place 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "at least corrupt" to "most corrupt".
The disclosure of the Memo of the American Message, which happened after Moscow's time late evening, will certainly cause misapproval within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused of the errors of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kreml to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angryly to the discovery that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we did not expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical ways, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a weakly illuminated, stressed classroom with dirty and blasting walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as "the Slaughter", the commander remains popular in this distant former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges that developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-term attendants are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community court of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it condemned the former boss of the famous Tuol Slong Folter Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Dutch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs was growing, their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her, life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rulership in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1,7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or famine.
When the Vietnamese fell and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Thailand at the border of Cambodia.
Here they spread disturbance until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to Anlong Veng the next generation.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN peace agreement in 1993 led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to the government, leading to the capitulations of Long Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested by government forces at Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh's prison in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
When their gönners no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few of the elitary officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the center of justice and reconciliation, which is held throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are anchored in the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, struggled around Anlang Veng in the jungle before going down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice builder.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before the court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the violent acts, but it is not said whether more than these four cases will be pursued.
This has contributed little to reducing anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on in Chaem, 64 years old, which had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey Province in the late 1970s during the Khmer Rouge rule.
In 2007, she told the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
One hot evening in Chaem came back from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun was long shadows on the dried grass, Chaem refused to discuss their past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court charged them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation centre.
"Sunification with the Khmer times means summary of the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the History Book for High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are distrustful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
On the top of the Dangrek mountains leads an overwrought and with plastic waste drought path to a rectangle of black rose, covered with a rusty bleak roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998.
Now Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile seller on the street edge, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she'll drop a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to collect no further armed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for the global safeguard of nuclear material, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years, the US government had tried to convince Belarus of not collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have achieved a barrier last spring.
But officials of the U.S. government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's 'Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 nations' in April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the Agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries lose its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"As preserving high enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally armed, and less enriched uranium," said Lukehenko at that time.
"This is our raw material... we will not make dirty bombs of it and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first launch to remove the Uran Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly diluted, says officials.
It was loaded into a special train, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, says officially.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by a plane.
The US government pays for these efforts $14 million, with a large majority of the money flowing into the Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-exploiting Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to resolve its warehouse by 2012, according to the common agreement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been stressed for years, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregarding human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key topic in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections from the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish state to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of Ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents forwarded by Wikileaks and the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that the former vice-president María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked the Spanish Government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which the aid for human rights rejection was accused in a thousand countries, including Spain, was discussed by the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President of the Government admitted that the report of the Council "had hit Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain did not object to the secret service flights through the Spanish territory."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unprepared surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "will not pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González gave his message to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to declare the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister for CIA flights.
"These reports contain no burdenful or sensitive information," explained the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Yet, the United States was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declared information of the CNI and the Defence Ministry.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments," complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, when the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of Innern Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "while the Spanish judges were crazy about their independence and did what they thought was appropriate," he gave his employees instructions to avoid "upgrading rhetoric comments in order to disturb the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Despite their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it from an indication that the government of Zapatero could be interpreted, tolerated or deliberately ignored as possible human rights infringements, capital will be struck, even if these disclosures could have a negative effect on the US government," he highlights.
The child killer admitted that she complained on the Internet about the "toll" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she is a little girl, she keeps contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications have been made from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life that reconstructs the ABC newspaper on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman took up a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
She kept a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she became known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former ones never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon she entered in another relationship.
The chosen man was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring congregation.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated themselves.
In March 2008 she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here for work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now he naturally realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and leave what he wants."
Later she mentions a message that she just received on her cell phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send you to the boy."
She complains: "If it doesn't like him that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll get him when I'm back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only stay there until 19 because I have to imagine a job on 20 if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she's taking her firstborn when everything's fine.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him with anyone except with my mother," a doubtful intention of considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on 1st of the month and was supposedly murdered on 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand, he likes it with me and the place, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will go to a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On 17th, memories and complaints.
"A giant Cuss of César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, such a shit."
On 30th, one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
Of Víctor, their current partner, there is one: "He shoots money for me."
There are communications from her on the Internet, in anime and manipulation logs.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser".
"Terror a la gallega (head)."
The last man who lived with her, a defendant hunting overseer, explains to have conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single parent.
Mónica was transferred to Menorca to Palma Province prison yesterday from the Centre for Judgment Prisoners.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she did not have the intention of adding damage to the little one."
However, she had previously admitted to drunk César in the bath and to put his body in a bag.
Defence and prosecution requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP already focuses on parliamentary elections - or not - and their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as the number of elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
The PPC reached 384.091 votes on the last Sunday.
If this rising tendency - the result of the redirection of the PSC's voice share and the binding of the PP's voters - should be stopped, the PP analysts forecast that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress delegates in parliamentary elections, while CiU also wins four (she has now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental significance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold its Members or win one.
However, if the election calendar is preserved, the next date with the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue at the scale to bring an end to socialist prevailance in four province capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists do not achieve a majority or react to their traditional associates (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican Debakel, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's municipality, where it should achieve 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of vote in the four capitals of the province and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's turn, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Ängel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Giant, the People's Party was able to notice a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida thousands of travel paces
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanians and Nigerians arrested by the Police Police Office of Barcelona formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Motion for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Attentates in Bombay, who demanded 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister has a major importance to these investigations, which is so far as he assures that the "Operation Kampai" has become the counterfeiting device of Al Qaidas worldwide "a weakened" and "sometimes their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could unjustly exceed the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only of the jihadist network that was active in Europe, so other European police units, except the Thai investigation bodies, have also contributed to research. It is not excluded that there will be similar attacks in the EU's area in the next few days that have been carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistan Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested in Thailand, where the Pakistan Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had led from Bangkok from the cells established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigation circuits underline that, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the travel paces stolen in Spain and then fake in Thailand, there were no connections between the arrested in Catalonia and the Attentate in Bombay.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before the attack of Catalonia from a money transfer company had been sent several thousand dollars, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, later used by the members of the "command", which made a end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have captured a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas a meeting of the tax agreement
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas its conditions to support his official accession as Prime Minister of the General Site, which do not differ from those already present during the electoral campaign and can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balance agreement that the regional leader wants to propose at the highlight of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party, with certainty, addressed Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 members who had won her last Sunday - a number that is more than enough to feel indispensable.
The future alliances that regionalists want to join in the next parliamentary elections depend on a possible entrance with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas is currently leading with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC party chairman, it demands that, in support of the official accession, "all disputes relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque country - and which the Head of the Parties of CiU even wants to be subject to a referendum.
Both political leaders are common to make the built-up political equipment of the regional administration smaler and to eliminate inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the official accession of Mas are discussed on the sides of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Care Home confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not exclude that their career killed over eleven elderly people
The Responsibles of La Caritat's Old Caritat Hospital in Olot, Germany, gave yesterday a press conference in which they revealed the damage of the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work.
Joan Sala, head of the old nursing home, came before the court in accompanying his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a social loss of view because it had not found the criminal acts of the career in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge arranged the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor personally examined the dead but the formalities were set up on the phone due to their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritat denied this point around and explained that "excessive measures could not have been the reason for the events at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there would be no indications for a person other than the accused person's violent actions."
The first crime committed on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different reassurance agents.
The head of La Caritat declared that the access of staff to the medicines is hard to control.
The insulin syringes and the reassurance cocktail used the nursing in six out of nine crimes to liberate patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less horrible death for his first victims or whether he burned them out inside by giving them bleaching laughs, as he had done to three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Carita, you do not believe the career's statements, even as regards the number of suspected murders that could be far more. This attitude is justified by that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it would not make sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to inform them of the scope of these events of justice.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors strongly responded to the threat of the ECB President Trichet yesterday, who warned, "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The risk rates of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB is able to deceive itself and that the euro has little to do with points that cause anxiety.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illicit market, which, in the extent in which it collapses, recalls, but as a result of the close of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to repent our liquidity measures, in which the ECB must make a withdrawal for the fourth time tomorrow in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Federal Bank called for the ending of the plan to purchase government debts, as they were ineffective, as well as the withdrawal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly tendering with unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to purchase obligations and to issue a strengthening signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be rejected from yesterday and when the neck is persisted in taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Similarly to the ECB meeting in May, where the Bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of government debts and to break down the markets thereafter, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, so she provoked a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year government titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's asset management amounted to only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 base points throughout the curve and reflected a change in perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million short-term and possible 15 000 more. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are confiscated.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the framework of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary consent to its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made its discourse more moderate in relation to the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is political unity asked to show that we play the same partition together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as the financial institutions, reducing government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment procurement measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange added by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect. Therefore, we are putting on a strong demand that will remove all doubts about our indebt capacity.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity which we do not need. The tax office has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed indefinitely.
Yet, our strategy should be consistent with Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the being, but also the shine."
Just courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen appeals on request of his children to the Association Assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not run away.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate gorp, will complain to El Enebro's company assembly, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16th, since he thinks they are "absolutely invalid". His children will try to receive a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Winegas Vega Sicilia -.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their struggle to control a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services does not seem to be willing to impose the control of El Enebro's institutions in his case.
He was driven out from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, which were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders meeting of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered as contested in the Trade Registry.
The company meeting of El Enebro, which was invoked by the Judge of the Court of Commerce No 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has launched a new thunderstorm in the family Álvarez.
The call of the Judge for the appeal to the congregation is the only legal way that ensures the convergence of the Society Assembly.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to allow by means of legal excellences, fraudulent acts and abuses of law to recognise the congregation declared in annulment of 18 January", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the complaint of the congregation in the afternoon to declare it "absolutely invalid".
In June, the same protagonists, who are discreetly silent, tried without success to convey a congregation in a courtly way.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the Service Group calls for the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the case which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the appeal for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull victories in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull in 2004 in the world of Formula 1, its history has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes in this experienced universe.
At first, no one gave attention to the newman and, despite his steep rising progress during the last season, at the end of November, all sat on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without trying to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the "private weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in hands, and thus created a victory team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that the German company did not have to deal with authors in 2007.
This PLM program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and highly precise instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russworm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in the formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be detected on races and tests can be designed and executed.
Russworm argues that in 1992, there were average ten technicians working in the racing stations, which could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
In Red Bulls Team, 180 highly qualified young people are busy today. With powerful EDV systems they conduct analysis and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull racing cars, except the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit that is set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that are allowed to spend a formula 1 team for its races in a season.
Red Bull built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his race cars in a 50 km away from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources that the Energy-Drink Manufacturer places in the services of his participation on the race routes, further protagonists whose support is inestimable and whose familiarity is equal to zero are hidden.
Steve Nevey, head of technology, stressed that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in R & D was 50% of the winners and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the shares have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) won his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday.
It is the first one of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees with the 16 already existing sales areas in the multimark business, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, named as an example the reconstructed shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, the property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working with him for thirty years.
The North American company group intends to set up 200 sales sites in Europe by 2010, of which 20 establishments in Spain.
The first were dedicated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrra did not want to betray the future new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for the opening of shops is always the same. They are based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products for contact). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it wasn't a Franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales office network was intended to optimise the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized enterprises in shopping and afterwards, even the packaging.
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service creates a connection to the technological centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve in ten minutes problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, since large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years to 'know' a million customers
The business leader of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but at first a new liquidity crisis is being discarded and prophesied the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it is predicting a breakdown of interest rates which banks are trying to compensate with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - an existing profession.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year Guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without using public assistance from the FROB but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 when you withdraw the clients who will lose the bank - which is the big challenge that this bank faces, because it has given more attention to its business customers than its private customers until now.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers are more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speaking outerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the Bank will present it together with the annual accounting report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, since the financial crisis has broken all the plans of the banks worldwide.
Sabadell will conclude its four-year guide plan Optima, which was initially interpreted for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficulty" year "with great reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only get out of the crisis "slowly".
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create work in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war of liabilities - which will be punished by interest margins - will have to expire, the risk supplements that banks and savings funds have to pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity, as a compensation for diminishing profit margins, will already be dealt with at the price of loans.
"The subjects of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on loans."
"We haven't turned off the hahn, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Already on Thursday, Banesto issued the order on its branch network to limit the granting of long-term loans and to increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks currently pursued the stategi , "to increase fees , but "within a framework affected by competition".
Sabadell's guide plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "greater companies are required."
"In the next year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "incredible" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be cancelled in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the monetary market in the case of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive a temporary closure of the markets, he reaffirms the argument of some bankers who already prophesy a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put in circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, it is possible to achieve short-term funding on repo-transactions and thus capture the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of the spare boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a merger wave of the spare boxes and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish spare boxes started, several spare boxes did not take part in it in the first phase. They held the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. Cajasol's involvement in the Banca Cívica Group cannot be considered a second round, rather, it was adaptations."
"The largest part is finished. It may be that we have 13 or 14 instead of seventeen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Directors and Managers of Aragonien (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process was "finished as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limited term which was established in earlier times, not now, in the context of the Banco de España business plans", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 spare funds with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with each 75 500 million is a historically inequalable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent and they are now much greater, with which we have fulfilled the Baseler Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained, "There would be a number of inconsistent opinions about the slowness of the process which revealed imeriority and insaneness," because "Banco de España admonishes us to conclude timely before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "possibly" in the world, and supplemented that those who doubted this would do "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy we have to "no concern" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings funds, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July had been very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to retain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have caused a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of time-working companies or the abolition of the 426 Euro support for unemployed who do not involve unemployment, until the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the assistance of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who has challenged the current crisis.
How are these operations to be understood?
It should be predicted that Merkel's position is not a mistake of her public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
Germany takes up a fundamental new perspective for the design of our future, which conflicts with maintaining the ancient traditions of a large majority of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, there are three possible ways of speculating the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: the re-establishing of the German Mark - although it sounds more like Science Fiction at the moment - is supported by a large majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a change in the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more macroeconomic control; rigorous budgetary management; punishment of countries that violate the rules; the payment of some countries and the expansion of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguished for some time, so there are no excuses now.
At the beginning of 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficiencies and the German government moved a constitutional reform from the army to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of disruption between what Germany felt necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country out as Merkel's decision to save Greece painfully.
It was strongly criticised at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and public opinion were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, Merkel came out in the last October with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow a country to be saved and at the same time obliged private loaners to carry part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, as it promotes the Ireland crisis and all of the following.
However, their proposal, although something has been reconciled, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures to take place from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not mean to exceed it.
It tells everyone that, even though unpopular measures need to be taken now, the old functions of the euro will no longer exist from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency where the contradictory countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves incapable of payment, and in this case the private sector must take part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high saving and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external sales.
The other alternative based on debt and buildings with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not only about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulencies will be more calm.
And that we will use the possibilities that will be offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in their own house, has prepared their way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is here, and it does not seem that something would change.
Among the possibilities considered, we should not exclude the euro area that has been fully stopped with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has warned us.
Sports and rule circumference
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The suspected exclusion of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink on it, whether it was an unsportal act or not and whether both players should be sancted by the UEFA.
As generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the end of the game (your team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the prescribed sanction at the next match against the Auxerre and thus go into the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the involved players with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport - rules.
Part of the upcoming debate on the present case is that a team of the Football Club Real Madrid (which is predicting in his hymne preciousness and honour and at other times punished its players for similar events) played the main role in it, and to the dramaticization by Mourinho, which added a episode more to his long history than theatral and provocating technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether these practices, which are not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradict the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are a rule turnover.
In this case, the damage caused by the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the counterplayers, an aspect that was not threatened by these acts, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the contradictory players draw an unjustified benefit from the counterparty.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under false or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the contradictors took from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was not brought into a more disadvantaged situation or benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is evidently that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually excrete. Furthermore, the players receive a sanction with this approach and go into the second card cycle in which they eliminate less than in the first cycle because of card collection.
It is not so clear whether it is really a advantage.
Finally, such practices are not contrary to the sports spirit, including strategic decisions in order to benefit as much as possible from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid penalty (which would actually be a clear case of rule circumference), they would rather choose when they undergo it.
They made a strategic decision, without avoiding a punishment or refugeing from it.
Although the boundary between invention and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics were created by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of regulated transfer.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethic than aesthetic.
Offeroffensive for customer catch for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar lets a lawine of reservations fall to the days 16 and 17 December this year.
The feasts paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and Christmas lottery, there are again group evenings that lead to Barcelona's restaurant and recreational industry. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they resolve a price-offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations in question.
In order to make accounting a little more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of December 13 with the result of a lawine of reservations from dinner to two top participants (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the previous week.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group evenings for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abstain from this tradition, many workers pay them from their own pocket.
Regardless of the conjunction, lowest prices are demanded, the chairman of the Barcelona Hospital Board, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
So far, the representative of the roof association does not dare predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people think about it forty times before they reserve."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will be good for those who " offer the quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save at times of crisis, and therefore prices of 25 euros are most demanded.
During a survey in various central restaurants, it appears that the evening on December 17 the suppliers lead to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, would grow. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, who enters 16 guest places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the property of the calendar has led to preferred reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, who guides El Mussol, Attic, QuQuu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter, the revenues have been flowing and good, even on a few days of focused views for the Christmas business.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price heat. You have the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts, so the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group food is in progress again.
On the sides of the Fecasarm Relationship (with collaborations such as the Barcelona Pensions, Restaurants and Leisure Association), the Vice-President, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living" as a whole, although the customers "shoot out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebration did not go back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistan Nuclear Programme is encouraging in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Discoveries of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the United States Department, which was revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear programme Washington.
On the edge of the clearing and soft details offering the documents on the content of the discussions and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened but, in contrast, "takes down" and that the instable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction difficult at a possible attack - prepares Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the suspected distribution of nuclear material and the sensitivity of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people implied in the nuclear and rocket programmes is no longer regarded by the United States but also Russia as remote and reason to take care.
"Pakistan has to set strictly religious staff to monitor nuclear plants; due to the low educational and cultural level, extremeist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who cooperate with nuclear or missile programmes," said the expert Yuri Korollev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American official colleagues.
New to Julian Assange's Internet Portal, the documentation is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan leaves behind in nuclear distribution and the increased rate in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", declares: "In fact there is no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit by the chief leader of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "declare to the responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to set up his silent support from terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the situation is difficult to explain.
Last night Interpol issued a "red warning" about "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
The lawyer also assures the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order on Sweden's request, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the authority.
This is the way things are. The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find out "to arrest and deliver it provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organisation, consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
The procedure rejected the lawyer Assange, who last published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the trip from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who received the appropriate approval with the state-lawed Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused of in writing.
While the world seeks him - and his mother from Australia deserves the innocentness of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he gave an interview from an unspecified location to the head of the magazine Time by Skype. He requested the withdrawal of the US State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who referred to the request for withdrawal as "awful and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions of conservative politicians and commentators today.
Congress delegate Peter King, who will be chaired in the National Security Committee of the House of Members from January, has called on the Department of State to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "taking their money and pursuing anyone who supports it or contributes to it."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Hokkabee, a baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who made information in the government, he is guilty of the betrayal and everything that is not execution is yin too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eye wrinkler.
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its continuation in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the principle of the full assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to disappear for the fifty time of an internal upheaval in the series of 11 Members and half of the votes of votes without direction.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the presence of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weak as its Mentor itself and will not cause him the same headbreak as other former flows.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with an eyetwinker, which would safeguard his position up to the next municipal elections.
To begin yesterday, announced that over 200 regional members of the ERC could express themselves secretly on his remaining in the office.
With election lists, not with lifted hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a penalty certificate to the President, they could do this without fear of repressalia.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and of submission to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel with half of the voices plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod nearby calls on the President to make his office available more than just to the party. A insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the top body of the conventions.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now on to May.
They expect to contribute to the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will be presented to the Council on 18 to vote.
Their intention is to bour for Puigcercós, which, in contrast, is to promise to place the convention in the autumn of 2011, which the party top already considers to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and he endeavors to enable the organisation to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted five of them, two of which are in the forefront.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the Board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should end up giving up the principle of the full assembly as a functional way.
In this way, he commends a reform of the statutes to allow the conventions with selected delegates to be held.
From the end of the full-meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which was already fighting for the last two conventions as obsessed.
Actually, at the Moving Assembly of 2008, the party management was commissioned to review the principle of the full assembly at a convention which was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date remains, since the internal revolts of the past years were not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the ground, the time could have come to retake this issue and to finish forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China explained at the COP16 that its country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of that country at the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon traces and to convert its industry.
He argued that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he declared that China would not change its objectives but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutional development and supporting pilot programmes.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China the authorities of the federal states had cooperated with those of the Central State and the municipalities in order to achieve the energy saving goals, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also concluded, some more years of plans have been attacked or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received money from other countries.
For example, he was referring to the programme for effective use of energy that has been introduced over the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
He explained that there is also a project in the Province for Climate Change, another project for the exchange of traditional glue bears by energy saving beers and another for the weakening and adaptation.
Martin Krol, scientific government advisor in climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than commonly accepted.
He pointed out that the per-head emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while it is 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and is intended to take place by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist party chairman had the right to address the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN party chairman had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right was to him.
In an interview that took place before complaints Gabino Cué Montegudos as governor of the state, he stated that Espinos excluded was a local decision.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to apply to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance on the presidential candidates had never been negotiated.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, where his follower was elected.
"This (a Alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiation table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the election of the community, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he executed.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman who needs Acción Nacional for the next three years, and therefore he gave the fat "to those who the Council would decide."
"I am quite unaware and open there. I would be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the upturn of the party recorded during the last elections of 4 July will reflect in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it is about supporting governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which were emerging from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would be carrying the flags and observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into them, and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his disc-course under his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI attendants to consider the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could express such words as those he could make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no oral prohibition and even less a censur.
Obama works in Twitter for the law in favour of undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call on your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twitted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on the legalisation of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - the Law, then call on your senators and urge the adoption of this law," Tweet Obama.
Its short message contains a cyber link to a broader document that calls on the public to contact their senators in addition, as the voting of the law is about.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was distributed after the 42 republic senators threatened to block all voices for every law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 republic senators, could affect the voting of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Concerning the blockade of the Republicans of the Law of Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that, once the tax issue was solved, a timetable for the other projects could be set up.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative for legalisation of undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Dream would legalize about 800,000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old during the last five years of living in that country and have been enrolled in a higher educational institution or army.
But the defendants of the law need 60 votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are dependent on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organisations of the predictors of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The democratics, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other democracies should decide to turn the initiative back.
Among the most renowned Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the representative house has a different version, analytists agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish literature and used the subtitles of her question at this time (on another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "make us in trouble," the Argentinian scripture looked sweetly against the audience, mainly composed of young people meeting at the International Book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this modernized table of Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then the Shultz marked as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and from a doctor to a doctor, who does not receive any answer, but the instructions for the guide of her story.
The infectologists leave her convinced, "Peedness is not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists who took her breath in the middle of the time, but who explained to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalytist reveals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story sucks lightened and concludes that it "on the wound only learned that it was really open and not existing". But she is convinced that the desire for the language and their traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'Lob of Invention', and in which the finger in the wound does not mention, but is discovered.
He tells us about a famous magic woman who touched the clouds, brought back far traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and reported about America, the great novel that was not missing from the beginning to his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflow of the stories told by the conquers.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), spotted the predicated witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with inspiration, even the feeling of embarrassment."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the crazy and liars who imagine things best," and there reality and lie approaches one another, where one no longer knows what side of the story is where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we inherited to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl to the round table 'The Finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted their contribution to the great wound of societal violence that affects her country - as well as Latin America - as a result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained after emphasizing that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
On the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also "this finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer", decided.
He noted that in a fast-living world the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also go beyond dogmatism, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and the reality, we need to nuancize: and Nuancizing often means laying the finger in the wound and disturbing those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also disturbing the mighty ones who prefer to share the world in black and white he noticed and invited to discover a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in end games, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles, given by their respective trainers, and the meetings characterized by contrasts are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in end games, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but he has had three decisive games, and so far he has kept himself well, why this opportunity is of very particular importance for him.
The Argentine has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has been a step back behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has spent the same team on the same end games.
The Sanist Stratege reached the first end game as a trainer at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the tears in hand with which he heard a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duell, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to start a relapse again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros ended unavoidably after 210 minutes of play, but at the elf meter he came with 3-1 forward and got two ways to record his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two end games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rivals. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by accident and free himself from the evil magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing is for him.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my devotion, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important," commented the steward when asked him about the lost end games.
The last end game has remained strong in his memory, he assured to have learned a lot of it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not peep the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players are also prepared, because the last time we were prepared with two elf meters to eliminate it, and I believe that this is a doctrine until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elf-meter shooting, he does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to come to elf-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared for it, we were prepared in the previous tour, but unfortunately, the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense attempt to keep the title already in hands, which left us something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not happen."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer just a second champion and to cost the glory that the titles bring.
The United States amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves before their conversation at the Consulate at the Service Offices for the application of a visa; the costs will be shortened.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States Embassy and in the Consulates are amended.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the Consulate at the Service Offices for Visum Application (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The ASC staff shall take up the biometric data of the applicant, which is checked by the Consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the settlement of the visa are declined, as the date agreement is no longer necessary to pay separately the processing of the visa application and the transport service provided by the document.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the contrary to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to conduct any conversation in the consulate, they only have to imagine the next ASC where they are presenting their documents and taking their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the Consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do not have to pay the service charge of $26 anymore.
For further information on the new visa application procedure, see the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present a find tomorrow which will have an impact on the search for living in the All.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA's seat in Washington by experts in astrobiology, which is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was launched, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for outdoor life", which caused speculations among experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in enemy environments, which were so far thought to be inhabitable, human-like creatures. It was raised the hypothesis that they could transform themselves into intelligent creatures, like humans, when their living conditions improved.
It seems that it is a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that was considered to be too toxic for all possible forms of life, since the lake is very arsenous.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there may be a similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenics, as the astrobiologists say, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that is different from the one we know."
Tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference, the space agency announces the actual range of its funds.
At the conference, Geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on the Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, who are studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) in the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the institutional law on the Congress introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature period had just started, and already a opposition block was installed by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined to be independent. The four questioned: the entry of the 'two parties' system into the chamber.
Before the opening session in the 60th Legislatur period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo contested the reform of the institutional law as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties who controlled the convention.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presiding office of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political opinion with these reforms.
He argued that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and they went out from the political will and if they did not have it, they would again be unfair from both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"To this point I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia explained that there were conformities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would be a pluralist group.
It cannot be approved, he continued that after being monopoly, the convention should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that a everlasting two-party system is to be ruled in the Congress."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and they talk to other colleagues in order to get more," said Convergencia.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, in recording on PAN and PRI, argued that the convention has currently transformed into a 'bate' for two.
"First it was only one party, now they divide them into two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to give them their place to the negotiations.
"The five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the negotiating table because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The city management of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
A further check over a little more than 200 000 Peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This means that the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued at a amount of 200.144,56 Peso was issued with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "accounting open bills".
Lieutenant Luis Miguel López Moreno had already forecast that more money from the community would go to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold at high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum that is still guilty of her and, consequently, the number of checks still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought with her, it's just paid the debts, as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "dive" in the last quarter of the year "recovered": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is legally required, if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the tax master assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million Pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where they entered checks in the value of over 3 million Peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the crash of a foreign tourist in the invasion of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourism industry requested to pay particular attention to the authorities, the areas that are in a bad state and throw a bad picture on the port town.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded that at various occasions it was required to set the destination and to transform the bad conditions of tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of roads and roads would have had a negative effect as the tourists would come to swallow and see the disorder, whereby they would turn back to the nearby stores.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not slowly and planlessly carry out the construction work in this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist’s crash would have made attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the sides of the city.
"The municipality must take on its responsibility and avoid that that happens again. How to do this? Well, by improving preventive maintenance instead of everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are waiting for a clean city. For not only because it is a tourism area, it must be maintained, we inhabitants also have a right to a clean living area. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that also look unpleasant and incomplete," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean and the tourist attractions constantly in the shot," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention and this kind of incidents reveal what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of Promoción Turisstica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not properly used and made a bad picture emerging.
He mentioned a number of places to be brought to front with the city. To make the city clean, proper and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural places that first have to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to bring them to the inventor we advertise for this destination.
IP requires results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take on the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business sector calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreements, to the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was devoted. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one by PT, one by Convergencia and another by PVEM.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, to feel obliged to the society and to the different social groups, which are dependent on a responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same pattern of partyity and patriarchism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Entrepreneur Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take on the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming them into corneal parliaments of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We ensure that they carry out a trustworthy work and take advantage of all things for society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people's representatives is the driving and joint work for the economic growth of the State, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation."
As regards the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the services to the Ministry of Tourism the necessary job value in the state budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two-two funds, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings exchanges and investments into the country and is in direct competition to the agriculture industry."
Tourism projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law which has not been re-established during previous legislative periods must be updated.
Holy King Searched
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys desire the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For the parents, it will be difficult for them to meet these wishes on the next three king day, because the household is not more than twelve people and a goat bock.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaias, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes that they want.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are said because my husband has no job, but we sell Mandarines and potatoes... I'll go with the makers to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie pop.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has long been looking for a 'monster car' and for its eight-month old brother Jesus suggests Cayetana clothing in size for one year.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I liked this monster', but I answered him, 'Let' us wait, boy' because it was very expensive', remembered Cayetana sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12; the ten-year-old Isaias has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help achieve the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is searched' by spending a toy or cash in the receipt hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, a production and sales network of cannabis was destroyed around the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will be faced with various accusations.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, which should have served mainly in the manufacture of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilo hashic, cash and equipment served by production have been confiscated," said Louis Philippe Ruel, speaker of the Quebec Security Police.
Altogether, eleven men and three women were arrested from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared hours after their arrest before the court building in Sherbrooke.
They could be accused, among other things, of the accusation of the production of cannabis, of its possessions for sale, of the complot and of the service of crime.
These house searches had been carried out as a result of a long-term investigation activity that took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said M. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the regional detection unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphre Magog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be persecuted without problems
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stepped in after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I strongly reject this charter."
"I hold with a party who put feathers to your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucus session before the Members gathered.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law allowing to hold any person who is identified as an unlawful immigration ship for up to a year, infringed as proposed by the Canadian Law and Freedom Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, Head of Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and all opposition parties seem to be opposed, so we will wait for what the government is doing," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the issue of immigration by Olivia Chow, NDP, has proved the critics who demand that their party did not stand firm enough toward the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree that action is taken against the blind passengers, and we are trying to implement this by providing another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the conservatives because he is looking for the guilt of refugees and keeps children caught for at least one year," said Chow.
Immigration minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties to play with politics and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these crimes affecting Canada and treating the country as a foot-treater."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," says Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative person has stated to the Agency QMI that the government would call for a voting so that every opponent may immediately explain to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the creation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collision since Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to demand the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropole has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Yet, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that, despite the presence of Robert Dutils, this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and members of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in punto public security as "made rabbits from the hat" and "reasonablely-based solution" at a table.
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"You will see the result when we will proclaim it," he satisfied reaffirming.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest persists in trying to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and politics at the ENA (State University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes Quebec to grant the financial verification a special mandate so that such research can be conducted through corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of checking," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow it to engage people in the statement.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the charest government drawers.
The Quebec will likewise require Ottawa to change the law of penalty in order to be better aligned with this kind of crime.
This demand is derived from the Supreme State Attorney of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law in this kind of criminal proceedings is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security, confirmed his colleague of the Court of Justice, Rob Nicholson, at the moment distinguished with certain novellifications relating to this dossier.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which covered the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 persons had been arrested, although the law was not novelled.
Ottawa has, as a result, implemented the law against gangsterdom.
Flows under strict monitoring
Several streams remain under strict supervision due to the high rainfall that has been cast in some of the province's regions since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, Mauricie's administrative region, there was a drought on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening there was a further grazing in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudie.
A street has sinked into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters of rain fell to several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of rainfall was expected here according to the regions until Thursday night.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the region of Outaouais were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had been down here.
Since these rainfalles are still to be added to the snow melt that has already been gathered into certain subareas, it is feared that several water runs are overcome.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service was proclaimed warning warning on the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The river races in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the object of surveillance and will continue to be observed.
In the region of Lanaudière, the violent rainfall of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as Rawdon have taken place.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge of resistance was elapsed due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the breakdown of certain lakes has caused the closing of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Ponte fraction.
The security service remains in alarm and monitors the situation, says Security Counciler Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec High Water Centre issued warning on the strong rise of several rivers, especially by Machinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly disciplined
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial opinions on social care and haitians as well as because of his outstanding speech on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their opinion, but certain statements would have "unfair information on social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians as well as such an unhealthy speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasting."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the spread of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the Code of Radio Transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 consignments.
A complaint by the "Front commun des personen assistées socials du Québec" was made by the first provision.
The activity organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Rather, the moderners should provide solid as misleading information.
With regard to the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont felt that suicide was an expression of cowardity.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the communicated message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crisis.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board took into account that the relevant consequences of the "Dupont le midi" mission would have circumvented a sensitive subject in family justice and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not deceived with any tadle toward his person.
The last issue was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-Moderator had explained not to have donated in favour of the Haiti aid, as you did not know with certainty whether the needy would really receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not misuses, however, that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already rejected my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," explained the moderner.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board pronounces the spread of an unprecedented expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted on radio broadcasters "besides its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who had to communicate his decisions once during the main end time within a three-day period, are small.
A king of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, which brills in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in the Thai box, now rises in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and to the box rings of the world.
"I have started in Algeria 12 years ago with fighting sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been resident in the metropole since 2008 to develop under the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who present the soil fight, like the mixed battle arts, they don't like competitions in North America."
Recently, his sign as a security officer, as well as the UPS employers, had issued bad news to his rivals in which he reached two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) in Edinburgh, Scotland, the world championship of the Amateur.
"I won the victory in the categories of the full contact Kickboxen and the Thai Box," he explained.
"On time I prepare for the world pocal in San Shou in China."
"It had been invited to those fighters from every category who had placed themselves in the last world championship among the first four."
"I babe in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I became behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China on the fifth place, while I became a third party in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I made progress in each race."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, allowing flashes and footsteps as well as floors.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rarer in a boxing ring.
The most renowned box fighter, which has come from this type of fighting sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, who is well known in the world of battle arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This race is the highest and most viewed in China," explained the sympathetic pound carrier.
"It is a little like the equivalent of the stadium lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"It was a super experience."
In the half-final of his category (80kg) he had won his first fight before he lost at the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four contesters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the half-finals each meet together at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their heads to crown a single champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved 450 million dollars of contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert in mutual agreement.
In the middle of this lawine of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consists of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the main share, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tendering.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a accompanying the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to overtake its responsibility, this important hydroelectric project at a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium "Energie gérance" completed the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Partie Québécois, withdrawal of company consorties constitutes a serious ethical problem which raises the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of a short game and defends competition."
"This means that you are now doing in open form rather than in a secret way," said Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, yesterday at the press conference.
On the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public's interest can be used in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded to it in the afternoon, saying that this treaty would have acted as a short game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she warned by strengthening that the PQ was "innocent" and it "miss her in hardship."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is widespread practice worldwide.
It is usually such a timely alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise with regard to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its workout.
The construction process is in progress and is supposed to be set up by 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without the possibility of a competition struggle; negotiations had already been made.
In addition, even in relatively simple projects, the model of the Quebec Consortium is no longer an exception.
As the "Le Devoir" newspaper said last week, the model used in the construction engineering and consultancy sector of the consortium was the subject of government investigations.
A short surcharge of the Quebec Company Registry allows you to designate more than 200 consorties, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau cooperates in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are dozens, results on one and the same legal person, namely, to Dessau.
As regards the "Energie gérance" Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territorie of Many James is subject to a special dynamic of labour and that Hydro-Québec has taken this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has delivered an explanation that has allowed the nose to shrink the fact that the contract on the project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are only few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this night and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the individuals," confirmed Laports.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts over over 50,000 dollars received by the Party Québécois.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the "Le Devoir" newspaper included more than 100 contracts of engineering and consultants, companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had taken 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They are totally $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Prime Minister Normandeau had justified that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their leadership.
Barometer conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but undefined skeptical.
The Quebec Consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but not much about the marked brands or the eco-labels to control his choice.
Damage, although it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where information for an accountable consumer is only such: the barometer responsible consumer has a lack of credible information to complain about an inadequateness, which makes itself known as the brake of his commitment, as shown by the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of the so-called socially tolerable products in 2010, the Quebecs seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec’s population admit that, in fact, to give as little faith to the environmental involvement of companies as well as to green business advertising, the measuring instrument exposed by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another find: half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official, supposedly fair products added certificates, but also the credibility of products and brands which declare themselves as environmentally aware, says the barometer.
Similarly, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously from only 14.6% of Quebec’s population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently survived by only one third of Quebec’s consumers.
In fact, emptyness and doubtful character of the information depressed the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This, according to the higher price of the products, is the second brake identified by the barometer.
In addition, one third of the Quebecs are mistrusted with the stated performance of the green products and services that they are strived to put on their hand.
According to another communication, over half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also prefered 61% of sales to dealers in their urban district and favoured the purchase of food cultivated in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop before its car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecs have indicated, used public transport in 2010 or prefered the car driver to demonstrate their ecological interest.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavior survey, which eats cliché ideas, have also supported the follow-up as well as bicycle riding.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, who was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallelèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallelèle, who had hoped to make a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentrise of Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to overtake this real cineastic function again, seems to receive what they demanded.
Although the government has accepted to engage in this matter, however, under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond in less than the initially hoped height, which could bring about an existing solution to beneficial conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources that can be removed from the state of rumor.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request for bits has been rectified since it was rectified.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is directing the Act eXcentris.
A few days ago, he had given her a final report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallelèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to answer them.
In any case, the premises of state donation seem to have been truly pushed to the side.
Let us recall that the Quebec ownership of the cinemas and the Kino complex had rejected a direct government investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Cultural Minister had no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not also allow other cinemas.
However, several other market participants of the segment complained substantial and economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author quino in the rooms of his cinema complex for more than ten years after the self-financed design of the cinema, which could justify the exemption from the State case.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus, as well as the Parallelèle company with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are encouraging a privately financed campaign, which they hope to make a sum of $700,000 in order to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallelèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called off the "Le Devoir" newspaper and is ignored what he and his group think of the corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Mystery of the complexly shaken Canada lifted
The new American diplomats that were distributed by WikiLeaks revealed the secret of what the United Nations consider under the Canadian minority complex to the Americans, but they open the superiority feeling to Canada with the same struggle.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voters did not mean Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the conservative government to implement their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, provide even more frightening details than the mere material content that you have to nap.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal election campaign was fully available, reports from which point the United Nations no longer participate in the actions discussed by their political leaders.
For the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador, set in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
"A Canadian necessarily inhabited minority complex may cause the Canadian, political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to the black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
Thus, he concludes, the United Nations are "the spokesman Goliath of this choice: representative, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The Ambassador understands this "orn-depressing silence" less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he evaluates, "it would be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party manager to conduct such a vital relationship that the elector has in mind as a key factor in the opening."
The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the communication sent by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa, which President Barack Obama was to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa on January 22, 2009.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government remains in the confidence voting on the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has arisen due to an exhaust programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," describes Breese.
Nowhere he had mentioned that the government had to stay the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling down from coalition and that the resistance of opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed life programme.
Another communication, dating from January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image of spreading the dramatic series from the United States through CBC.
The ambassadors are worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where few subtle plays of Maher Arar, which can observe "No-fly-List" or also deductions for the purposes of hearings carried out by the CIA muscle prote.
Another communication reports detailedly how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleagues Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting to ask whether Europe was willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is supposed to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of a individual "cause of case-by-case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he delivered a paper to the State Secretary in punkto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of the State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let us note that the comforts of the WikiLeaks website are warming up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "replaced".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
Last yesterday, the UN proposed a plan for renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the soil climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs released on earth, if the white-glow bears, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better by light diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to a equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global driving park.
Last year in Copenhagen, the large emissions centres such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should swallow down global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it is necessary to withdraw 5 Gt from this balance to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from being uncontrolled.
In the white-glowing pears 95% of the energy is exhausted in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce light.
With the compact lighting bears, energy consumption decreases by 75%, with the new LED glue bears, this energy requirement is once again reduced by double.
The compact fluorescent bears hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED-glow bears, such as those that the producer Philips marketed this week - this society has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and spend 80% less energy than a white-glow bear, which means an indication of the saving opportunities of the exchange plan to be used in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that this completely new kind of glue bears gives very little heat, they can also function with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bears have reserves, as they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except for the producers offering an asset.
However, the main source of mercury releases on the planet, according to the report, does not represent the compact lighting bears, but rather the carbon power plants that have much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the white-glow bears.
In the United States alone, these carbon power plants eject 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report details the profits each country would gain thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 carbon power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects excitedly announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "independent" publication of the results of the Côte d'Ivoire Presidential elections directly after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to obtain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," stressed a press speaker of the UN Chef.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Coast of Côte d'Ivoire to prove their responsibilities and to contain any initiative until announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure of certain foreign governments, the electoral commission, which was established on Wednesday at midnight, had left the deadline, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CEI on television had confirmed that the Commission would "continue the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second election round under the Laurent Gbagbo divorced from the office and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp expects, however, to cancel "deceitful" voting in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the putch failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast Presidentship campaign, had confirmed that the UN manoeuvre practiced to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had scared the president's attendants to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo contradictors are now more of the opinion that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who distracts any connection with the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the electoral results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His alliance parties confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results as he knows he has lost; and a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results, is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crown of the association and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned politicians on the Coast of Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible in the event of any excursions.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who took the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropole (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), in the sense of the International Labour Agency (IAA), the provisional seasonally adjusted information published by the Statistical Federal Office in See.
Unemployment rates in the metropole are 2.631 million.
The data of the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropole and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, unemployment rates increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In detail, 3,4 million workers of the French metropolitans were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were employed every two weeks or not or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
The seniors, on their part, have a slightly increase in unemployment rate of 6.4% in metropole (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50-year-old people, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in metropole (-0.1 percent point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France total.
Following a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Statistical Federal Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rates since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, on the other hand continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
To Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on the public and deceptive markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of the undermining of social ability, disguise of general goods, healing, intermediary in corruption, unlawful bribe and arms possession, so his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and intends to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brain spiders."
"It's easy to make a series of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove it," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before consulting his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the department, had valued to give the judge a memorandum to his justification before his hearing by his lawyers.
A member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than his deposit, which he had to lead to keep running.
Concerning the business field of competence or the destination of the associated fund, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this affaire, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Ballungsraum Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for disruption and competence, but then under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My Mandant was able to explain the facts that were sent to him."
"The Governing State Prosecutor took into account not to rob him his freedom", said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been charged and were released from prison on Wednesday on the night of Tuesday, including two of them under legal supervision, said Vice-President Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Vice-President of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is legally persecuted due to "unauthorized influence and passive bribes".
Two government officials of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title "Generation and distortion of general goods by a public service officer", the other because of "Membership in the disguise of public funds".
The livesmate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "sailing and undermining of society capabilities".
Among those who were confronted with Guérini were Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned due to a similar affair of deceptive acts of public hand affecting Corsica.
The flags suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X due to suspect fraud in the award of public procurement, in particular in the disposal, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
The investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which relates to the same waste from the Aubagne area as from certain cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde rice: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde rice, a young French researcher held in Iran because of "spionage", the French public in breathed, put the diplomacy into alarm and abolished the worsening of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, which went so far to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French Responsibles have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of young Frenchmen does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and an American judicial person seeking benefit from trade in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it believeworthy, that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the release of Clotilde rice, in a clear light.
In truth, he had not done anything in this regard.
A diplomatetelegram edited in Paris on August 12, 2009, has the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée consultant in strategic matters, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained her the French method.
They advised the Americans to put everything to their own nationals, which would be held violently in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "Articulated loud and clear and without fail" the words "Grund Human Rights", "Innocent", "only release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do that."
Because "Sustaine looses nothing," passing the discussion attempts on unusual ways, the Iranians are "master in exemption manövern".
Mr Richier adds that arrest of foreigners is a "general Iranian tactic": "poisoning for political oppression".
He announces that the release of Clotilde rice from prison (which should be made on 16 August, on the day she escapes into the French message) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro deposit).
And he lets assurable that the Elysée anticipate further hostages, a phenomenon that will "sharp itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde rice has been released from prison twelve days ago, but is still held in Iran.
An information was made in circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to the United States due to illegal trade with sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
The American message, as many other observers, asks about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who follows the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
At the time of a further discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebuke itself against it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judge's decision," he explains.
Mr Richier also wishes to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "stricter" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée consultant calls a telephone number, sets up again, then informs the American Diplomat, the Iranian, "at the time, in the buildings conducted by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the conservation of Clotilde rice in Iran, the Elysée does not make its efforts to believe by means of explanations and by media organized "flight attempts", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation has fruits as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from August 25, 2009 swears up "the media light of the French authorities".
What is based on so much "thanks" to Mr Assad, the Paris message asks.
"Despite their explanations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vain idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée has caused this fiction to fall.
The intensive communication efforts "in order to confirm Sarkozy's opening policy towards Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "prepared and unreserved by numerous critics votes in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role is constructive" attempts Paris to "pretect Syrias which can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also aimed at "saw a second movement between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told her: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Elysée.
In a commune, he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is admitted to a law called "the ashes breadel", which is forbidden young people to play after midnight online gambles by blocking their access, as stated government officers.
A legislative draft to invite the online games operators to refuse access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight, will be presented to Parliament in December, described representatives of Cultus and Family Ministries.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life every day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," explained Jo Rin, responsible ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse with this draft law.
The online games will be available again from 6 a.m. in the morning.
He explained that the manufacturer companies had been preparing for the application of the law for a year.
The government also focuses on requesting producers to push down the time limit per day granted for access to these games to the young people whose parents are asking to do so, added to the responsible person.
It will also provide free programmes for those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "interneted" countries, and the newspapers regularly report about various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also a disadvantaged champion in global online gambling competition.
In November, South Korea had achieved four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the teacherland
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the world championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the ranking of influence and lobbying threatens the technical criteria to the background.
However, one thing is safe: the edition 2018 of the FIFA king discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The issue of 2022 will then fall a little exotic; the International Football Association hopes to continue to win new territories (Catar, Australia) for itself after the Prime Ministership in the African Continent in 2010, or to pursue its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the degree of economic and political operation of a world championship.
So the craftsmen behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was standing at the beginning of the discoveries with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the chances for their own country, football weighing, which only once was allowed to carry out the world championship, namely 1966.
The BBC had given him a new nutrition floor on Monday by providing a documentary report, which takes three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English responsible, who had mainly committed an intense lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government hopes for a new edition of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-evaluate England's image before the Committee?
Nothing is less sure, because the Duo Spain Portugal does not lack of crumbling with its already completed stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial sides of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase Russia's chances, despite its gaps in the dossier (states, hotels, transport), to be a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to insist on the unrecognised expressions of the English press 'a unfair competition in preparing the vote' by the Commissioners.
"They are thrown with dirty, they are trying to compromise," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, the seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages toward Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries who had co-organized the competition in 2002.
Another threat: the license of the WM 2026, which the Asian chances will be declined to 2022 by the FIFA.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the presence of futurist stages, the FIFA pursues its extension towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, because of certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the vulnerable nervousness of the FIFA (as a result of time shift).
Second mandate: publicity
De Gaulle had really stuck.
Mitterand had made him think he was stupid.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current Head of State will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the openness is not well faced by the side of the mystery held by the presidential function.
So you have to do this as if the doubts are in the future.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone to take his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would allow the perspective of "two mandates" to climax on the elysée night before the UMP parliamentarians had spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Very missing.
The President reminded only that the constitutional change of 2008 limits the number of five-year periods of office to only two.
He made a finding, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such a meeting in a humorous sound.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new thing in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words from yesterday make him no more a candidate than the past day; but not less.
If they make comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal that Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS admonish more early than adopted for fighting.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer a candidature of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP about it," reacted immediately and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informed.
"He will always believe in ability to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of State documents
The last meeting of the ECB's Central Banking Council last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce a large number of unconventional actions of the monetary policy to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European government debt obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt to do no doubt, even today's more than excited situation in the European bond markets, in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in the solution of the government debt of Europe.
It has not awakened to say whether it is the opinion that the Central Bank could do more, for example by encouraging her programme of the purchase of State bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had shown itself in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee on its projects, but rather satisfied to note that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would be "extended" and that we will "see at the meeting on Thursday how the decisions will occur".
Only certainness: The ECB will leave its headline unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the treasury sales of the tax chamber were doubled by the ECB to about EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And, according to the indiscriminations of some dealers, it was supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Under the dealers, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchasing course is no doubt (see page 29).
The farmers have no longer expected a remarkable change in the course.
If bond transactions of over three months are already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still make up to three months of the unlimited reserves of funds.
The farmers are already insisting that this measure will extend by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"In other words, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in a short term," said Michael Schubert, Volkswirt, the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," suggested by Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB was to maintain such a purchase volume of obligations that lived on the market,” adds Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the European banks' exposed position on the markets of government debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no other choice than maintaining their presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price to the places of the lacking investors and act like this to prevent the rapid enthusiasm of the return paid to the weakest states," a important bond holder witnessed yesterday.
For if the interest rates are to be applied to high-level flights, the countries would be more obstructed from reducing or stabilising their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes to cover in Italy
After a weekly start for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decrease in the core interests to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Economic Minister, the regional chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indiscriminable" and had expected to hear him have a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately demented.
On Tuesday, the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 base points and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk increased to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council that the distinction of Spain is 400 basis points to the German interest rates.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed itself as "severe concern" about the "market turbulencies" and a possible risk of inflammation from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt am Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, distortive tax inputs that threaten the State to fail to meet its funding needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available for the Senate to review is 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will continue to be 4.3% of GDP in the next year (in contrast with 3.9% of GDP predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (in addition to 2.7%).
Therefore, the upheaval of a new budget collaboration, which could be used in a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"When necessary, new saving measures must be taken," says the economic inspector Olli Rehn.
At the time, Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundation of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are regulated, we have repeated this for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who has been trusted with Italy at the IMF.
"There are no problems at the moment, neither in the short term, nor in the long term, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) the need for lower stabilisation progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD's head-general.
Stay the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a request for distrust from the Chamber of Members as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized at the end of March.
So there is a slightly favourable period for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had explicitly emphasized it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think it has been proved on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans keep clearly together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although absolutely relative - the decline recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, a normalisation start cannot be mentioned yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, the most effective target of the speculates today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly affecting banking systems," says the nationals of the Exane GDP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time goes much slower than the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger in which it hides, intensify the discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected ministers of Finance and, in other words, with their counterparts of G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan is the loss of unconventional measures to reinforce the countries of the eurozone in the cross-border of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the investors in Fernost about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of his visit is not express fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first advertising expenditure of the EU Stability Fund will be planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Reuters Agency had entrusted the United States to support a possible increase in the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are sending forward to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms, which are intended to add to saving measures, but to show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are at any price to avoid demanding international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on irreversible structural reforms that bring their confidence back on a lasting basis.
In turn, European capital providers discuss the available options to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of public bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the passing in Paris on 24 November, had first produced the idea that if the billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take its own bag again.
The nationals of Barclay's Capital, with regard to the market of European government debt, judge that an extension of EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferential" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means: the European mechanism of dotted financial stabilisation, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A consultant who has all the chances to be carefully examined in the main cities of Europe.
Especially when market conditions are focused.
Snow and glatheis: 24 departements at alarm level Orange
The snow-episodes still draw up transport difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of the Bretagne and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Four and twenty departments are now in alarm orange due to the threatening risk of snow and glatheis.
The regions of yours, Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already at alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intensive snowsaws tang the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm are also expected from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the region of Paris.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are concerned.
The snowfall is considerably enough to cause traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional streets are locked for heavy transport of more than 7.5 tons, including the guingamp-Lannion transport axis and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Bretagne is very difficult, according to the traffic police who are not suggesting use of their own vehicle only in the emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the picardia, school traffic was discontinued for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the car drivers to take high care on the roads and adjust their driving behavior accordingly."
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to delete 25% of their flights from Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of the flights starting from Orly due to the expected strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends flight passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France is in full, it is calculating billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is intended to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, are recalled.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, the State has called for a capital investment of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical terms, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant on the markets a part of the financial sum to its double.
Today, first bills have finally come.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was considered this morning by the National Assembly Financial Commission, contains the measures provided for to make the first part of these funds available.
This is two of the measures: the creation of a special tax on the construction and higher taxation of the offices at the Ile-de France.
First, if one takes away Article 15 of the draft law, goes "to the public-law board of Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
Secondly, it is a new order of existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it to increase its product and to overtake this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
From the 4 billion, you're far away.
"The tax resources are carried out to be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital deposit that the State is charged and the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made for the project," the explanatory presentation is given.
In the SGP, this system is not found to be disturbed at all.
"Since the moment in which revenue is reserved (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then only create from the 4 billion," is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions are still available for a long time, is in danger of creating a quite moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Hacky hackers and emsite spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On one side, it has uncovered as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is just a scandal in the mind of hypocrisy, which rules the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces substantial changes at international level, and gives a preliminary taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act (a x-any nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "exceptional" American disclosures about the sexual habits Berlusconis cast nothing more than what you got to read over months anyway in any x-any journal (except those who own Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabalt artists for a long time.
The rule in which the secret dossiers may consist only of already known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and that is not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to Esotherian publications, you will recognize that every work (about the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosen Cruisers) repeats exactly what was already written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but he did not know where news about the non-existing was found), but because those who devote themselves to the occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the chief of the Secret Service (other than he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which had sent the U.S. embassy in Rome to the state decree, were the same as those who had published the newsweek the previous week.
So why was such a withdrawal made for the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, turned into spies centres.
Every viewer of detection films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen from shy holiness that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly injures the task of shiny holiness and is intended to put the American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that an x-any hacker can capture the most mysterious secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major struggle against the prestige of the state deputy.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims than the "sharp judges" in distress.
But we devote ourselves to the depthful nature of what happened.
Previously, in Orwell's days, all power could be combined like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has been perfectly correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction, the visited hotel, the chosen motorway, and so on; the citizens would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you consider what happens today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenger of the citizen - can bring the secrets of power to experience.
How, though, can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels in principle is a secret free of secrets, as it gives the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, it means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation, which has been added to such a mighty power?
It is evident that in the future the States will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be the same as an outhang on the street neck.
But it is as obvious that it is forgjeven with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of State went on in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships and for certain ears only be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction sounds like science-fiction and romantic at the moment, but I think I need to imagine the government agents, in a secret manner, to move on uncontrollable march routes, to carry their messages nowhere but in the mere memory, and also to hide the few written information they have received in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: basically, the spying attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing as a cancer today, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraf had revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegram with (phonic) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a video band for tape, by being able to run from back to front and lift all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With the high-speed trains, you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires by a plane including the climb three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology return to car and horse.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what secrets were made between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France offers its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called Fast Start or Pre-Fire Finances) that have been implemented by the developing countries.
And the gross French sprekers have already been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have undertaken to make 30 billion dollars available between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners of the fact that their commitments to fixed-start funding are: the detailed report of action of its Member States, press conference, large side-events, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and gradually estimated for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see it if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, bringing it on the right path to respecting its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional efforts have been made, without inadequate the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the guide value he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a guide value for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained, and it will provide 150 million for more than three years in the framework of the 'Fast Start' funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guide values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France felt that the financing of all new projects in 2010 was "new and additional".
Otherwise, there are no guidelines in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In fact, the overall sum of the French support of developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France claims to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed € equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is only hardly reliable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is fraudulent to present the euro that is considered equivalent to a donated euro... and only the costs of the loan for the country of capital should be calculated as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking up 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country of the EU that largely uses loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) meet their commitments to 100% donations.
Otherwise, if the major majority of the European Union spends 1€ in order to fulfil its commitments, France just gives 10 cents and understood a similar use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start funding with a double dizziness: to one part with a further development of the action over time and, secondly, with the reality of financial operation.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who performed the Arbitrage) could lead to a double negative effect; once EU-internal (which is why the other Member States continue to donate if it is enough to borrow?) and then in negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question in relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on the climate.
But there could be too much drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of booking for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward the discussions on the issue of long-term funding (a different, crucial and currently discussed topic): the question of "responsibility" or the type of booking of his loans is not found.
France could change its position to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will come to Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "responsibility" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international confidence basis which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticide taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a study published this Wednesday by the Genération Futures Association (hemal movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that their results "have not reflected statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but represents illustration character of the problematics treated," had usually bought foods from July to September between July and September within four, which were consumed by a about ten-year-old child at meals plus an intermediate meal time in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as nashores of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance is degrading: 81 chemical substances, including 42 considered possibly or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carciogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine interference factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for any chemical, individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the nearby overall cases, this survey is very well taken into account that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to endocrine disturbance substances or substances," the association notes.
Already on breakfast, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely shown as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apples imported from Brazil, for the purpose of meals for the study, show traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study identified traces of strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
Also, the hacking steak, the tuna from the bucket, even the baguette and the chew rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were sprinkled.
The analysis of nitrates and chloroforms has revealed the presence of the lead water.
At dinner the lax steak with 34 detected chemical residues was the "richest" and even the plastic counter used for heating the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "business cocktail" for the consumer is probably "underestimated", says the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed, on its part, "in view of the urgent situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increasing in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
