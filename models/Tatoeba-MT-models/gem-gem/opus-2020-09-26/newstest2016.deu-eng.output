Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as on the destabilising measures of Teheran in the Middle East.
However, it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the continuing settlement construction of Israel and proposes Netanyahu a lack of will in the peace process.
Through the deal acquired by Obama on the Iranian nuclear programme, the relationship between the two has further deteriorated.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech, which was partly considered a distortion against Obama at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress.
The talk was not agreed to Obama, a meeting had rejected it with reference to the future election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and likely excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note criticized on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me." This was, according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no evidence that Lamb, in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school site, where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Manager Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the devastating emergency call afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police turned him in.
One day after the shooting at the university, students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get an image of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the researchers at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his class.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both instructed in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time there were some inclinations to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a permit for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion for which lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to work as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police found Lamb's track later when he entered again in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the back of a house about a mile south of his parent house at the edge of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It was not immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education.
He promoted in the spring in pedagogics.
One of Lamb's long-year-old friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when she met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for a few years.
He was the woman's worm at the time.
When he was there, all the girls were smelting there," said Hairston, now 40 and lived in the Jackson town of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were evidently together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein House, which bounded to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was completely destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer year market three years ago.
Later they played the one or other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and singes her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonic game before a spherical audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Simply a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and shouting with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense for jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American inhabitants and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community attended a Christmas Memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the Mahnwake while the University of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace sang.
The lesson will be restarted on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call Prentiss called his wife, but there is no evidence that the two have ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set up less workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to set up 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country. At Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were still set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will begin in this month with application conversations and the number of employees rises from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide stores with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox shouts about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a coming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film starts, and I'm thinking that I'm a simulated gum and a arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had 30 years ago premiere.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "inconsistent with the biggest time travel movie ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chef again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member States of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France - at the border of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unresolvable."
Ban invited the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria, which they have proved in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have lost him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper rings in surveys, it has not (now) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed that Donald Trump leads in the two-digit field, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of the property moguls.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain at this time, and no one won only one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general choice.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps persistence and begin to let their dollars flow to crash him.
Here are some of the current survey values which indicate that the real estate mogul is not only a temporary phase:
Trumps popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey by the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
Until mid-July, there were 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Some three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP picker GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be either "begious" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of ten say they'd be "arrogated" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "excited" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next one in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the Establishment, the candidate, would be "unsatisfied" or "abushed".
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trumps temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of the Irish tenders who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-elected state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their scholarships, Republican voters think Trump is real.
If they are asked who wins the GOP nomination most, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week four out of ten says that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time four out of ten July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP choosers did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Yet, a wide range of GOP choosers view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still strikes almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the divided field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership while the anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetic head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority of support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-to-head race.
A few majority of Donald Trump fans say they've made their opinions.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly forgiven their voices.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trumps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other outsiders, the neuro surgeon Ben Carson, but choosers who say they have formed their opinions are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico two months ago in his election peace, the immigration was turning and fishing point in public discourse in 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic expression of Trump decisive Hispano Americans will stay away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration remains in the candle, it seems to be Donald Trump.
The frustration about the government climbs to new highest levels.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters now, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry with Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republics are frustrated by the Republicans at the convention, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "healtically angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive housing system is located here on the Hobooken Road - with views over the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square metre of a railroad house costs at an average of EUR 73.300.
"The offer of objects is naturally limited to Sylt," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special layers a square meter is most expensive.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's top places, one of the prices appears to be like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in dizzy heights.
There are several ten thousand euros not - per square meter, well noticed.
But well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is here exceptionally not at the top.
Champions League: Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Gothze
Two-fold door shooter in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then ran it.
A sophisticated uptake of the Champions-League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the Piräus witch.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won their play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers doublepack (52./90.+2) and Goths hits (89.) with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelve startup success in series is supposed to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
During his 28th meeting in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership, Müller received good help from Olympiakos Torwart Roberto, who let one pass as a flank thoughts shot of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," promised Bayern captain Philipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadion before 31 688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munks kept words.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without shining.
Piräus had won his last six home games in the king class, including against prominent clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund was also stumbling.
But the Bayers, in seven Europecup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously ran, but often too insanely in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were launched too often by play shifting to the left outside Douglas Costa, which rarely came through against the former Braunschweeper Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank from the right half field in the upper left torak.
In the 67th minute, the world champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos Stormer Ideye Brown hit the Poland headball (26.).
Then by direct deduction, the Torwart Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bayers used to raise her dominant game, Piräus was able to put the needle stick.
On Torhüter Manuel Neuer, however, was trusted.
For example, when he lent a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56.).
Before Newer, Guardiola had a four chain with David Alaba in the center of Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the box, first sat outside.
The WM hell gave green light only after graduation, said the sports board of Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else from it, this is already evil."
Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the defeated Lewandowski (59.)
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, with an elf-meter swabbler put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to Krawalls in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially embarked Bayern fans in their viewer block, apparently provoked the adherents of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and took actions against the Munch Attachers.
At least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
If you smoke, it hurts not only the lungs but also the teeth - that is a long-term Potsdamer study.
The good news: If the risk is rejected, the risk falls quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is seen from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth in advance was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are the carries and inflammations of the tooth meat, the DIfE emphasizes.
Smoking is a risk factor for this parodontitis, the authors stress.
The connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore due to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear that smoking also increases the risk of cars.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risks within a short time, the researchers write in "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years until the hazards fall back to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham.
One must convince people to become non-smoking, study leader Heiner Boeing of the DIfE explained: "Smoking reduces lifetime."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health up to high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by dental insomnia, DIfE reported.
Previous investigations had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists hit Kölner Rheinufer on remnants from the late
For repeated times, Rheinufer has been made on the right in Cologne archaeological foundations.
Near the building site for the new Rhineboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman German Museum's Skelette and the rest of historic buildings, said Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the building at the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called soil monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always accompanied as an expert office for archaeological grounddenkmal care.
In the third section of the Rhineboulevard, archaeologists now became fine.
Text documents have already been known that in the 4th century instead a fortress and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
Besides the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young Woman of Goods Traveled
After a young woman is accidental at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asks the people for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1:40 a.m., the woman crossed the railway railway building at the end of the railway railway and was captured by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
By taking the train, it has, according to the Federal Police, brought the most serious injuries of it.
She was treated locally and brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
The detective officials have no knowledge of the reason for the night's crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or inhabitants have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiry is made by residents or passengers from Linderner Railways, Tegelsäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Instructions on the cause of the accident can be given on a free and switched hotline of the Federal Police on the phone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
The EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute about TTIP
In order to intensify the dispute about the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitrary arbitration system.
The controversial private explanatory bodies for disputes between Groups and States are therefore to be resolved by a more transparent system which is significantly more consistent with traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," explained EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the idea.
The Swiss intends to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is intended to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current arbitration procedures specifically provide that the EU States and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are intended to come from the same parts of the EU, the USA and third countries.
For the first time, it is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties concerned agreed on arbitrators, and there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
For example, there could also be clarification of disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
The Investor State Proceedings (ISDS) demanded mainly by large companies are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a type of parallel justice, through which companies can take the taxpayers to the first place, lift national laws or apply a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TIP organisations such as Campact referred to the proposals of the EU Commission as insufficient.
It was criticised mainly that they should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as a major progress.
The Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Federal Economic Ministry Sigmar Gabriel prepared with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European Company Association BusinessEurope warned against restricting economic appeals through too many new rules.
In particular small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the discussions on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, the Wednesday remained unclear.
The negotiations have taken place since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States until now.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should already be set at the end of this year.
This date is deemed to be no longer durable.
Delicates People von Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago Sufjan Stevens is sitting on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Besides him, there is a flipchart on which the shy people's singers recorded the picturesque U.S. state Michigan with Filzstift.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens' lecture.
He tells by means of various places, which he always signs on the map, about which his minusious and tenderly arranged songs are reported.
Where they came from and what it looks like there in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative wrongdoer.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" it appears smartly composed songs, which can squeeze very close to American people of the late sixties, but at any time operate into the great opulent.
It arose the reputation that "Michigan" would be the first part of a distorted series: each of the 50 US states should be sang in a sequence.
However, in 2004 and in Rheinnahe, "Seven Swans" have already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live enough guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returned to the series.
"Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") appears in 2005 a surface-decked masterpiece.
Override of ideas and stylistic fitness.
The album rises into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any of the annual records of influential music media.
After excessively productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic shiftpieces.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestrad, but wore by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
At the end of the smaller clubs, the stage shows are here to be a colorful spectacle from Neon core bands and large fluorescent stage deco.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens travels through Germany as part of a five-head band.
In the dark kept Hamburger Mer!
Theatre is mainly presented with the available "Carrie & Lowell" since March.
Although nearly 2000 guests are now bound in their chairs, the more mature Stevens return to intimity and people.
Without addressing the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus throw away the "platte in essence".
Stevens only thanks modestly, plays acousticly few older songs, and eventually deviates themselves under an applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's Debüt at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns Debüt has been expected with tension at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
The new Labour Chairman, Jeremy Corbyn, is supposed to give his debt at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six proposed questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely by the media and the Labour Departments from nearby will be examined.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them over to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because after his appointment it will come to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman, to persevere on Tuesday during the singing of the national hymn at a Memorial on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism by a number of Tory-MPs and is at the center of several title pages story in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has drawn attention to himself
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had "standing in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Helem of the Royal Air Force in the Air Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinett, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymn "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be disappeared.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they call on differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacks" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith said that the Shadow Ministry of Labour and Pension that the Party is "very clear" that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman, who, since he was Tory Chef, has faced the dispatch box in Parliament in the last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is too confrontative and that he is being abandoned both "simplity" and fighting with reverses and instead has decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow of economic minister, will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the underhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the policy in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", which is often linked to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he failed.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the underhouse and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed extensive reforms.
'Shots in Joburg': homeless young people trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a hard place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn living.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a commonly useful studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pounds rise jumpingly after data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. Parallelly, FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller command target.
Between May and July, the result grew by 2.9 % without bonuses in the United Kingdom compared to the same previous period.
This percentage has been the fastest and has been estimated on the date of an increase in interest since 2009.
The pounds increased by more than 1% compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and were climbed up to 0.84% compared with the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index ended with an increase by 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the acquisition of the Rivalen AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures strike all expectations and also showed that the turnover in China - a key market for Burberry - is again announced growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining grease said he had taken $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his assessment of the company Rating on "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company had reported a pre- tax result of 46.6 million for the half of the year.
The manager of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion.
The manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchase power in the bags of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing force will compensate for the higher costs of his company, he says.
The costs could take the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, which could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
lip 21 years young, a henfling with over-sweet hair.
The guy with the platin-blown hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Better even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the generation U17 is turning through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
These include Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7:00 a.m. the poles sit on the cold stone plates form Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber building: Here you live Idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs just as much on the day as their mom Ewa deserves in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "In fact, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
School obligation?
Who is it?
No fans.
Neither beeber himself.
He's got it anyway.
For the advertising in the advertising break of the Superbowl, he washed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle company washed many, many dollars on the beeber account.
And at every pop that looks like it and goes over the shop table, beeber is also cassing.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're surprised at the window disc.
More than 100 million are supposed to have spent that way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Bieber itself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does that.
Pegida Plakat brings Libaneses to potato fields-idee
Potatoes or Danes?
It goes both - and in the potato fields that the Oldenburger Imbis owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the word "Cartoffel instead of Daner" on a poster of the Pegida movement Alhay potatoes and meat put together on a spit.
On the idea, a poster brought him at a Pegida demonstration with the label "Cartoffels instead of Danes", which he randomly had seen on TV.
Since then, in his shop, a grill spoiled with meat and potatoes is rotated.
"This is multicultural for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Libanese patent office in Munich.
It has been protected there, according to the Authority's information, as a pattern of use.
So how much meat and how much potatoes of the spear contain, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary consensus is also good for its customers.
Metcash starts soil stability campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA movies from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-gross dealer Metcash has launched a soil stability campaign to defend the market share of the IGA individual dealers in South Australia and Western Australia in front of a 700 million dollars aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events as Adelaide shows.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like ice manufacturers Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners selling approved tickets for the South Australian footballliga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of his defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment is carrying out its annual investor strategy day.
It's a lot at stake, since South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA charges and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorically provinceal and IGA dealers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analytists like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after opening its first markets, Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors, but mainly self-dealed retailers.
According to a report published this week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers could lose $360 million turnover per year and metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Metcash's high fixed cost base, Metcash could cost about $13 million profits before interests and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's turnover in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, with 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will decrease the market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business girl in Melbourne that Metcash probably will disappear within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides approximately 1,200 IGA dealers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt debt debt decline at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the gross dealer will avoid and invest more than $150 million to improve sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to bring up IGA dealers in improving their shops through faster growing fresh food and a better selection of private labelling foods.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop recovery programmes will be made to Elan and hopes that the wholesale dealer will return to a growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, earns more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is always called "Special Ks", came into the calamity of the repentant dispute of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, where Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen knocking a tennis striker after a seizure of a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth, for the second place in particular behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup Halffinale against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm quite inherited about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little in the struggle," said Healy.
He broke a struggle when he lost a seizure in the US-Open, but he is not the first player who broke a struggle from frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has acted extremely well in the US-Open, even under the quite provokative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is well in form, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged after his own earnings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kirgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for all, but he ensures that the man from Canberra is returning to the team as a long-term firm component."
"First we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has made the rise very quickly, which people like springs and Murray have pointed to. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understandable the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the candle light, in which he can only think about it, I think it's appropriate, and it's the best for the crew and it's the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country. Everything in order to stop the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-country and Serbian officials responded with angryness.
The people who fled from violence were stuck and built tents between the two control points of the countries and stayed there for an unknown time.
But frustration increased.
When a police hub screw over them, the migrants scanned "Open the border!" and cried offenses against the Hungarian willing police.
Some showed back from protest food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister declared that it is "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Conversations must be held with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulencies at the Hungarian-Serbian border arrived one day after the 28-National block at a controversial meeting in Brussels, no common immigration policy could be agreed.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility of 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the overthrown Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, at the end of the next month or by the end of the year, a agreement would be reached that the EU States would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not hope for a rapid action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency issued on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis so that they could lock up roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
In the meantime, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto said that his country also plans to build a stachel wire tune along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the stake wire tune between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a significant entrance and a starting point in the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damage to the 4-meter (13 feet) high tower that the government has built along the southern border to Serbia, a crime. These laws also establish higher penalties for condemned human merchants.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the emergency state," said government speaker Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border transition is a crime.
The European Parliament must still, on a technical basis, agree with the use of the military which is expected for next week, but reporters from Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Advisor for Orban, said that governments had reached 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already been deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police guard and are accused of committing crimes in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are working to fix the door quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border transitions with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train carrier with stachel wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border transition near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push into it.
Some 20 succeeded, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia and Hungary's most important motorway connection and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's advance before Bernie Sanders in national survey halved
The former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advance in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins on the ground.
Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-options (58 percent before), while Sanders is second place, with 27 percent (increased by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he candidates for the Presidential Office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic elections.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-options, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined what candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more constant in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained some profits.
Clinton holds a great precipitation in women and moderates, but these premises have decreased.
Their support for the men has declined significantly, and Sanders is just back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has fled, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, has a great precipitation in the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was with two-digit predominant in front of Sanders, but Sanders now has a 5-point predecession with this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections throughout the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporter is particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would be enthusiastic to support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporter is asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most frequent answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman becomes President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and electability is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the Presidential Office into the scale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, praying is at the top.
About Clinton's followers, more than half say that bids would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to announce the nomination of the democratics, Hillary Clinton's advance before Sanders rises from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the choice, but this number has decreased by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a second with distance at this measurement, but the percentage that views it as the most "choosable" has increased.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important to a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the choice.
Like last month, no one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electoral voters is unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features of choosers of the pre-elections of their party.
Most view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong management quality.
Being cuts the best off with the three candidates in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion about it.
In general, democratic voters of the pre-elections also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked as Minister for Foreign Affairs during the term of office, most democratic elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions at all.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on Clinton's general opinions, although 36 percent said that her opinion had still worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them under registered voters in total: only 32 percent view them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the elected people across the country also view Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes in leadership.
From the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off with honesty.
A majority views Sanders rather than honestly, but as with Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre-options is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is coming up in a country-wide survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates are now the half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others lose dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in a large number across the country. The support grows from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was carried out before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the survey of Tuesday.
But Carson shot to 23% in the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson is good at demographic groups and overcomes Trump among Republican voters with university education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio governor John Kasich, has been dismissed with Wisconsins Guvernor Scott Walker, who has fallen deepest, from 10% support in the last month to now 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are located on the third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons by Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey that was published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - he arrives at 19% support for the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side hectares for the former neuro surgeons, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to up to 29 degrees.
Even if top values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for bathers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or East Sea is expected to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer in the sea: maximum 18 degrees of water in the North and East Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: even in the east it reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adria, it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the brotherhood are burdened with the death of a Baruch College-Neuling
Almost two years after a student died during a schikanous ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, mortal charges are submitted against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood, Chun "Michael" Deng took brutally on during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officers said that he was loaded with connected eyes with a 30-pounds backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to go through a frozen field to a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches, and then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became unauthorized and said they waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng the national president of the brotherhood to pick up advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point the members began to hide outensils and in principle put the welfare of the brotherhood over that of Michael Deng," said the police chief Wagner.
He couldn't be resurrected, and he died the next morning at his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stubborn force injuries to the head, crumbs, and upper necks.
"Too many families were destroyed by the Schicans of the Brotherhood. At least one student dies in the Schicans every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in an explanation.
Brotherhoods and their members must be made accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder's third degrees for the first five members.
Thirty-thirty members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of slim attacks and the creation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to make the people involved responsible, but if there is a organization - officially or unofficially - that sanctioned this, we will also make them accountable," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest
A rate increase comes, and the houses will be lost, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will go into a recession.
We know.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history offers little guidance for the economy to the expiry.
A recession came within 11 months of the first rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial facilities respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start to increase the interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants could find that the entire excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest.
"The first increase in the fed since the global financial crisis is unavoidably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "billy money", said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the slow return of the US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the preliminary of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that assets are devested 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the rate increases of the Fed.
Exactly, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the rising trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, quite flat in the 250 days afterwards (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, Chef Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The German Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the case of an increase in interest rates.
According to the Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only below 4.5 per cent of the nominal GDP twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such fragile economic scenes could be risky and raise the question "whether it is different this time," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have been engaged in an increase in the interest rate throughout the year, and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many streets and economists believe that the FOMC could authorise an increase at this meeting, the future trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all the increase cycles took place in a super cycle from 1950 to today, with increasing turning at GDP, and very quickly placed pre-recession heights after the start of restoration," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market advances interest increases and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond ends fall immediately, said the German Bank.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse of yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflection of the curve.
High-rente bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyzer at Schwab in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter money policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, profit curve is smoother, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed reinforces its strategy.
Overall, companies who take the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from the increase in interest rates and the attractiveness of local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increase in dollars make their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to respond very positively three months after a initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance have, after each of the rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, exceeded an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pensions by average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percent points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollars.
Sparers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts are different from the opinion of how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter for his "condemnation"
He argues that he is increasingly not to distinguish from commercial rivalries.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament-Kollege Damien Collins attacked the mission The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "switchs" into Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the Private Sender does not.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC boss that the public-law radio broadcaster should be "foolish" and increasingly distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "condemn" - but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year appear to be only under another name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you are actually just imitating what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn about classic music anywhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is really inconvenient.
"And finding the commitment of Radio 3, new music and commissioning new works, I also really think important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that harder work should be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was, however, not the only element of BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports to take up commercial rivalries.
The Tory-delegated Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "in special BBC-wise".
He added that he wishes that the company "finds a hit out of our own stall" when it starts a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money from the fees payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet turnovers increased the slowest in August and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month, the lowest result has been since the beginning of the records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday broke the expenditure in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been built, and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are signs now that the online turnover stagnates after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales increased three years ago, when buyers began to operate with their cell phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now it's going to get into it, and we may experience that growth decreases.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for delaying sales.
Experts believe that buyers will stop their purchases before this event, each of which will take place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of purchasers to make their computers cut down, and some trader websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fought for slices, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that out of 5 £ expenditure was a little more than 1 £ online.
For some products such as television and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried those killed in Mekka at the crane accident - Bin Ladens family is sancted
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia lays the breakdown partly to the huge Saudi bin-load group
The Ministry of Health said that 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane of Mekka’s great mosquee crashed.
Sayers filled, largely dressed in white, the route to chose their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Friedhof.
The mourning procession went through in the Holy Place, where only days before a crane of construction fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the building company of the Bin Laden family due to the disaster, which also left 394 injured ones.
The bodies of 29 beers that were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Moschee Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Moschee.
Saudi officials have already firmly agreed that the Haddsch will continue to Mekka with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the bin load group shouldn't have left the crane's arm when it was not used.
A Arab version of the decree published by the state of Saudi Press Agency said that the bin load group was responsible for the breakdown.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of this week, Salman commended to disclose what caused the crash of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Great Moschee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which will take place later this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not issue any statements on the breakdown of Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also declined the group because of non-existing security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surround Mekka's big mosquee as part of the massive construction project led by the bin load group.
The Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was dismissed by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officers said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) should be paid to the victims and the same sum of permanent injuries.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap east-European craftsmen is over
Britain is increasingly employed craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 other screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B&Q sales sites will close across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain put their hammers and brushs in favour of the use of qualified east-European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you are able to handle walls with a hammer or a brush, you seem to be a minority today.
For Britain increasingly employs craftsmen to carry out homeworking jobs in their homes, says the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new manager of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at low prices, has now been overdue.
Therefore, Kingfisher intends to open 200 other screwfix shops that are addressed to craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, since eight out of ten shopping decisions are taken by women.
At the moment, the men weigh over with the staff.
She said it was necessary to set up the growing demographic trends that have more female single households, which are doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British leading company listed in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year profit and sales after the group trained the costs for closing the shops.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officers of Aich/Dob due to unfaithfulness before court
On Wednesday, Klagenfurt had two officials of the Austrian Volleyball-Vizemeister Aich/Dob to be responsible for unfaithfulness and tax restraint.
The accused did not confess.
One of them had also been accused of official abuse.
He was legally released from this objection in May.
The current process has been denied.
According to Supreme State Advocate Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it was outcrystallised that in the years 2006 to 2011 the accuseds used funds of association accounts for which they were allowed to be disposed of in their functions for private purposes.
The injury is amounted to about 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial offences.
This fact excreted the chairman of the shepherdsenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is intended to be negotiated at a later date.
In order to discard the unfaithfulness, the defense stated that at no time the association had a disadvantage of assets.
Athletes had only resolved burdens and the sports club for which they were working from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the liabilities were about 600,000 Schilling in 2001 (R 44,000 euros).
"Then we faced the situation: are we going on or are we locking up the club?" said one of the accused, in the bread profession, major auditors of the financial office.
With his colleague and colleague, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
"We've shot money, put our life insurance as security to the bank," he said when he agreed.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it must not be made debts.
Furthermore, in the event of financial success, the retroactive payment of wage compensations was decided by 1991.
Thus, some of the effort compensations were only paid years later, from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, fixedal and non-detailed bookings also appeared, explained the former Obmann the transactions.
The accounts and spare books managed the two accuseds together, said the second accused.
Why the payments were not detailedly revealed to the association, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the financial arrangement in detail that only debt freedom was important, so the answer.
When a functionary investigation for official abuse began in 2011, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the Conciliation Account.
That would have been a reserve, the defendants declared.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?", wanted the judge to know.
The questioner did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally felt that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The complainant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as a "hazard recovery".
Why damages?, wanted judge and prosecutor to know.
The first accused declared that he had not agreed with this formula because the association had never been damaged.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You are all out of the cutter?"
"I'm a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the functionary said that he had never paid a cent, he just lost kilometers of money and diets.
He took account of 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years were not able to show the accused.
These were no longer stored after an operational test in which everything was considered correct, they explained.
The second prosecutor had also paid miles of money.
All repairs were made in a bar, so he had to drive from his place of residence international market to the bank to blyburg, he explained in his statement.
The main negotiation will continue on 23 September with the consultation of Witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard stretches more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the degradation of staff for three years, the computer series will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job breakdowns at the U.S. computerry Hewlett Packard (HP) will not end.
The U.S. technology group plans to decline from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer pharmacy in the context of its restructuring.
This is intended to save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around $2,7 billion, which will be attacked from the fourth quarter.
The decline of 55.000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed.
At the end of the financial year 2013/14, HP was still employed about 302.000 employees.
The Hewlett Packard share was 2.3 per cent.
The group grown up with printers from California Palo Alto is currently split up: so the computer and printing business is to be connected even more in a new society - separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data stores for companies as well as other services.
Both parts are to be recorded at the stock exchange.
A new disappointing PC paragraph and a weaker demand for its services were last added to the second largest PC manufacturer in the world to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sale of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 per cent.
The turnover fell by 8 per cent to nearly $25.4 billion.
This resulted in a decline in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a splitting and massive strokes to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only reacted lately that customers strengthen smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and make more and more online shops.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee the decline of approximately 5,000 places.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would mainly be a rejection: 54 per cent argued that 35 per cent proved to be in agreement.
That other states fly air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A collaboration with the Syrian power-owner Bashar al-Assad refuses 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for it.
29 percent could not decide.
Auto: Second press day on 66th IAA
The focus of the fair is on networked, self-running cars and electrical mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile exhibition under the motto "Mobility" on Thursday.
The broad audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, VDA's organizers are expected to have around 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Violent outbreak at the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police has placed on the Serbian border with Roszke tear gas and water shields against several hundred refugees.
Euronews Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind it had been a police line, and behind the police a water shield was ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to the officials.
At first, the officials used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn something in awaiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sucked together and suffered breathlessness.
The Serbian police press speakers also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. note bank
The world observes when the US Notenbank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision, whether for the first time the interests are raised for almost a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists, who were consulted by Reuters, found that a little more than half, which was still the opinion last week that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will persist a little longer and the interest rates will hold at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's an historical event because it's seven years ago since the Fed interest set to NULL.
"For the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance and generates only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to set up an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 2 a.m. MEZ
Death Protection at Delta State University left apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before later on the day he shot and killed his colleague - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "condole" to him at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it uneven," the authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a teacher of geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning
He said he shot somebody and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but he'll "nobody disturb," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before eventually took his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb claimed to believe that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday, there is "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He won't go to prison."
When police picked him up at the highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car side, fled to foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated on the University's website.
Stars who lost their lucky ones
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor also claims to be fighting drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug ownership.
All of this certainly requires his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the group
The Lufthansa plans a large company construction.
A half a billion euros a year are trying to save the Airhansa Group alone with a better organisation.
150 of the world's about 1,000 leaders will cost the company's construction workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
The Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and reconsiders Eurowing's cheap daughter.
The aim of re-establishment is a resulting contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and sales synergies, the airline informed the airline on Wednesday.
Among other things, the airhansa will be out of board for the passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings cheap flight line should be developed as independently as possible.
In the management team of Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in future.
With the reconciliation, Smohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group will come up to Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines established under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which is three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC) the negotiations will be restarted after the judicially stopped strike on this Thursday.
That was what the trade unions informed.
The subject of discussions is to be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to find sustainable results as soon as possible "in one year with a forecast record result".
The conflict between trade unions and Airline has led to various strikes in the past months.
The background is the "Wings" concept, besides the transitional supply of pilots.
It is expected that airhansa will be transferring routes to Eurowing's group-cost line in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morgenzug in the South" paintings of Leena Krüger are seen in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions-League degradation of Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defendant to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The injury was caused by an irresponsible attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated at the playground nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very difficult and then plays fantasticly, and then this happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the dressing cabin.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red map and the hanging of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had mistaken.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an elf meter and a red card were dropped.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to healing begins now, I come back stronger."
Concerning this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PSV
The defendant of England has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland's team at the 2014 WM.
"He makes himself very difficult because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you then hear it is a very bad injury, it's not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like he had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely David knows Cameron The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fabel published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps company's website, and continues: "Happy, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read for my children, because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron claims to describe the action of the book, represents a description of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seus's hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this was not suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, hopes to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here a unnamed boy hears the local environment, like the monetary, trees falling, thneed striking one-one-ler, despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a cracking, snorring being, "what speaks in the name of the trees" is destroyed.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A downing street speaker said that the text probably came from Camerons electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by excluding England's crew, but it is still difficult
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude a foreign victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting position, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Report related to this: Adam Lyth is separated from the England Test Catalogue and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to release Adam Lyth is hard for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are oriented to results.
There were no questionnaires at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best choosers.
For a long time ago, Lyth's run had been extended, but he had control of his own fate.
If he hopes he will run out more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The English trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not provide so good services, and that is not surprising to me; he is mainly a team man.
The question of how much time a test killer gets to set his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outside.
The only argument that can be raised was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a beatman I appreciate.
He is a X-Factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which hit us very much.
It must receive at least the same chances as those before it, but this depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen be struck next to Cook, which would bring an extra-Spin-Bowler and receive four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a beatman can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spinner, and in my limited association with him he impressed me very as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - average 31 with the beatman and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the trainer staircase.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games may be a master coup.
He is one of the most nice men of the game, which will bring a lot of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing cabin, even if the news is in line with the previously said.
Colly teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Days, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team agents do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easy of heart.
The Brexit camp (brexit = exit from the EU) could gain access if the economy is in a fluid device by 2017
David Cameron's unprecedented new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will be deeper in trouble with each day, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to be the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is violently devastated because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel fares.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply as the EU is now, are satisfied with split concessions and disturbing contract changes that they do not usually want.
In Brighton, the TUC at its Annual Assembly decided that it would not like it if they threaten social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and Ministers of Finance climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside in the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have come to the point where they care whether we stay or go.
Germany's carefully-minded Chancellor Angela Merkel is a alliance, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overwhelming long enduring such as Thatcher (11 years), middle edge (14) and coal (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also an exciting force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is hard to imagine that they will cut off a leg in order to help the selffie brides whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from coming out of the UK - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist trends.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments, in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The new negotiation was a plague" and "Groß Britain has won nothing of value from the negotiation."
The Europeans know how rubbish the Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU creators are the oligarchy of the press barone, as it was during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro opportunist who made a name as a "EU Straight banana" Brussels Correspondent in the early 90s.
With all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This includes the Medley of tax-frighting-shoes, telephone-hackering foreigners and the Pseudo non-inhabitants, who have most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noted that when you sit in a hot gorilla in a cage, you're better distributed bananas to distract him instead of becoming for his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum spine, because Blair had set the principle of the unaccepted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters, which opened a back door to him in 2005.
The press never forgot him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needs to waste time for me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It can take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe - I would like to express it kindly - is in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional tendency to pure herbs and the wildr folds of Tory's small Englishism, I guess everyone can say yes to that.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennyte" Benn on radio and television this week when the pathfinder struggled in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provoking John McDonnell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour Cabinett colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to remain "in all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, but what JC said to his colleagues and Members after all the reports on their clause meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the touching bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all things in the trouble of social media, a gross place of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe, which allows him to think Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a naturality, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins probably thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental multi-definitions of EU membership - in line with their delightful surveillance economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for which the narcissm of the small difference is a key principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his multidefinities about Nato - Tom Watson, it is absolutely convinced that JC will not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their managers at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start of Monday of something called British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the report by Public Health England on E cigarettes
According to a state-financed agency, e-cigarets are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, partly linked to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PhE) in their report on e-cigarets.
PHE published the "constitutional report" last month and describes it as a "wide review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the loadability of data and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A leading article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "exceptionally windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the best estimate at present is that E cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to lead to a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to develop their opinions on the damages of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose manager was supposed to have received previously from British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funds from an E-Cigarette Manufacturer, but not the funding he was supposed to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International before reports, they added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the body are not provided, but there are several known e-cigarets champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The tobacco leadership of PHE was also attended at the meeting.
The research work of the group "represents significantly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence that E cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smoking" were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been reacted before.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies in his abuse.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of E cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence and what is not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die every year of a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarets are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivalries "will give your right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, probably seen by a smaller audience, in hardly controversial times against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 he had tried to get into contact with the BBC without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC will provide or send programmes that would also be clearly shown by non-subsidy rivalries," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communications Committee in his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to hold the broadcast fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programmes that do not make or commit others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach a widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course crazy.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, of course, both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was debt in the hunt for reviews "for the ambitions of people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular broadcasts of the BBC reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-law nisch programs should "go to BBC4 where the audience can't measure, but they can fulfil their tasks, and they can argue if they go to their chocolate missions to justify 4 billion £ round-line fees, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscured programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this.
Of course, all of you think, we all think that you get a big value for 150 £ per year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £, ask me if that is true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky- und Kanal 5-Chef David Elstein, who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday, asked the BBC to examine its Reithian mission to "inform, form and entertain".
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and it should take an example to the public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to "inform, inform and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms of which he said that only one handful is shown on television, and enter with the commercial broadcasters Alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction at the moment in which they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
The small nematods change the direction in the moment they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequency for human listening to be heard.
The impulses work by enabling Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasonic can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Fadenworms usually do not respond to ultrasonic, but Chalasani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasonic waves, which then run into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves have the effect of opening these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a Nature Communications report.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurone TRP-4 ion channels were wearing.
When it uses ultrasonic on the modified creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the microblases and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a trackbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn down and off neurons with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages toward this technology.
Unlike light that must be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber, low frequency ulk waves can be unhindered and can thus be shipped into the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your door!
The ads shame the UK's weapons trade
View Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen Video.
Horrible murderer drones!
Foot legs crushing legs!
The scratch bomb!
And electro-scocking staves that cause pain, but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and cartoon pictures make no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapons fair is a fighter parodie produced by Amnesty International to distinguish the willingness of the British Government to scatter weapons to repressive regimes on the defence and security equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Dockland.
Family: DSEI Arms Messe: Authoritarian regimes stream to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second view.
"Important announcement: Do you drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the types of London Underground and the mark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September a sword of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 plates are from artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for Wrathful Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ package of inbus keys, claiming that "accession to about a third of the bus stop site advertising areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parodie displays produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of gallery.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art may have an influence on society.
Another of the anti-wave trading pactates greet the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the VCCP advertising agency, who works commonly with the graphics and voiceover artists, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms fair - through an empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Give them the campaign that they try to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic business advertising, but "through flowering with bright colors and animation it remains more liable."
"You have done a fantastic job by helping us to sharpen our consciousness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an entry from the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded before our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are fantasticly euphemist products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a order of the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS RS shot off from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped fighting crew that delivers outstanding consequences within the target."
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a 19-year-old self-forgotten, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the excited smiles of those I have been angry - and the many long- breathing complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distillated into eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes is enough from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to sweat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you took a Sabbath year, where you stand about Corbyn and why you "honestly say you don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, boys, it's just a hefe extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It leads the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your wimpers were burning and these fires were fired.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drink recipes, movie night events places and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress themselves and rear their underwear.
Concerning this: Do not think of starting the university with a relationship
Introverts receive a gross treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many student homes form a room-to-room cottage culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so that I can get back the energy I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commission is exhausted from sociality - and send him a SMS instead of knocking.
Apropos banking: do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the college at the peak of the back manie, knocking at the doors of people to introduce itself with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have backed you something. So, and please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade leakers is a good way to close friendships.
Your fellow inhabitants feel obliged to entertain themselves and may at the end associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed chunks of flour, sugar and fat leads people to sleeping when you knock.
Steeling food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, clawing of chickens is a steal, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you have my compassion - but try to handle it more balanced than my fellow inhabitant, who added her milk a dishwasher to punish thiefs.
She's in jail now.
You shouldn't make noise that stops people from sleeping or working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that you are in the true sense of the word among the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my walk asked her neighbors if they cared about making Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even harder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly left her neighbors sleeping two more hours before she had her own music recorded, closed her door and went to her three-hour trial.
Would it not be romantic if your future mate would accidentally move into the same student home?
In turn, wouldn't it be embarrassing if you held a fellow inhabitant for your future mate, contacted her, separated, then seeed every day, and perhaps experienced how she moves all the common friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow inhabitant is definitely not your future mate, try at least to invoke your substance a bit of reason.
In the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the border between a wolk and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a bumerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never devour any room with dental pasta and shampoo.
Close your door, and put your keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but thank you not more than twice.
Sequence houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate owner Markus Gildner builds houses for people with little money in the Middle-France Eckental.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need a living room, but also the nursing mother and the low earner."
"I show how to build well and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will press into the apartment market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly a cheap living room can be created: He builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will press into the apartment market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or turn halls has no sustainability.
Because people remain here for a large part.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need enough living space in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-sized row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different if you stay people in living blocks.
Each of the six houses just built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each four asylum applicants.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living area per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overlookable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I've been right through my project.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damokles-square special construction and the place-of-the-place regulation.
It's horrible.
It is still understood who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three places.
Only in the cities, there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum candidates have no cars.
How have the inhabitants responded to their row house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum candidates.
What definitely is not true.
But don't you reinforce the competition for payable apartments?
Gildner: True is: We have had a construction tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built, which can hardly afford more.
My project has the message, including normal people need living room.
Not only refugees, but also the nursing mother or the low earner.
I show how to build well and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro-system technology in Regensburg and first focused on environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have come up with problems after installing because they receive an error message that announces that the "software update failed" has failed.
To overcome the problem, users are recommended to wait until the crash goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by deleting the update. It will also be easier to do so if you use a special tool, delete apps and then reinstall them as soon as the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is close to a charger, so the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to be continued, as the phone may disabled halfway and this could result in an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only Decree: Fulle Attacke
Nico Rosberg knows only one decree in the fight for the WM title in the formula 1 against his clear leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton: "Volle Attacke".
The WM second emphasized before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defendant and two-fold Champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous twelve season races and also attacks the flood light-grand-prix in the city state as a favorite.
2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will affect the great price of Singapore, it is still unclear.
For days a thirsty glock has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chechclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has taken another member into his series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen for the cure.
Gauselmann is a carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1. class and honored citizens of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein took.
In this way it is possible to record chess players who cannot pay the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent seeking are also to be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" should be seen as an expression of his bond with the city of Kur.
Quarters Office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Old Century Antonistift have joined under the coat of social foundation and opened a new tour at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
Exactly on the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, receives immediately older and advisory information on questions such as care insurance or services from the nursing and care providers.
For years, with our medical care service, we have found that often plowing family members are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Not rarely many services are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly yet understood," explained the new houselord Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonystift, the Civil Hospital, and for the Amadeus Office.
In addition to the discussions, the new quarter office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The saludis was taken into the boat for this purpose.
It is therefore possible to use additional offers such as disrupt prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are perfectly complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care," Heike Riedel, director of Saludis, explained.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre, both managers see particularly in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined the indication celebrities, the quarter office also dedicated itself to the gathering at age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and they are inviting them to a regular joint meeting."
So the social foundation contributes greatly that seniors can live as self-employed as well as well as well as well as well as in their trusted environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Saturday from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: After resettlement work at the Fuchspark Stadium of the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-party Würzburger Kickers was not yet established, the 6th October was now set as a date.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg at the eighthfinale of the Bayerian football Totopokal against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally ended.
It will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 19 p.m. in the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are happy that we now know when the game goes over the stage, now we have planning security," says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hemmmer, which also points to the now started card pre-sale.
It's special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for numerous viewers, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special excitement.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg 2010 entered by victory at the district Ligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional Ligists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Association Pocal 2016/2017.
Title Defendant is a third-party SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92 years
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the artist house told on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna," as it was called in the broadcasting.
In 1922, Mang was born in Vienna during and after the Second World War Architecture at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952, he worked as a free-created architect, but also as a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the restructuring of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian Theater Museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese shops police with money
Ex-Footballer Tim Wiese has noted in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, former nationaltor guardian in Germany and engaged in Bremen and Hopenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have added, according to his own statement in the past two years.
He did not add intellectually.
Wiese was able to cut the hair just in the inner town of Bremer when he saw how a parking guard issued a penalty certificate for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wise then stormed out of the business, insulted the officer and threw her the penalty in front of her feet, as the "Photo" destruction reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the accusations, but the consequences of the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that, it will be decided whether weave is displayed, or not.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-type climate of the Isla del Rey are best suitable for the breeding of the marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama's authorities have screwed out the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men beat on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the groups, a 17-year-old Afghane, followed his two friends, according to the police, at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft tank.
On the ground of the tank station, three people also stayed.
One of these men now shouted to the young people and struck this with the fist in the face.
The victim suffered a nose fracture and bleeded strongly out of the nose.
When his two friends hurried and argued to the battler, he left his victim at first.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The transgressor followed the group with a car to their apartment and drove demonstratively by there.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the killer and another male person.
With the help of a strike, the victim’s face and upper cup were beaten.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only one vacuum deceit description.
One of the men was about 1,80 meters tall.
The second struggler was supposed to have been about 1,65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and advisors to report under the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also a pleasure for Samtgemeindeburger Meister Bernd Bormann, economic promotor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places of the country, doctors are missing - Asendorf has luck: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on October 1st.
While Ursel Felstehausen goes to retirement, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller opens the practice again on 12 October, until then he invests 310000 euros in the rooms at the St. Marcellus Road 6.
It was sympathy at first view when the Felstehausens years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who are currently graduating their medical training in the world hospital and wants to go into practice next year.
"We always had in the backhead that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was so far, I just called her."
The couple of Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in Asendorf in future.
"The closeness and constant contact with patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
He also sees the advantage of being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There Frank Müller has also grown up twice, his medical study in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently serving as a chief doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was ordered as a leading emergency doctor in the Diepholz Circle and is engaged in the DRK's work in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice is prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to sit down as house doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic examinations as well as long-term and burden EKGs and need a speaking room more.
In addition, the EDV is fully renewed.
A total subsidy of EUR 50000 will be granted to the Müller in the context of a support programme by the district (EUR 25000) and by the assembly (EUR 12500) and the municipality (EUR 12500).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued," stresses Samtgenburger Master Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gondoll, some 2,000 patients come into practice Felstehausen every quarter, in the North German average practice, there are about 500.
There is another house doctoral practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practice acquisition by Frank Müller: The pharmaceutical remains, according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had found her, she would have gone.
Moreover, those visiting Müller's speaking hours continue to look mainly in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning force of the rock houses.
With their divorce, an era ends in Asendorf, the doctors have been practising there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls smeltingly.
A little sorrow after a long time, she feels.
"But we are still living in Hohenmoor and will probably see many patients still often," says the internist.
Her husband supplements laughing: "We have a 6000 quadratmeter foundation."
"Bisher, I always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and is happy to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now border controls are also going up at our southern border," said Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border continue to be maintained parallelly.
Still be clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum request can make this "self-understandable".
The supply and safety of human beings are in the forefront.
Of course, "that it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously notified, also Slovenia wanted to allow refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany, and may also create corridors for refugees.
This is how Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, has already been strongly controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenian is not going to lock its limits on refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government noted, the first refugees had tried to pass by the border cross to Tovarnik/Sid in the evening hours of Tuesday to travel to Eastern Croatia in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police was able to catch them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, in the Croatian Tovarnic, police vehicles have been constantly encountered with new refugees since then.
It concerns mainly Syrians and Afghanes, including many women and children.
Also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country is calculated with about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reporting Croatia and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade contradicts that it is to instruct people to take certain routes: "We can't, we don't want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, at least in the early time a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid, more buses would be expected in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the some 500 kilometers of the Macedonian border.
"We have heard that Hungary has made up, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
In fact, the displacement of the previously routine Turkey-Greece-Mazedonia-Serbia-Serbia-Ungarn, already predicted by observers, could come to a somewhat further western route.
Croatia: "Maying possibilities for border control"
Croatian Inner Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong flow of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-present member, has "transparent options for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have been making a good witness to the country since then, as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border town.
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent last night at the crossing of Horgos, leading to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border transitions of Horgo and Backi Breg continue to remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning in Horgos: he believes that the debate on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers Recommend migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are registered by Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, mining fields still not cleaned.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mining rooms was sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainers pay 30 million dollars
Supranok is supposed to have been part of a ring of cyber criminals who have been prompted to have been able to see still unpubliced financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information provided is supposed to have made insider businesses on the financial markets.
In this way, researchers have been exhausted over $100 million as a whole.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accuseds took place in the case.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
They are supposed to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospital Assistance Manheim exists for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer parade park, there is a regular operation.
People do their concerns, partly fast steps, partially cozy.
They operate the two stations of Mannheimer Autosalon at the parade square.
Hold city trains.
Pulsating, praling life at a glorious autumn sunlight and in the middle of four large tables each with the headline "Before I die"....
The Ecumenian Hospital Assistance made this action aware of its 20-year-old existence and is clearly confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we've been taking the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenian Hospital Assistance is available to the passengers for questions and discussions as well as for the official staff.
While some passports suddenly hit the crawl and the sentence of "yes my life," "can read", "go through the camper", "stop the war" or "not suffer" supplemented, others remain short, read, say sentences like "so far I am not yet" and then continue.
Again and again, there are small discussions about the action in itself, about life, dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that the end of this world will come to me at some point, I can live responsible," says the Director of the Diaconic Work Mannheim, which is co-operating with the Caritas Association of Ecumenian Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this publicly effective action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, but it is understandable, eventually it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and death is still held with Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lammer, although just the hospital movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of humans.
An appreciation that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and grief companion is one of the first hour's official staff.
With personal experience confronted with the topic, she read much literature and decided to want to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenian Hospital Assistance called for Honorary officials, it immediately reported and was present at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the subject and family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and hospitals in Saint Vincent.
They're all thoroughly trained.
Angelika Godefroid can well handle her task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenic Hospital Service is free of charge and independent on confession.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of family and associations enables training as well as training and supervisions of the death and grief companions.
Every two years training for new collaborators is offered.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
More personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, financial perspectives for 2016 lowered
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant reduced his profit view to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his soil transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire some 5,000 seasonal workers for vacation.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends in the next May, 20 cent less than in the previous prediction.
Analytists expected a survey of FactSet $10.84.
In spite of the price increases averaged 4,9 percent and effective on 4 January and in spite of higher supplements for soil transport from heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that, however, it is expected that the result from the previous year will increase due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than those of the Rival UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95.000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to $2,42 per share, just behind the $2,44 per share, who foretold twelve of Zacks Investment Research analysts.
The turnover increased by 5 percent to 12.3 billion dollars.
Six of Zacks interviewed analytists expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has had a decline in international Priority Shipping, which brought the turnover in his unit Express shipping to stagnate.
But the tree in the online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 per cent in soil transport, but the operational result was essentially flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the cargo business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June.
At its most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Straten spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the headline for the first time for almost a decade.
Threating over them at the end of the decorated two-stage meeting room is a wall picture of the United States.
The map reminds us that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold contract from the Congress: keep the maximisation of US employment and prices here stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed Führers have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it. On Thursday, it is announced whether the US economy is ready to get rid of the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate nearly zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that they grow solidly, the latest turbulencies in global financial markets could make the precautious Fed representatives worried to reinforce this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal loans - and whether it is only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Certainly the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefeconomin at the Makler Company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased insecurity around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself insurs the financial market.
Some half of the economists recently consulted by Bloomberg have predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect awaiting the Fed, with a key indicator that indicates only a 30% chance of increase.
This indicates a decline in the share market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the streets defeat the stroke by promiseing that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed Policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chef-conomer at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "it must go very far in her statement to reassure the financial markets so that they don't get panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Another month ago, the Fed seemed to be a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that, despite the complaints by Liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the sentence this year.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
Unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the Fed considers to be full employment.
Labour increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets all over the world collapseed at the end of the last month after China had revaluated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% under its highest level in May when investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would disturb global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, while the Dow is now nearly 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences influence the complex calculation when to increase interests.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be attracted to this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. note bank staff.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects will be on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed Monetary Authority of the World has become.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the dawn leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "bear" its monetary expansion, caused confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly connected, the Fed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, V., noted this month that "the Fed has a story of overreactions on financial market movements that seem to be not linked to economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a Member of the Federal Open Market Committee who acts for an increase in interest, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to reduce its head interest by 0.75 percentage points at three meetings "respite more limited noticeable effects on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
One year later, the Fed representatives repealed these reductions.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability first only during a serious crisis such as market breakdown in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest settlement Committee.
The latest turbulencies do not come near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are excited," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it is changed, I do not think that it should drive ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/lager was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often called Thai Costco and is a Thai-Großhandelsmarkt, which also sells to the public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/store is a central location and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to swallow through the loops.
If the whole shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garcouch (good and priceworthy) in this shop is located near the boxes and has various include options.
What's here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
It's probably LAX-C.
Products are priceworthy and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat cover is extensive, as well as the fish blanket - the staff behind the tea will clean the fish and file the fish and even, on request, broke for you.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgants, whole ents, fish, bovine blood and gall, pig-natural tarm, fish balls, regional worst, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and cooks, including individual families and individuals.
The wide walks are suitable for shopping cars and barbecues.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The shop is located in a industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To welcome you warmly, it is not without the commitment of a countless official helper.
In Hoyerswerda there are also a number of people who support unselfish asylum candidates in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker home at Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a whole different lesson than at a right school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to shock women about the importance of good diet during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who sucks on breasts that are painted with pictures of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories to about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calories are not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should do.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women really concerns the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negatively.
Exceptions for the new Bernrider Sports Hall
The municipality Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be smoother for the solar system.
The plans for the long-looking tournament building at the Bernrider Sports sites are progressive: In the recent municipality session, the designed construction request was fully blessed without major discussions.
In the past, the body had decided, among other things, another application for a construction "exception" or "exemption" from the valid cultivation plan.
The "exception" was the authorization for a special form of the roof construction.
Thus, a "satellite roof with non-mittent first and roof-over" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants: "This will bring us together a wonderful large south roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "release" was, again, the ceiling that is expected to be less than ten degrees for energetic reasons - different from in the cultivation plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "release" was therefore needed because the cultivation plan on the roof is not allowing "exceptions" - whereas the Bernrider generally is restrictive in the application of exemption.
However, in the tournament building, it is not a returning project: "We do not create a precedence," says Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the sports center is a Community project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
The cost is approximately 2.3 million euros.
Aids are expected from the promotion of school and broad sports.
In the next step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Land Council for testing.
Clinic Pitenberg moves to Schongau
The Pitenberg Hospital is intended to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes a new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Piißenberg to Schongau.
This provides the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district, which confirmed the country advisor Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision will be taken by the Supervisory Board, and it will take place on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the pitenberg hospital.
The main majority was to move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are present.
The employees who are not able to go to Schongau are supposed to be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-White.
The staff are informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been head of the Schongauer Hospital since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice near the hospital.
In the question of who to join the successor, the name "fisher" came into the game, according to Jochner-White, who declared himself willing to take the lead from 1 October and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a "upgrading" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Internal Medicine", says Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist in heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized on gastroenterological diseases on the internal station.
Transitionally for the next two years, fishermen are supposed to join their team, if the Supervisory Board agrees to lead both houses until then in the next year the former hospital of the disaster, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Piißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the circuit had planned this for 2018 when the current recovery at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Country advisor Jochner-White, also chairman of the Supervisory Board, came to reputation that the house in possession of the Bundesknappschaft will be used in future as a accommodation for asylum webs.
"I'm excluding this." As it goes on with the property, Jochner-White couldn't say there are several thoughts.
There is currently a short-term care of Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said fishermen on the quasi move to the lech, which was "positive and very understandable" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years has not existed.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the posts of the doctor's director.
The Pitenberg Hospital (only 100 beds) was constantly threatened by closing in recent decades, departments were closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are demanded tonight (20.15 p.m.) at the Bergische HC.
In Wuppertal, the leader of the Federal Liga is the clear favorite, but there is no reason for superiority.
During the past season, the baths took a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to do with.

The exact fact of the accident was first unclear.
Criminal Police Detected.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rheinland-Pfalz victims of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing since Saturday from Rheinland-Pfalz.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young people and throwing their bodies into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rheinland-Pfalz who has been missing since Saturday has been victim to a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found in Rockenhausen on Tuesday evening at Kaiserslautern, as state lawyer and police informed us on Wednesday.
As suspicious, a 20-year-old arrested person also considered suspected of the act and led the detectives to the foundation of the body on the Tuesday night.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the morning after a autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
When looking for the young woman, the detectives first encountered personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of the missing ones, a suspect of the 20-year-olds became suspected.
The suspected actor then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested person admitted to the authorities in police interrogation that killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prisoner on Wednesday, the detectives put him to death.
Information on the closer circumstances of the action is intended to provide further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against apartment accidents
The situation on the German housing market is stressed.
Even more and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
Pressure on the apartment market grows.
Social housing is faced with a challenge.
The distribution fights on the German housing market have long started.
With the arriving refugees and seekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing into a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with poor income citizens around the last affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
The result is a study in order of the association "Social housing building".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's why 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence.
Many then come into the apartment market and come into the long serpents before the apartments.
According to the Statistical Federal Office, however, less than half of all asylum applicants lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only a result of the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also constitutes considerable negligences in the housing policy in recent years.
Germany is pushing out a dwelling deficit that grows from year to year.
At present, about 770,000 residential units were missing in the balloon areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large towns in WG rooms.
Young adults remained unwillingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flaw on the apartment market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per head has been decreased for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance "Social housing building" proposes a restart.
New incentives are aimed at rebuilding social housing.
In this way, the basic acquisition tax could be rejected and the basic tax for funded housing could be suspended for a period of time.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation possibilities are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodations by the State Bank KfW has already been well affected by cities and communities.
A good week after the start, at Monday evening, with EUR 184 million, had already been picked up over half of the around EUR 300 million available.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free conduct: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
To Hungary, there is practically no more throughcoming, as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the journey through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
The route is dangerous yet.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of Interior, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said the Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the disappearance of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have been broken to Croatia to get from there to West Europe.
500 people came across the border to Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had locked its border for refugees in the morning.
New laws that entered into force on the same day also make ordinary asylum procedures practically excessive in Hungary.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic declared: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning.
Most media reports have been reported from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and taxes to the Serbian border city of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
While at the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not hit borders.
There are other dangers in the borders: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining rooms are now supposed to create a safe passage quickly.
However, after the border is closed, there are little more refugees in Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the gateway on Monday, it had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws commit the overcoming and damage of the border tongue as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Southern border city of Szeged.
The condemned are threatening penalties up to five years and the dismissal from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, 94 asylum applications were received in the new "Transitzones" on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition from Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees had stayed there.
However, practically no one has the prospect of getting asylum in Hungary.
In Hungarian, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants are to be disposed of there.
Before the "Transitzone" in Roszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered together.
In Roszke, workers started cleaning up.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left at the street edge in the past weeks.
Locking grids were broken down and one of the recording camps in the border site was rebuilt.
For the purpose of this restructuring, no one wanted to express himself.
After closing the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria reaches only few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
But about 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to state statements.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train from there to Germany was stopped on the morning on the instructions of German authorities.
In free lassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor drove "Stradings" across the border
"We were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when, suddenly, ten people with travel bags stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany was surprisingly discontinuing railway traffic with Austria on Sunday, it was concluded for her in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beaches along with two other helpers and their cars driving across the border to near Passau.
Previously, we had the unforgotten guests first, with Jause and drinks.
We just told you we brought them to Passau with the car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OØN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man was not allowed to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
"We've been very happy," says Stadler.
On Sunday night in Wels, the train passengers were climbing from an ICE to a regional train direction of Passau in order to try over the border after the short term of announcement that railway traffic was stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was placed in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein the border crossing is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, a two-bridge race in sport - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends another cig thousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the camp Röszke to build structures that ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor has in high official and publicly pushed the position of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of national socialism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the borders.
The refugees will also have to find that the "loved land" that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to produce humanitarian conditions for protective seekers, given the persistent flows of refugees and the near winter.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-fest quarters
Konrad has to do with the refugee accommodation all hands full.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful rail iron banker to set up quarters for thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen," he reported his first success.
Also, the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was made without a big spine, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects with a need of 85.000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, 35.000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 countries will provide 15 000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without the ground," said Konrad.
He has already conducted discussions with the heads of the country.
These would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it goes well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will explain how the church will help.
Large expectations also put the asylum coordinator into the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, private persons can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation yesterday as "very high".
In emergency times, it cannot be that quarter donors have to meet a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the superlights.
For a period of time, "Notification standards" should apply.
The fact that he was more successful in accommodation, in contrast with the Ministry of Interior, was founded by Conrad with his experience.
I am an elderly Lord who is not without anything in the face of the truth.
Survival force is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause any costs of the Republic, as they explained themselves.
Their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four.
The search for quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as a office.
However, it seems that there are problems with the approval.
Linz demands a better division
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, the city of Linz is planning.
This is not necessary at the moment as the subjects are currently able to live without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations are to be checked for their properness.
The head of the city is criticizing the division of refugees within the federal country.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Grenzen are not locked down"
In a longer telephone with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pehringer (VP) accompanied the further approach in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not locked down.
The journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are precisely the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will first be no longer.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, Pehringer once more called for greater solidarity in the refugee question.
The fact that Austria also introduces controls at its borders is a logical result for Pehringer from the Germans' actions.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New Werf" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the Börsen-enoted IT Group S&T has been withdrawn, the remainder (2700 square meters) is intended to be rented to young innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In the IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine to invest in startup companies of the new shipyard and later also acquire any.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises, "The next runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic (FFG).
The building is packed for 60 years by Linz AG on S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building is already rented, for further 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni-owner opened second business in the Arcade
In the new shop Furla handbags are centered.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to lay a dog.
This project had to postpone the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt Arkade shortly: she has now gained growth in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop compared to the business where they sell, including bags, bags, shoes and garments of various manufacturers, everything is now about Damen's handbags of the brand Furla, money exchanges are available from 75 euros.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
Previously, several weeks have been rebuilt.
"I've been wondering for a long time whether to open another shop," says Breit.
The decision was vital, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also affected by the idea of their own location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the large room of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put wide by her mother in the veins.
I do most when something develops and I can show new trends at disgusting prices.
Why, when some women look at a beautiful handbag, they can't answer with the last sureness.
Maybe it's because a beautiful bag of every outfit is upgrading.
The browsing maker from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants were called advertising.
This property also associates some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses himself alienously, journalists reveling or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the U.S. President's Office is strongly upset the election campaign.
And cut it well off.
This is also registered in the Pfälzische Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the hairdryer is a concept of many in the Winzerdorf on the wine street.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place are over -ty corners related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in election mode.
Simone Wendel drew a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not deeply impressed in their cold towns," says Simone Wendel.
The buried cold towner has turned a funny documentary film about the place and his famous sprouts, which includes the Ketchup family Heinz next to Trump.
Trump, which is not known for modesty, also comes to word in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
He has not brought it to the king of the hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to believe that Trump is a little big-mouth, Wendel says.
Randomly the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surroundings, "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the Angeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the viber.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for golden graves in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first property purchases in New York.
But the lives of grandparents were not free from tragedy: their desire to return permanently to the homeland failed to the Bavarian state, among which the Pfalz was then.
He did not take Trump because he had once left without approval, the director of the Institute for Pfälzische Geschichte und Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the grandson of a "Illgal Emigrant".
This is in contrast with the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken abandoned about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to scare off illegal immigrants.
"As the poltered, it is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative of Trumps ("The grandmother was a born trumpet, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winner in retirement sees the American rather distant, "he's always so exhausting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt."
Residence host Veronika Schramm mentions like some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family gave something to the church standards at a visit, which generally came well.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They would find it better if he didn't win the choice because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good".
If those who had spoken at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "while he had never arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
What about the president?
"My President isn't," she says.
And, "The grapes will also mature without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed long, has seen 12 000 cinemas, even in the United States, the interest is awakening.
The Upperbayer municipality of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the National Park Berchtesgaden received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alps Association is responsible for granting the award.
A "climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protective area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson travel to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was radiated by the Bundeshauptstadt when Malcolm Turnbull made the crash of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderns David Koch and Samantha Armydays, was part of a one-week series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed not to play any role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397.000 viewers at the five main cities, compared to Today 339.000.
Today achieved a slightly rise in relation to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the hole to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is 314.000 at Today with an average of 349.000 viewers.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morningmen more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for checking.
Written by DAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama of a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics asked whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe revealed an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) ran to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Sea (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour spent 720,000.
Hot sea average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will rely on Nine that the Hot Sea will finally take place at 17:30 a.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn't make it possible to overflow the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret enclosed? ...
Lana Jeavons floods, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may unawarely have revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was filled with the greatest secret.
And none of the three girls left will certainly not give up whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons floods on the day before we get out of three, you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have been lyrics about why Wood is the perfect man and named his sense of humor, ambitions, family values and positive attitude as reasons for their desire to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If you don't, who should receive Wood's last Rose?", their answers could become the destructive who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons floods and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship since the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house, and (Sarahs) and Sam's energies noticed, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the earth, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as couples.
In their view, Mackay said that last week the house visit made her clear that Wood could be the one.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now indefinitely set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose wood, if not her, she was ridiculous.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the girls left in the same way - it's a distinction between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is radiated on Wednesday 19:30 p.m. on ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a barbecue as it did the Utsie-Rugby-Liga convertit at his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the current game after a injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of painting his smokes before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly at his press conference after the game.
The 49er Sports Reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne patzt at a point that was restored in the first play area by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian succession had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field fluently after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 108, that he couldn't imagine any worse start in his NFL carrier,
"This was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer with his Origin Debüt at the time in 2007, when a passport led to a test for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
In total, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the gays
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with arms.
Following his open challenge to President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was condemned, captured his oil company Yukos and undermined his democratic efforts.
The Free Electors demand the attitude of 1,000 new teachers in Bayern due to the high numbers of refugees.
Party and group head Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW heritage clause in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis at Bayern's schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
"Bless we will get disappearances in the Bavarian educational system."
The country-day fraction of the Free Electors will take place until Friday in the under-frankish municipality.
Actually, there were very different main topics.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voter meetings.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will override the clausur," said Aiwanger.
Awanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they had during the Yugoslavia war in the nineties.
"This is not how it goes, we need to deal with the causes," said the Free Electoral Chef.
Rejected asylum applicants want to move free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Awanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chef criticized that several federal countries are not consistent: "We need uniform standards throughout the federal states."
"Bayern's moving away, others don't."
"We need to become more handlingable there."
However, it is not supposed to be under the table of the country's policy in the city of Great Wall.
A yearlong permanent burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
During the new school year, Cultus Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasia started the pilot attempt "Medium Level Plus", where an extension of the high school average level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will take again nine years to the abitur.
But this is not far enough for pregnants.
"The G9 topic must be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We demand freedom of choice for all gymnastics who want to do so.
Free ride at G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after cops shoot rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber shots into a crowd who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday night, the violence broke out in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Head of District Office, said that more than 1,000 demonstrations had gathered outside a police station, some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they fell back to rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber shots, of which they are known to be able to kill, but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The contest was the last violent protests in Nepal's southern levels in weeks, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who wants to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officials, have been in violent disputes since 10th.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centralized for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the Constitutional Draft in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution might enter into force on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The property at Emder Youth Centre Olde Post is intended to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 quadrate meters planes.
It is planned a mixture of trade, trade and living - but there are no specific offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market an area of about 4000 square meters in a direct neighborhood to the Youth Centre Old Post.
The preparations are currently in progress.
It is planned to use the site for a mixture of trade, trade and living.
Waiting for the corresponding offers, it is said to the city.
Which investor is in question is not clear yet.
There were also no agreements concluded.
The city of Emden had purchased a part of the property located on the Ringstraße / corner Great Street a few months ago and had the buildings found on it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home resort at the small sea at Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Some people are still worried - they fear the sale of their recreational receipt
For months behind closed doors had been negotiated, crushed, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home house near Emden on the table are located on the small sea.
On Monday evening, the interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time publicly at the Emder Council's City Development Committee.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP group, who was thrown forward to the investor and the administration secret crushing, Ralf Behrends went from the system construction management to the offensive: "We have not yet answered all questions," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The about 10 to 12 million euros expensive projects have been discussed for months.
Heavy reactions among marine owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea bid owner and board member of the lieutenants' interests, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant cluster that surrenders all the other buildings."
In addition, as many other project critics, he fears that traffic would grow strongly by the planned size of the plant: "There must come all bus loads to calculate it," says Schulz.
However, what is happening exactly on the good hectare of the former guest place is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a solid concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the cultivation plans are still variable.
Zwillings growing at Gorillas in Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is delighted with a grown up at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old diane brought twins to the world yesterday.
Zwilling births are rare in Gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years back and had been in Frankfurt in 1967, says the zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet firm, since Mother Dian has kept her close to her body.
First, the "picture" reported.
NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide pressure system of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde islands, which has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical spinal storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for example, between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical spinal storm in the next two days, the weather experts stationed in Miami added.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign that is intended to spend $11 million for humanitarian organizations, which will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from the war broken and armed countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach in the advertising of the donation call on his blog.
Instead of allowing a manager to make an announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"One of our trips was many dark rail and bus trips, as well hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations are made available to four commonly useful organisations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: physicians without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations are doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeelief to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, who has distributed more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya, broken by war.

For mildly overweight diabetes patients, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight patients with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether mildly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-operative treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to take food.
Over the years, adipositas surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has been shown to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in humans who are sickly fatty with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered bold.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of adipositas surgery - stomach bypass and gastrointestinal formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgical surgery, 36% dissolved the disease of diabetes completely and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, compared to that, diabetes was completely dissolved only by one percent and partially by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of controls of blood pressure, the triglyceride and the "bad" LDL cholesterol were "in general better in the 'kirurgic' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflect the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to approximately 6 percent.
However, in the medical group, it remained stable at approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, says the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastritis group (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), increased decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study of heavyer people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group who tried conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage of survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was calm for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that as soon as they have collected these genetic changes that have connected their bodies firmly with fatness and diabetes, a reverse is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasing in Belletristics: a young woman, unpopular and inconvenient at school, meets the sword of her youth after years, and she is in love with her.
Likewise, in the recent Roman "We are not really that" by Luisa Binder.
Besides the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in boring and surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in boring and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her home.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the persistent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethic studies.
He requested that human interests be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the circumstances given.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admiral, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama commended the efforts of Germany and Austria in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for thousands of refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to reflect on how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States led to a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolence in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violentness.
"I know his motives were good, but he put on violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increases in the use of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow strong alcoholic hand-desinfectants, says Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intake of hand-defectives in children under 12 years of age, reporting to the toxic control centres, increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 1617 in 2014.
"Kinders are getting more and more frequently on these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a mute sample in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how youths drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Adolescents claimed to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water in order to get a tougher drink.
Young children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with soil bear, wine grapes and orange dust that are very attractive to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Vigilance Center at the Kansas University Hospital, the Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let any swallow whisky around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the reach of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to drink much alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes from stinking hand disinfectant after earth bear, was taken to a emergency.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold which is legally considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain-trauma, as the girl had fallen down by alcohol and shot her head, said Ritchey.
"This was very terrifying," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing toxic, undeclared ingredients.
Workers of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was recorded as an active substance.
In January, three of the fourth class students in the State of New York planned to poison her "common" teacher by interpreting antibacterial products around the school room," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned her from her room.
The police viewed the definite plan as "speaking" and pointed out discipline measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old carrier has been easily injured in the case of an accident on the cross-country between Nordring and Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-spange to the circular transport industry area and noticed too late that two advanced vehicles had stopped during the circulation.
As a result, he screwed in the back of a audit with his truck and pushed this vehicle on a ford Fiesta.
In the accidentally involved vehicles, matter damages were caused from approximately 10,000 euros, the police informed.
The audit of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be dropped.
Kitchen: No disharmony with Celtic
Griffiths plays the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow down, Deila admits that the hopes are on a bad place, but that he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA for Neilson's accusation and Warburton will be cautious about January new commitments that could destroy the unit of the cader
Dons increases leadership over Celtic on five points
ADAM Rooneys Elfmeter in the first half of the time, Aberdeen gave a tight victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays talks about disharmony downwards
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, which insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control, as they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football boring Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers Medieval Player and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rivality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here don't just talk about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it is not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent excretion from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10-mans from Aberdeen, which now stands at the top of the table with five points.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes players better.
Now it's so important to stand together.
Warburton carefully at January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which suggested that he pointed out some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful when signing new accesses and persevering that he does not want to disturb the unit of the Ibrox-Cader.
The ex-Chef of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate themselves what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea Stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, has indicated that he could withdraw when his contract is running out at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with a harsh knee for two years and has not managed the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle because of Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the red map of the defendant was later revoked - the third red map of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains with what he said and persevered: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented."
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The unfortunate Hibee was reproved after he admitted to sing a song with stumbling texts about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a trap in the area of Roseburn in Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the storm, adding, "It's sure to say that I'm not returning to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United-Management
Simon Donnelly maintains that Dundee United's board still has confidence in the management team to rotate things - but admits that the decline has to end on the playground.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We're gonna bring the boys back to Trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton "uncomfortable".
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies in order to see a seventh successive league victory, which brought them a five-point forespring before Celtic at the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half time.
McInnes said: "There is no crew who has won everything, in pocal games or leagues, which have not even won the games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while increasing overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in May to July at 164,000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above 5.5 per cent of the UK, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12.000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the UK average of 73.5 per cent during the quarter.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has placed the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunkenes disturbed the expiry
Since the security staff couldn't satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray, the officials were able to take the disturbances in mind.
A atemal coal test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The growing one was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promille and remained at first.
Why I will be a witness of a execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it won't happen, I will sit in a watcher gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January on his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists may see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applications available than places, a macabere lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, he will observe it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship with telephones and two and a half hours of visit.
I like the guy.
We're laughing a lot when we talk.
The prisoners tell me I can't be a Witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to give up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I complain with her.
She admitted that she could have made it better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him that he can remove me from his Witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
A man who was convinced to get out of Canning River for moist police persecution
The Canning Vale Policeman remained dry when he convinced the man from the Canning River.
A man's attempt to depend on the police was unfair when he was in watching and sucking water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to convince him gently to return to the shore.
The Canning Vale police was called to a house peace break in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspects, this one tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the graves to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired inhabitants to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threaten to stop the race sport
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his places last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last stroke on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for the race sport and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt peak sample with Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had retained 18 months because of the spionage charges and didn't want it to "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I intended to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting a long time on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do this, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had brought the bomb up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - which I will name when I get asked - and offered him a job in my places to deliver information about what I do in my stead," said Moody at Racing.com.
You seem to think I'm a deceiver.
If that is the case, they should surely touch their noses because they failed when trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are it still today.
Should this lead me to the view that it becomes personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and may make people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say now makes her think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exert pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the trainer has built up with the long-lasting Kobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to his saying that he could "go out his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbreaked Master Black Caviar, described the racing day treatment rule "shameful", after a pack of mud or sound was placed on the horse legs, which disrupted the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for it," he said.
"One of my employees wrongly put mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been the whole day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on the racing day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the race day. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize that we need rules, but here you went too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver flight
In the weekend, the police arrested a man after a crash with a cyclist and subsequent driver flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the car driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driving fleet and failure to provide assistance and other traffic infringements.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals for claims to fight rings
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy referred to criticism in tackling his players as "Agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster's trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden comment on the Storm team, after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "to-good" in rings.
Bellamy defended his team's thanks and said they were focused only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team voted confidently as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"There appears again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Thankles to a real focus, and that has made the trend turn for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great crew to train. He is therefore probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's already funny how this always appears at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "awful" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos against cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that a exciting game?
Or are you doing breaks and no points are something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in a phase.
The Storm team has free on this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night in the prefinal at AAMI Park. Ticket sales begins from the next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 cash after drug charge
A man who may threaten a lifelong punishment for his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, who came over Vanuatu from South America and placed in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was observed as he met his colleagues in the hunting port during the morning and later in the café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly lifelong punishment for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire quantity and that it could have been for an harmless reason in the café.
The judge of the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfathers had offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the statutory statements of the two people, it is clear that the amount of security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing, he warned.
Maximovic was released against deposit, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily and holds a starting block of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Chauffeur house breaks apart
In a train accident with three trucks on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver has been severely injured on the Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked before a permanent construction station towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape the left at the last moment, as the police told.
The headquarters of the accident causer rose completely apart.
The driver was severely injured to a hospital.
The A5 between fractional and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was an injury of EUR 122.000.
Stevan Hogg used the phone of girls to attract pedophile to send pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to demand pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logged in to an online messaging service, from which he received a series of inappropriate pictures of children that were sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did so, as it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then he "used to be a policeman to scare them".
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addict - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were performed by him on the computer, but he said that it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare pedophile.
He was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and faced the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared himself guilty in the sense of the prosecution to have taken inappropriate pictures of children on 14 June last year, to have violated the obligations on 25 January this year and not appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg would not appear in the register of sexual criminals, as it could be argued that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael rejected the judgment until October in order to receive background reports on social work.
In this case, Hogg was granted a deposit, but was held in inquiry due to consultations with other cases that were still outstanding.
It was included in the list of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.
Closers exclude small border transitions to Germany
More and more refugees are taken off the major control points at the German-Austrian border.
Many lockers left people increasing on smaller border transitions from fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a speaker of the Federal Police.
Along the border flow of Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been arrested in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had been walking over bridges and roasters to the German side.
There they are taken into receipt by federal policemen and forwarded to registration.
At Municher's main railway station, there were significantly more refugees on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
A speaker said in the morning that about 700 people arrived in the capital of the country alone until 8:00.
After the re-introduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Trigger of Tropenstorm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across West Europe, hot sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) informed in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the trigger of the tropical storm "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda islands in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunders are expected mainly in bathing.
According to DWD, the black forest, the swabic alb and the soil sea circuits with bows of 60 to 90 hours.
On Friday, then, the sun can be looked longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years the car builders on the IAA show their new things.
In 2015, the compact cars are particularly well sold.
Cars from the Compact Class are currently specially asked: around 28.1 per cent of the new authorisations were found on this segment in August alone, according to the Power Travel Association (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (Repository 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel has an entry under the largest competitor VW Golf in view, which starts at 17 650 Euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1,4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
The heaters also offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, including three cylinder benzines for the first time.
In contrast to the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five-doors at first.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what, next to the Astra on the IAA, will be driven on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitors Mégane to race.
At the fair, the Mégane is seen only as a fifth door in a conventional and emphasized GT version.
He comes into trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is new in the segment.
The Nissan delegate wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fully fits into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will receive a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, a diesel is also offered with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model will be offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum rotation moment is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer data.
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but renewed around is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroen delegator mainly put hand on the front party: Here the cooler grill was rearranged and the modified sheet lamps were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apples CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a series of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are human insignificant
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-heft of the Court of Justice agency a tile that had been in a too small cell for months.
Because of the injury of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation when they are in too small cells.
This was decided by the Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can hope for money even if they were only a few days locked in the close rooms (Act.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This was the success of an ex-fighter with his constitutional dispute in Karlsruhe: he was located in the Berlin Tribunal between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of ground; the toilet was spaciously not separated.
Then, according to his lawyer, the man who was now on the free foot was moved into a larger cell.
His complaint of arrest for the invaluable conditions of imprisonment against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for a re-examination there.
You see the man's dignity hurt.
Chamber Court now decides on the height of compensation
Although for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days of penalty for compensation were significant, it said a compensation claim was made.
Otherwise, "to fear a worsening of the legal protection of personality".
The chamber court now has to clear the amount of money remuneration.
Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked locked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multitude of a cell is also insignificant without separate toilets.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, who had certified an infringement in a parallel case in November 2009.
The complainant had stayed in a cell similar to the case of Karlsruher, between 15 and 21 hours a day over three months.
In the last few weeks, the Berlin prisons had also come into the headlines for lack of staff.
Consequently, prisoners are repeatedly included in 23 hours, the aggression increases, and even struggles are supposed to have already occurred because of the excited situation.
According to the Legal Press Office, 21 places in Tiles are not occupied because of deficiency, 19 are to be disappeared in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
Approximately 800 000 asylum applicants will come to Germany this year, according to the predictions of the Federal Ministry of Industry, according to Vicecancer Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated decisiveness in view of the unusual challenge: "I say repeatedly, we can do this, and we can do it."
What happens to Germany gives the following overview.
It is used according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments each year - and for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as has been built to date (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially in the case of payable hire objects: Every year 60000 to 80 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and for these specially favourable apartments, refugees will also apply.
Consequently, Bundesbauminister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from 518 million to one billion euros at the moment.
The Pestel Institute's view is very little: 80 000 social apartments have to be created annually and the covenant should invest an increase of 6.4 billion per year.
Researchers and the Federal Ministry of Construction agree that more tax benefits for investment in housing must also be made.
According to estimates from the Institute for Employment and Vocational Research, 55 percent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not systematically ask for their qualifications to help them enter, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-relevance of immigrants, says migration researchers Dietrich Threnhardt.
In Germany, according to Threnhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to recognize work.
While there was previously a ban on work for asylum candidates of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation, restricted asylum applicants to a residence site.
In society, even because of the lack of professionals, most of the views that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is the lack of German skills.
There is not yet a sufficient offer of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most frequently provided by personal contacts.
Therefore, the construction of networks is, according to Threnhardt, the Kingsweg to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children into the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 per cent: "For the rooted parents it is first very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes hands in different languages.
The Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity, for example by allowing more scholarships, if the need for women is strongly increased by the large number of refugees.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for education in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack in them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal country prohibits asylum applicants or dulds the study - the only exception was until Berlin, Innensenator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to university.
For refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits in accordance with the asylum application performance law when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not receive Bafög, as they do not fall under the circuit of the bafög eligible persons.
Duld refugees must have lived up to four years in Germany to be Bafög-justified, from 1 January 2016, this span is shortened to 15 months.
This financial gap must be closed, however, demands Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Work.
Students should be given Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is a major part of their identity.
The State should grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches and develop the existing state church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish a Islamic well-being association that cares professionally for the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
Thus, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and give it certain control possibilities.
This includes the willingness to act against religious fundamentalism.
The president of the Muslim Central Council, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany on Thursday.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany “have immediately their right to live here, in Germany,” he said at the Bavarian radio.
He proposed that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a subject of society.
In this way, the majority society will also need to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, for a short decade agency of anti-discrimination and a general law of equality.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
The same chances for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-White Germans for a long time, and to which international agreements as the anti-racism convention Germany are committed, must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for all.
Generally Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected to date, says doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"With regard to man power and capabilities, we can do that," he said to the daily level.
However, additional money must flow into the system for this purpose.
In order to avoid patches, Montgomery demands to deliver health cards to all ancients immediately when registering.
The benefits provided could later be calculated with the Federal Countries.
And long-termly, it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited performance catalogue provided by the asylum applicant law.
Otherwise, the doctors are especially able to create the language barriers.
So far, the Berliner health scientist Thea Borde has proved, migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in medical practices, interpreter costs should be charged, it demands.
However, many refugees would be helped with more general medical offices in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic view.
For example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities among refugee children, and for young people it is about HIV information.
However, with the partially other pictures of disease, German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite failure or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And with regard to the medical deficiency, the refugees may even be in sight of relieving.
The Syrians had a highly developed educational system, some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they need to prove their qualifications and possibly carry out tests again.
At least half of the refugees who arrive in Germany are psychologically ill according to estimated by the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK): most suffer from posttraumatic stress disorders or depression.
Especially harmful are refugee children, says Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study of TU München demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany.
Those who are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorders suffer, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with breathing nuts, dizziness, heartrasses and death anxiety.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances, strong terribleness and emotional dizziness.
To prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
However, to date only four percent of the psychologically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can make a request for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
Moreover, in the social offices most of the experts or doctors who are not educated for psychiatric diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misevaluations, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
The Circus Probs, with the new "Leitenschaft" inscendant, reacts to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressions and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus invites to the manege on the tile for dreaming.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, Animal Teacher and Junior Chief.
"Leitness" - under this motto is the current man-eigning scenario.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"We are important to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Junior Chief stresses.
"Manegencocktail with World Town-Flair", says director Reinhard Probst his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm in their ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the stupid movies, the Cuban Duo wants to take it easy.
Easyness and movement - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is intended to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous lax salves, the acrobatics of the Circus sample also fascinates with finger tip feeling and jointness.
Balancing with the single wheel on a bullet?
No problem for He Yuan.
At the same time, snake people are fascinating and scared.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinated with their movement.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in all respects.
"The animals belong to our family," stressed Stephanie's mother, Brigitte test.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus are all too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probs also comments on this: "If our animals are not good, it's not good for us either."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strip unit.
The "four leg artists", as they are lovingly called, will be read out of the eyes if possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it doesn't want to go to the manege either.
So the highest commandment: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together eight years in a walk and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte sample.
The Zebroid is not ready for the manege yet, but it is the unique maskot of the circus sample.
So, for each visitor, there should be something to do with it.
"One is safe," says Stephanie, "whether five or 1 200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
The Circus Prob will be invited every day at 17 and 20 a.m. from September 17 to 20 a.m. to his ideas.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the idea the prices are reduced at 17 o'clock.
In addition, the animal view is open every day from 10 to 18 p.m.
Simbabwe Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, African oldest leader, fell down the staircase from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also grieved by the statements of opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with Buhrufen.
Last month they had embedded him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against disturbing Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not shown, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The Chief Speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers of politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two stock exchange-noted companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and its services business.
The expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in an explanation.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be focused on the provision of unreachable, integrated technology solutions for companies," says the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and their Palo Alto Garage was called "the place of birth of the Silicon Valley".
HP has been through a massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the second largest PC manufacturer in the world and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area, based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
No one stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went on to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship will be uncertain in the next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate knee injury and then returned to his old turn during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
That's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his knees or to the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a pure medical perspective, but as wingers also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injuries, every time a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 matches in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight times since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League Clubs that have most injury days to record.
No one accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a suspicious period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body will stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and he will pass through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions-League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Todtenham Hotspur on the next Wednesday, and Wenger takes a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
We are also able to start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance, and the players who need to make a small break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue by Group F, the Maximir Stadion in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo has also been lost after 41 games after the "indefeitable" campaign has been launched in the last season.
The stadium was shocked on Tuesday evening by a earthquake, measured on the Judge Scale 3.2.
This year it was the tenth in Zagreb.
No more believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions-League Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope of leading the association to its first Europe-pokal-triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreams.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is obvious, especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year hill.
In 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In trying to address the problem, the Campaign against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a painful life) announced 2015 as the year of man to question the culture, which prevents men from seeking help if they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the fight to tackle this challenge.
A recent study in more than 2,000 high school school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "soft mood" his chances of healing doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you need to have friends for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style of substance, the immediate response is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, vital and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a far deeper impact on our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequently embraced, moments at football watch in cozy seats and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it at any rate, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of telephone care explained it to me: "My listening role for people who feel depressive and are suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old speech "I'm dealing with" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it is seen as a weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that come in mind to me when I try to offer more long-term handling mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status via the phone may help people at moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFeast with the completely newly designed scenes of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from start to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFesti
Di Maria meet to help PSG crush malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his meeting against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to move through Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Princess Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their predominance when Cavani reached a headball gate in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in the group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they are not only seeking the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but a improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, there was no class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the association with which he started his illustrated career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League. Therefore it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and relax to look back, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect during the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not reached one or two more gates."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which in the weekend could hold a 2:2 unavoidably on its own place against Bordeaux in the first Liga, but he was exposed in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing tower was referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he indicated why, when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he finished with Johan Wiland beautifully in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, which struck Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, came to Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But except a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes resigned, with some mispaids and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who patched in the first half alone at no less than five trials and then gave up after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Yet he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria transformed into a turn shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52th minute at the pound ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer thus achieved its sixth seasonal tower, after Ibrahimovic had set up a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an outstanding intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was reappeared to a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions-League game was in December last year.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish Liga, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Hut away from Paris!
It was a great game of them!

The Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a public visit to the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a declaration on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.

A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy motorway, the evil awakening came.
With a company in the Gotha district, you can meet the dream and once rent and drive a V8 US port car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.
This is what a 29-year-old from the Gotha district did.
At the A 71 at Arnstadt, the dream was then out and over.
The 29-year-old lost control over the sports car, got on a wet railway into the shuttle and drove into the lead planke.
The sports car suffered total damage, nobody was hurt.

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and Europe Master Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was evidently a few years ago in front of the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, which then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish masters, three times pocal winners, four times Champions-League winners, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Katar.
Yet, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now explains that he was already before the EM 2008 departure from Barcelona.
"There was told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we didn't do anything," he says.
And that also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer of Bayern."
"Rommenigge wanted me."
For a reminder: In summer 2008 Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not occur.
And the decisive man today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the crew without me."
"It's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's time 2008/2009 would run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarterfinale of the Champions League against the Bayers over the entire distance on the grass, switched off the red (4:0, 1:1) and at the end celebrated the king class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation down
Matt Damon faced the African filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a follow-up of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actress Brown suspended the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected turnbook of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, you will do it when you occupy the movie and not at the occupation of the show," Damon assured.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulted ignorance, and called "Hoo! Wow. OK," when the comments of the actress of The Martian stuck.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show fans.
"I want people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she's a nut that's beaten by her white coach.
The producer of Dear White People sat down for the Finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the government rights on the film; Damon replied that their government could give us something we don't want.
After the discussion was issued, the social media exploded before disappointment about Damon's comments.
Twitter-user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Mat Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - that is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time at which precise Rassian representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Live Matter movement achieved a country-wide effect and forced lawyers and authorities to impose discriminatory practices against colorful impression.
In February, the singer Prince announced the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Award.
"Album's silent matter," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox-News personality of Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group.
"The Black Live Matter network is a love group," said the leaders.
Recently, Damon was announced that he was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media mogule, who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first Champion
Profi port climber and service aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which had just completed its seventh season, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle parcours.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and Cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to finish.
The final task was to climb at a 75-foot climb seal in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time he was the first athlete who completed the effortful phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge completely three seconds faster, making him a victor.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hardly fought victory, still under shock about the winning of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $100,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brits, although he was the first to finish the parcours, did not receive any price money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's cruel about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received plenty of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the rolls.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eight staffel, the rotation work will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers slew by Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
In the past, they were one of the best teams in the baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the target field on Tuesday.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F word, which was so difficult to find over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit pointed three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the nineth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 Innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to finish this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, so I want to go very focused into the game.
The designed Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He has twisted the sleeve well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (suite training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs in the back meeting at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand of Blaine Hardy.
Hardy surrendered wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designed Rookie Slachtmann Miguel Sano, who entrissed a two-run to Drew Verhagen's right hand.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th in the Major League in this season that Plouffe hit a double play
When Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the nineth inning, the wall created a RBI double against the closer of the tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the position of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stood out Sano at three pitches for his fifth saving.
Detroit benefited from a non-moveable Phil Hughes at the moment of the game.
The Tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right hand-veteran, which had been deleted from the injury list before the game, after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Certainly not the beginning I wished," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I loose and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game that created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right side, created another race, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center-Fälder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"This was a big battle," said Twins-Manager Paul Molitor.
He did not beat very well, but he took the right place.
Hughes was located in a Pitch count, no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever's Law Hand A.J.Etter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez expired because of an injury to the castlers.
He is investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the list of injuries due to a shoulder disorder, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is erased from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He has missed since August 20 because of a destruction in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will be played against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are to live in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people therein will then be placed in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city Wiesbaden announced on the night of service.
It counted with 450 to 750 refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1,000 refugees may stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the government presidency responsible for initialisation, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Also Frankfurt and Hanau have established emergency accommodations in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The Head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He called on the European States to "collectively look away".
Four years ago it had been a joy that the Kelch had passed a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is landing in front of our door," he said at the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance on the ground for refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders again.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner declared on Tuesday night at the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Nor did Germany send refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
Concerning the question of an agreement that Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there has already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and German representatives in this respect.
Concrete figures did not mention them and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not been able to agree to a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Ministers want to take a new start at a special meeting on the next Tuesday (22 September) for a binding distribution of 120 000 other refugees.
In view of the strong refugee attitude in Germany, the covenant wants to support the countries more in the first start-up and distribution of people.
The covenant will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced at the late Tuesday after almost four-hour discussions with the Prime Ministers at the Office of Cancer in Berlin.
Merkel underlined, those who need protection, they would also come.
But those who do not have a dwelling perspective can not stay in Germany either.
This view has been divided in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now needs to cope with a "great force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
In the night on Tuesday, Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia.
A few hours after that, the government announced that the border to Romania should be locked off with a fence in Budapest.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia from the EU.
Hungary wanted to prevent Schlepper from seeking out-of-the-road routes across Romania, said Hungary’s Foreign Minister Peter Szyjarto to the planned new border town.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the door.
In Turkey, there were thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border.
Space Sonde "Cassini" finds the ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icespancer of the Saturn moon Enceladus, a global ocean is swimming.
This closes researchers from observations of the space zone "Cassini".
Thus, the moon easily tumbles on its track around the ring planets.
Although this dumb movement is only small but still too large for a continuously fixed heavenly body, a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) says of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the Icarus Fachblatt.
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, in 2006, "Cassini" had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturn moon, spearing water vapour and ice partikels and thus feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least the South Pole had to have a underground sea, the astronomers then closed.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to leave about a month for Offensive Valdet Rama.
A study revealed an injury of adductors in the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Municher Löwen, the diagnosis means "predicted four weeks of compulsory break".
"That's hard for us, Rama's a hard loss."
"Of course we need to think now," said Sports Director Necat Aygün the "picture" deployment with a view to the possible commitment of a unanimous professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties first presented a defensive.
The 30-year-old Mrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brain shock next week.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to join the race training.
Okotie had been injured in Fortuna Düsseldorf in the party (0:3) in a violent collapse at the head.
In contrast to the first fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangos contains much sugar
Mangos are exotic and soft-sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his narrow line, he is often more advised by them.
For mangos contains relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins and vitamins E and C are in them. However, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-grade beta carotine.
Thus, the one eating the fruit supports sight, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too solid and smell pleasantly.
The scaling color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
You should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
But a mango also gives a special note to heartwarming courts.
It mildens the slightly bitter taste of some leave salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangogogutney fits well for fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS sets up up to 95000 aids for Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS informed on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched.
Already last year, the UPS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 95,000 aids.
In view of the thriving online business, UPS and his competitor FedEx have been taking arrangements last year to be armed for Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliverys had brought the package services harsh criticism.
First fountain storm, then outstanding cold front
The next night, as Meteoschweiz informed on Tuesday, breaks through the valleys of the Alps' North Side of the Feans.
On Wednesday and the night on Thursday, the feathers partially blow with storm starch through the feathers.
After Thursday morning, we are crossed by an outstanding cold front that brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature reduction.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a wide range of deep printing areas across the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the Alpennord side breaks through the valleys in the night on Wednesday.
As a result, the peanuts are blown up to Thursday morning in the feather valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km/h, united and in particular in Urnerland partially also with more than 100 km/h.
The peanut can move on to the neighbouring Mediterranean, and even on the mountains, orcan bows of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy feathers provide summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, moisture at the south of the Alps begins to rise.
Here, rain will be used to stop until Thursday evening.
In total, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours must be calculated with partially over 100 litres of rain per square meter, which has already fallen in large amounts of rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the peanut goes out of the air, as a result, a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially tailored rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshs strongly to stormy, and temperatures decline significantly.
The following days are present in the north in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it becomes sunny and warmer by up to 25 degrees in the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther place
Nearly 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday an unnamed place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German reformer.
At the Piazza Martin Lutero, he is now considered a German theologian of the Reformation.
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Colosseum.
The name had been requested by the work community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, practitioner of the Evangelical-Lutherian community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes over centuries were often able to live as a minority only in the hidden.
The place becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed a few months in Rome as a young Augustin monk around the 1510/11 year.
He then felt the city as a lost bable of sin.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the evening church with his theses against the dispute trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (old) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
Was the word at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with beautiful pictures.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colourful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is not even meaningful with "lusty" pictures.
On the contrary, adapting the relevant topics can be quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has taken a subjektiv-artistical selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
It has been produced cycles dedicated to such topics as crossways, plagues, commandments or Father's Ours.
He has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And above all, it is the author Klaus Altepost who, on the basis of painting, disagreed with the respective Bible texts.
He interpreted the texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into today, in current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each of them a set of artists, which here forms his very personal thoughts about the respective situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
So the 75-year-old also allows a double deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimity.
Emotions were ultimately a result of the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 born in Werneigerode and raised in Berlin, come from a family that belonged to the strictly Protestant Lordhuter order.
"Then the training happened once with the pipestock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to work this up to possibly reconcile myself with the Lord's Father."
His second concern is to help the art back to more job value in fast-living time: "The perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today, and it is loud.
Symbolics are pushed out there.
Artists have another desire and delight to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "come into" the pictures, let them act on themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday to the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always" to have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old has not taken care of fully understanding the Bible, but has chosen the important, also mysterious topics for him.
"This wasn't a collaboration at the height of the eyes," says Altepost, "this is about the pictures, the text just explains."
For Hans Möller from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deep his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and those of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX Rail approaching
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, land hills modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX railway, it was already finished again.
Failure in politics and administrations brought forth grinding, especially for the inhabitants who did not tolerate the railway.
So hills displaced, searched for new place - now with formal planning and application for construction authorisation.
The authorization will enter into October, the first municipality of Sabine Mosebach-Bock has now been able to communicate in the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year still happens visible," she said.
It was then supposed to be started with the work at the former hall bath without "external delay".
DFB intensified commitment for refugees
The DFB expands its commitment for refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign in the weekend.
The football responds to the rising situation in Germany and ensures its help in dealing with the upcoming problems.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunion."
"Nobody can in principle say that this is nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be interesting for each individual to handle this topic," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday at the office of the Kanzler, and there I meet the Minister of State Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and wants to help.
But the decisive softness has to put the policy.
The German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program continues until 2019," explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Federal Ligists also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will carry the print "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricotary instead of the otherwise common sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can," said Leverkusen's sports manager Rudi Völler of the "Image" session ( Tuesday) and called the project "self-understandability".
"The refugee dream goes to everyone, no one can look away."
"We football allies can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hopenheim's manager Peter Rettig spoke of a "predominant sign of the Liga".
For the EM qualification game against Hungary on this Friday, the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Sales.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a large Community work of German football".
That all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places was great.
Similarly, small and smallest associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have published is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already collected the entire sum for 2015," said Niersbach.
Reports: Head of SAP will lose an eye in accident
According to several reports, the head of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost the left eye by a crash at the beginning of July.
In the case of the accident on the staircase in his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a water glass after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reported the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeded, was not powerful, then dragged out on the street - that's what he told us last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Platner.
But McDermott could check his work.
"In October we meet before the Supervisory Council meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager will be at the meeting and "fullly working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday issue) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
"Of course, I was regularly in contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually penetrates between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
If it is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can happen like this."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren Replacement Pilot Magnussen except Fight ...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was crashed by the wheel.
He is therefore at the night race in Singapore on the weekend as little as reserve drivers for the two stam pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the big price of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback from Marco Reus have ended in the first group game of the Europe League.
The national player will also be missing by the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky) in the Duell.
"We can't get back to him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga Topspiel gegen Leberkusen, the BVB-Coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his professional, Tuchel will not only change his stamp on the giant position.
So he announced a change at the gatekeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weidenfellers will be used in all Europe-League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He is very likely to argue with the second party.
The research statement by co-player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, the middle field player Julian Weigl thinks it can be achieved: "This is not the way Marco is wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take off the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants a preliminary role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the Federal Government in changing the car of technological precursor.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinett decided a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday, in Frankfurt, at the edge of the Automesse IAA, Dobrindt spoke of a "new Mobility Timer".
The automated and networked driving will increase transport safety and provide less steadiness, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his official colleagues from the G7 countries, which also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Transport Ministry's Strategy Paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid transition to digital hearing radio.
For testing new technologies, a test route is currently created on the highway 9 in Bayern.
In order to "no additional risks of liability to the driver" the Federal Government will "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum rate for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 hours.
The Federal Government also intends to amend the Vienna Convention, which is to date only for people as drivers.
When driving automated, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in second speeds.
Following a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatic driving will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driving-free vehicles on public roads are "expected until far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver resistance systems and high-automatic driving functions at the location of Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to about €8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said the SPD transport policy Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
The Germans still see self-running cars skeptically - much more than French or Americans.
A weekly survey by the Forsa Institute submitted on Wednesday on the AA on behalf of the Test Organization Dekra results that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be carried out in the next ten years, 32 percent will only expect it in 20 years, 31 percent will not believe it at all.
In France 21 per cent of the surveyed until 2025 with automobiles, in the USA 33 per cent.
Without prejudice, the drivers in Germany are not ready to fully rely on a self-driving vehicle.
After an inquiry of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to carry out control throughout all the roads.
On the railway, 15 percent of the flowing traffic could still be imagined, 45 percent in straw.
Well, every fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll exits team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to look at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October only in detail.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM learning in Düsseldorf.
Boll was at that time on the flight at a long-term date of sponsorship in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected on Friday.
"Without Timo the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who introduces the setlist in Jekaterinburg, also reminded of the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo was also missing at that time, and we became European champion."
"We should focus on this," explained the World Range List Fifths.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has taken a serious injury on the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defence officer was hit and exchanged after long treatment.
The first diagnosis suggested a railbreak in the 20-year-old companion of Bastian swine climbing.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion views and a wax-figure-grusel cabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: show window pups, which, thanks to video projections, look terrifyingly human.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, among other things with Madonna's stage outfit, to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus to put men in rocks.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was bleached, now it is real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizen Climb on the course), which was seen at the art hall of the Hypoculture Foundation from 18 September, it is a luck that the fashion creator has changed his initial rejecting attitude to a view of his person.
Actually, he was opposed to it, 'For me, a exhibition sounded a little after death,' he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
Exposures give an insight into the hardly overlooking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed a training.
Chronologically the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed total artwork for which a lot of effort has been done: to fresh the dolls, for example, a stylist has been engaged.
14 tons of material the makers have carried to Munich according to the Kurator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the October festival, there was another special shamemaker: a leather pants outfit with corsett.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are wiser than men") and in people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, sophisticated fashionable walking attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a pop, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion he later taught himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the drafts of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion, he was unable to pay the models.
They got nothing, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitz as fashion-Nische
In the past, it went into the long sticking machines and to cloak to make meters.
The embroidered substances and peaks developed in large amounts for customers, for example, to covers and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, director of the fashion tip Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitz, fashion played a greater role, then was pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re-discovered as a nice.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: top in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and regional carriers.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which is linked to past styles, represents a growing potential for contracts.
Who does not use nischs in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is, together with nine other companies, a member of the Branchenverband Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only they may carry the protected label.
Over the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been broken away.
Private businesses and the wholesale are almost out of business.
Our products are hardly reaching the customers in this way.
Massware is currently made much cheaper in the Asian space and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are weak, currently to Russia and to the United States.
Reasonable reasons for new ways.
The industry association also attempts to point through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the sticky pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have a quality seal, which shows that we are producing environmentally and socially tolerantly."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Sneeberger Outdoor Office of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in sticking and tops.
To contradict competition from the Asian area, high-quality and innovative products must be found.
That takes time and courage.
There is an excitement field between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that have to think above all economically," Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design is often easily varied to keep a customer tribe.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small cuffs at some places.
The Plauen Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired to say, "I couldn't start with a traditional plate top before."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an expensive process, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauen Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in plates and surroundings and who want a memorial.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen Spitz.
Disney plants new "Mary Poppins" movie
You don't want to touch legends, but Disney's still awaiting a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to the " Entertainment Weekly" it is not a new film, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
Those who play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews are still unclear.
But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the movie.
Xi urges to open the economy broader for the world
In order to promote growth, the economy must open itself more widely outside, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, a group assigned to govern the reform.
"China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and to improve business foundation strategies," he said in a talk at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will bring about new vitality and new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and recovery of the inhabitants' merger system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it has a greater role to play in the allocation of resources to the market, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more open, said the statement.
The government will also relieve controls of the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their businesses.
The statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment are opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide them with better services," said the statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of the lawyers to exercise their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, as reported in a declaration published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the level of mercury in robbery fish
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large robbery fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nervous toxicity.
The Consumer Organisation Foodwatch, which has a relevant EU work paper, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and adverse reactions of missing industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant and infants with full growth," said Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nervous toxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram fish.
However, large rape fish are already so severely loaded with mercury that, on the basis of the existing limits, approximately 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubled the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be inappropriate.
In contrast to this reduction, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to reinforce the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick" because smaller peacefishes, such as carps, are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
Thus, the reduction in small fish is "a perfide distraction manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," said Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilver is a high-toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched through the food chain, especially in robbery fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "already small quantities can cause, especially in the case of unborn damage to the nervous system".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its website with regard to the current maximum values that a "health risk of the general population" is not expected.
Quecksilver comes into the environment mainly through coal incineration.
According to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants deliver more than six tonnes of mercury per year to Annalena Baerbock, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, such as in Elbe, Rhine and Donau, was "permanent and surface covering", the "level" had been quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European warnings against mercury in fish already included the most frequently reported health risks in the RASFF EU warning system.
