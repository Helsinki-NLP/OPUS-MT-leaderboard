Walish Members do not want to appear as "muppeters"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, which is today known under the abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Walisian Parliament.
Representatives from the whole political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridiculation.
A representative of the Labour Labour Labour Party explained his group was worried about "twp and Pwp rims."
For readers outside Wales: In walisical, twp means "sudden" and pwp means "besh".
A representative of the Plaid Cymru Party of Wales said that the group in its entirety was "unfortunate" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was “open” for the rename change, but noted that the MWP pronunciation is very close to the word “Muppet”, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British snake word for “dust”.
In this context, the walisian letter W is spoken in a similar way as the letter U is expressed in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a "uh" sound.
The Assembly Commission, which currently develops laws to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, it is the Members themselves who have the last provisional right in respect of the name to be mentioned."
The Government of the Act of Wales 2017 authorized the Walesian National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support to rename the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlament Members), but the option MWP was most supported during the public consultation.
Representatives suggest some other alternatives, but to make all parties come to an agreement can lead to the headbreak of President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, will provide a legislative draft for the change of name in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee system.
The representatives have the last voting right to what they should be called when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians go to the election clocks to determine whether the country's name should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade of dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the Northern Neighbour's name is a requirement in their territory and has, on several occasions, opposed its application for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum for the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay for participation in the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's styles – the crickets in Harlem are struggling
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on each corner," says Adams.
"Now there is none of the parts."
He said the bar's apostasy was understandable.
He says: "Folk are socially associated in other ways."
‘Bars are no longer meeting places of the local environment, which all visit regularly.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe, 'and before or later they are back at the starting point.'
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who do not want to help the remaining places of the neighborhood.
“The majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors forever, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boikott by dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem’s principal handmasters — because they did not hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 made great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s covenants planned for the reconstruction, they bought in a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was “the church clocks of the poor people.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural tax” and“ an inevitable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that was played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the past few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are introduced by the church's play leadership and other of the bishop.
The church council — the leadership of the congregation, consisting of laymans — wrote to the Bishop in July about its concern that the Bishop would “try to force the cost ” of the church council, despite the fact that the church council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some patriarchs complained about lack of openness from the Bishop's side.
Hai hurts thirteen-year-old on hummer diving in California
A shark attacked and hurt a 13 - year - old boy when he ducked after cums in California on Saturday, the first day of the hummer season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had ducked with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy cried out of enthusiasm about catching a hummer, but he gradually realized that the boy cried 'I was bite!
I was biten!"
His whole bone was ripped up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water'," added Hammel.
The boy was transported with air ambulance to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
The type of shark that performed the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most people are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make their intake on the British beauty care market.
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrug and Debenham's with warehouse-like make-up and beauty shelves, crewd by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are tested in 11 stores throughout the country as part of a strong entrance in the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which is constantly growing while the sales numbers of clothes and home articles fall. If the attempt proves successful, the concept will be expanded to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempt to find a new use of the place used earlier for TVs, microwave and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer for 3000 products, including marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the shop has never sold before.
Existing product committees from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better place in marked brand areas, as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relanses its Boutique sminking mark with mainly vegan products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the parfume dealer The Fragrance Shop has to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local daily stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, has said that the sales will be more and more like a warehouse, taking up the supermarket fight against cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods outside food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The last supermarket attempt to upgrade the departments of beauty and pharmaceutical products failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the cooperation was resolved after a dispute about the distribution of income from the pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 shop pharmaceuticals to Celesio, owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan, by adding a selection of luxury-out-marine brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelves to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained associates who are so ready to provide advice and help.
Our brand committee is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting environment and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor representing a new trade experience.”
Peter Jones is "awning" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million.
The Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is supposed to be angry after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home and accessories, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s mark, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is program manager in This Morning announced at Instagram that she leaves the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand for the last seconds to focus on his own new golden contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “awning” at an excited meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where the golden girl here admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time for their clothing and accessories, Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brandware, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced at Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left Britain on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was undoubtedly the first priority for Holly.
It was a long - term investment that would give her financial security in the next decades.
Everyone is totally shocked by her choosing to leave.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse of goods is standing at the Marlow headquarters, which is now ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning program manager, which is among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost the company millions of pounds because of large investment in products such as pussy and light,mote and cosmetic clothes, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp in the last ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has 40% shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to be M&S trademark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin, hosting the I'm A Celebrity I'm.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
The facts "and so we loved ourselves"
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media for having made a comment that some would consider “little presidentlike” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
Trump said in his imitation of a news anchor.
"I have not given away anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a big dirt on the way to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly said on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “correspondent response” from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States still has sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a congregation of his choosers.
"We're doing very good with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has resulted in positive results, such as stopping rakets, helping to release hostages and to get the remains sent home after U.S. officials.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who try to get into this stepped stage, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” said Trump and pointed to the area right ahead.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia raze a island and kill hundreds of people
In the refrigerator of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of more than 10% of Lombox’s residents’ homes, no national disaster was declared, a requirement for international assistance.
"In many cases they have, unfortunately, made it clear that they do not ask for international help. so it is quite challenging," explained Sumbung.
The fear of the children now sets together a team to travel to Palu, but is still not sure whether foreign associates will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Crisis Management Council, said that Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are to be allowed to contribute to the assistance work.
In view of the constantly exposed earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is terriblely poorly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
To protect from tsunamis, they are built in Aceh, but they are not a common vision along other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a warning circuits in Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has likely contributed to death numbers.
Even in the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrading of Indonesia’s falling infrastructure to a key point in his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and the railway.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joco’s administration, which will be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarist tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have moved to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machites, arrows, arches, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in the fight against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting for 89 minutes in the game at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high over the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can be done, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kantte come and touched the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it on."
Chelsea led with 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a measure for 25 minutes.
The Blues attack player sent a passport with the heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he changed direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic delivered a fast survival on the midway.
Then he fired a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left-foot kick by Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the Champions League group game at 15 a.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European Liga in football for men in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
The deaths of the Tsunami in Indonesia reach 832
The death rates after Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami have increased to 832, announced the National Crisis Management Office early on Sunday.
It was reported that many were caught in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves of up to six meters, explained Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with materials from rashed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been drawn into the dispute of 'rewritten history'
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures that were carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as “foolish” and “a attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a goal.
The iconoclasm of the British Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the error Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 18th century's opinions and is part of the history of a man many believe still deserve to be celebrated.
Goldsmith explained The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps late in the 18th century than today, as Parliament’s defense against pressure from outside – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
If this is an absolutely accurate representation, it is still the subject of historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognized figure representing one side of that conflict.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and memorizing."
Killing Gris kills Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the southwest China market, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only with the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered by blood from a ripped pulse year near a bowl on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to place vaccines on pigs on a farm 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, the province of Qinghai, China.
It seems that he had traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig path was open.
He said there was a big wrong thing with blood on his mouth inside the pigs.
According to the report, a judicial medical investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maltracted” explained the cousin, mentioned with the surname Wu, in a quote for Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan went to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Yuan wasn't his or his cousin.
While the police gathered evidence from the scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and the market's leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for death.
Although it happens to the source, it is not the first time a pig has attacked people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts and caused the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a walisian farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer’s wife managed to chase the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the usual but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You only have to show sufficient respect."
The rest of the orcan Rosa will lead to strong rain in the southwest of the United States.
As reported, the orcan Rosa is weakened by moving over the colder sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring flood rain on her journey through northern Mexico and southwestern America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a orchestra of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trap begins to be formed over the Pacific and moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Baja California half-eye on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the next few days, the tropical moisture and the trap nearby will lead to widespread rain in the southwest.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, floating rushs and rapid and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Diptropical moisture will lead to rain rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in certain areas, especially areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert to the foot as long as there is danger to tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause rivers to become wide showers, and thunder will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The trap nearby will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible and this can lead to floating rush and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the first rainfall of the area.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
October can lead to intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic becomes colder but the troops remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We will see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the Central America on Sunday.
There will be nearly 11 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high in the twenty from Southern Plains to parts of the North Eastern America.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that Eastern America most likely will have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, so the Thursday's gripping witness from High Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political feast continued, and broadcasters interrupted their ordinary missions to advertise the great surprise of Friday in the last second when it came to the discovery that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to carry out a weekly investigation of the accusations.
Ford told the Senate court committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take off her clothes at a youth school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20,4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average seer number for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seertal was not directly available to other networks that showed the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the ninion usually has problems with measuring office overseers.
In order to give a little perspective, this number of viewers corresponds to the final game of the American football championship or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose advocates have supported Kavanaugh's appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with an average seer number of 5.69 million for the fortune hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interests were still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main person of Friday's drama.
The moderate republic's office gave a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's forefront. Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted and shouted against him.
He stood with lower eyes for minutes while he was scolded, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells our land the truth?"
He heard that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made an opinion, and when the lift doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the consultations directly several hours later, when the Court Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination was to be forwarded to the entire Senate for vote.
But Flake said he was willing to do this only if the FBI examined the accusations against the candidate within the next week, as the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake’s choices had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans had not enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to investigate the accusations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of 'political game' around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU to drive “political gambling” with the future of Britain and undermine the interests of the nation.
The United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued its attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a suggestion that Britain and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs were "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrests Dyteon Simpson, which is suspected to have caused the LSU player's death.
The police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and sentenced for deliberate murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost their glasses during the basket roof.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His deposit is set to USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The court medicine in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a shot in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for their work group for the collection of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local population for contributions to the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's athlete leader Joe Alleva thanked the District Police for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer Will Wade said that the team is "knust" and "in shock" after Waydes' death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ashes over Mexico City
The ash that sprays out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern vicinity layers of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s government for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the crater’s activity and 183 emissions of gas and ash were registered within one day.
The level monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Pictures of social media showed a thin layer of ash covering front routes on cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysics have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a earthquake of 7.1 shaking central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants of independence had a collaboration with the police, while thousands of people participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on release.
A group of masked separatists was retained by the rebellion police, bombing them with eggs and powder painting, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
The arms also broke out later on the day when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For hours, independence protesters stood and cried “Now forget, never forgive”, face to face with Unionist protesters who cried “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, 14 persons were treated for less injuries they received during the protests.
The excitement is still high in the release-oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming number of liberation, but it was a bad encounter because the vote was boikotted by most opposed to liberation.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at election stations throughout the region.
Liberation groups put on camps in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
Still, the demonstration was stopped, but forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s ability to become independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents cry out of joy in getting voice, but now we're stuck, ” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalonian independence have had difficulties with maintaining the pressure this year, since many of their allegedly known leaders have traveled in exile or are in storage while waiting for a trial for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was encountered by politicians on both sides.
"The situation becomes more and more stressed," he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned for a trial since late last year, announced that he was to make elections in the European Parliament next year.
“To be a candidate for the European election is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and the regression of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19.30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the event had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A arm breast may also have been fired against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston 1-0 victory against Rangers.
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Livinston was astonished by Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 fights as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good meeting from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side still hasn't won on the highway in Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, which are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Vienna in the European Liga on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained unovertaken through six fights in the division, and Chief Holt has not lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for his slumsy guests.
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, when their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after cutting into to meet Craig Halkett head past the target.
The host let Rangers play ahead, well aware that they could make problems for their guests at deathball.
And that was how the decisive goal came.
Rangers left a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated in order to give Menga a clear course, and he scored a target from the middle of the box.
Within this stage, the Rangers had the ball mostly all the time, but the defense of the home team had proved to be inconsistent and the target guard Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos performed a nearest score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers-keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a short pass.
Cruises constantly entered the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two punishment requirements – once after Halkett's protest against Glenn Middleton, and once by hand – were ignored.
‘Fenomenal’ from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing, and they continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got back to the top, but Holt will have a lot of the honor of how he has strengthened his crew after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a huge well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes up through the whole game.
On the other hand, Rangers did not have my inspiration to divorce.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they were unable to comply with this standard.
The last part of the battle was labs — they got into the homework half once — and it was a little of a resurrection for Rangers, located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Köln
Everything was just a smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visits to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a distinction between matters such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police stated security as the reason why a 25,000 people were not allowed to gather themselves before the mosque, but many followers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them curators — also gave up, criticizing both Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to let him in the country.
Conflicting demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is celebrated as a whole of some German Turks and hated as an autocracy of others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in car collision.
A cyclist was killed in a collision like with a personnel car in London.
The collision took place in the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the bicycle was treated by an ambulance staff, but the man died in the place.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a ride where the driver escaped from the place of death in Children’s Street, about one kilometer from Saturday’s collision.
Metropolitan Police said that the police are working on identifying the man and notifying the relatives.
Road blocks and bus drives are placed, and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six cops injured in rebellion
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Revolutions broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday, and still on.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been downloaded to handle the event, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one fly.
The officers were treated for smaller facial injuries in the place.
A prison minister said: “Special prison staff has been sent in to deal with an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – those responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind locks and hits."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after an inmate had attacked.
And in October last year, the rebellion police was invited to deal with a serious incident where employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be favorable for drying areas)
It is the source of Arizona, which is hit by a tropical iprint, but it will probably happen early next week, as the residual power of the orkaan Rosa moves through the desert areas of the southwest and brings floods.
National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into the southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that “non ten tropical cycles have maintained the status as tropical storm or lprint within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.”
The last National Hurricane Center models foresee 5-10 cm rainfall, with up to 15 cm in some places in Mongollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the desert in the southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, will likely be between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from dryness.
Although flood is a serious problem, some of this downturn will probably be favorable, since the southwest of the United States is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, some over 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa hits land at the Mexican peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has the storm force on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind strength of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and thus loses power.
Thus, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storms on Monday evening or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be strong and lead to a great flood.
‘Total rainfall of 7,5 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the border to Arizona gryday morning as a tropical lprint, which moves through Arizona and into the southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The chief father expected by Rosa or the rest of it is a very severe rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States, ” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This defeat is expected to produce life - threatening floods and fluids and rapidly in the desert and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four assaults for murder attempts.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of murder attempts, after a 16-year-old was found a knife stuck in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton around 04:00 BST on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition is supposed to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked everyone who can have mobile records of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered in the minority and mind of the democratic party.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the reluctant and shocking tactics of the democratic party," said Trump in front of a national meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered "under the minority and mind" of the democratic party through the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday, and denied strongly and emotionally the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed sexual abuse against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also witnessed about his accusation during the hearing.
On Saturday the president said that "the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with a spotless vanity in public service,” he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreet to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the republics' votes at the interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
“This is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that the democratics are aimed at “motstanding and preventing”.
The first interim vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were dragged to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami met the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves thundered in land around the sunset, destroyed everything in their way, and drowned many.
The tsunami came into the heels of a earthquake with strength 7.5.
“When the tsunami father appeared yesterday, people were still running activities on the beach, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesia’s Crisis Management Office (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“ The tsunami wasn’t alone — it drove cars, tribes and houses, it met everything on land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to flee from the tsunami and survived."
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management system showed many ruined buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be known by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) stated that the force from Friday’s huge earthquakes was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bucket may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the stage.
Nugroho described the damage as “wide ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres, and hotels have crashed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found captured in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death rates and damages can be the larger coast of the country 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, close to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication from Donggala, according to Nugroho, was completely depressed.
There are more than 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a press report, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may become much worse."
On Saturday, the stage was strongly criticized for not informing us that a tsunami had met Palu, but the authorities stated that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared in social media, a man at the upper floor of a building is hearing desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passing on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes thundering to the beach and rivers buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a huge power break that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
According to the authorities, the military has started to send transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people are still desperately in need of food and other needs.
The city's airport is only open for help work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia rise over 800.
It's terrible.
World Vision’s staff from Donggala have come safely to the Palu center, where they have searched for shelter at the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me that they saw hundreds of ruined houses," he said.
It's terrible.
As helping organizations began the dysty preparations for disaster aid, some complained that foreign assistants with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared to be a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a province disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says "All right, this is a national disaster", we can open the limits of international assistance, but the situation has not yet been statused."
When the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquakes and tsunami hopes friends and family of those who are still missing for their loved ones to be among the miracle stories that light up the dark news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was released by rescue crews after spending two days under ruins with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglids for the Asian games, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional ought to bear," he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the operators who attended the Palu beach festival.
But the messages resulted only in grey hake marks, rather than a few blue hake marks.
"I think that means that the messages weren't delivered," he said.

Canye West: The Rapper changes his name to Ye
The raper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of its eighth album, launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the songer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on “emotional basis,” according to the series creator.
In addition to being a shortening of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.”
He's one of many known rappers who've changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varyed between the use of bonds and large letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use military against civilians.
Mexico's attendant president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sweared that he will never use military power against civilians, when the country is nearing the 50th anniversary of bloody represal to students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on Tlatelco Plaza that he will “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people”.
Military troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on the square of October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-political student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths into criminal gangs.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use in research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance that the next great performance in artificial intelligence comes from the United States," said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that hit the US's best Othello player, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or Director of Google's Chinese department.
Lee recognized the former technology competitions of the U.S. government, as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to help find the smart heads of the next generation.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state grants.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should receive offers of residence permit automatically,” he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligency in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people from academic institutions,in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations, spending money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Previously this year, the United States Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
With regard to NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. law aiming to establish a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a Sunday referendum on whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia in order to resolve a decade of dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, who also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour is a demand in Greek territory, and has laid down veto to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new navy, but nationalist opposers argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s slave majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boikottating campaign has created doubts about the meeting will meet the minimum 50 percent requirement, which is mandatory for the voting to be valid.
The question of the voting note is: ‘Is you for NATO and EU membership in approving the agreement with Greece?’
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that occurred after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective paraply, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive because a high number of Members of Parliament have said they will observe the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 a.m.
Yet, the meeting was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their voice.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong to Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko votes in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before the House in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by the boikotte voters.
“We are positive to the NATO and the EU, but we want to be reported with a high head, not let into the back,” says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our worth.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of European integration.”
Minister Zaev says NATO's membership will lead the very necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our inhabitants want us to be a member of the EU and NATO,” says Zaev after voting.
He says that a "yes" answer will be a "proof of our future".
According to a questionnaire published by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of the voting eligible will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the meeting required.
Another study, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the blacks are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle to the pro-West government since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero manoeuvres by the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a target for 65 minutes.
The Argentine attack player received a passport at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran around with three Brighton defenders before he got out on an open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defense before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attack player used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to hit Brightons Holder Matthew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
“Aguero still has some foot problems,” told the city manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
“We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky he scored a target right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League fight.
This target came for 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in the Brighton territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he brought Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attack player sent the ball into the net right before it was over the deadline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always equally competitive Scherzer hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff possibilities of the Colorado team, who leads the Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 victory over National's Friday evening, but still wants to secure their first division title.
Even if we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of battle I'll play this year.
Why should I not take part in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced its launching pitchers for Sunday, but must seem to be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullet session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 fights and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 rounds.
Trumps People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around the Supreme Courtnominated Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of the republics to vote at the interim elections.
“All the things we have done are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I'm going around and fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this horrible, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happen right now.
And they are determined to take back power at any price, and there you see the tinyness and evilness.
They don't care who they hurt, whoever they have to overrun for power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give it to them."
The democratics, he said, are aimed at "opposing and preventing".
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sune and bad and dishonest and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate’s Court Committee and mentioned the democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, on which the audience was very loudly built.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I expect one – it was a very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinions
When momentum activists in my local party voted to sensure me, there was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last one in a wide range of Labour parliamentary members who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be sensured because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar things that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
At the Nottingham East Labour report on Friday, it stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the atmosphere of many of the meetings, and the promise of 'maturer, friendly' policy is far too forgotten if it at all ever began.
It becomes increasingly clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Worker Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought that I shared many political attitudes with suddenly began to expect I to take an U-swing and stand in the opinions I had never previously agreed on, they ended with the security of the nation or the internal market of the European Union.
When I speak publicly — and it has nothing to say what I say — I receive a lot of horrible news in social media that requires me to be disposed of, condemns center politics and tells me that I should not be part of Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
I know I'm more lucky with some of my colleagues, because the comments I receive are usually political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sexually discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be cowped.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how severe excretion has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the worker party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every mistrust proposal and any change in the rule of election will smaler the party.
I've received many advice in the last two years where I'm encouraged to keep my head low and not to raise my voice so much, because it's going to do everything better.
But that's not why I engaged in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher Government, which had led my classroom in the public school I was literally falling off, I have struggled for better public services for those who need them most, both as local council and government minister.
I have never hided my political opinions, neither in the previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political attitudes or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who presented the representative proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country rushs our way against a Brexit who will harm private persons, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and powers on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to communicate is not for Nottingham Momentum – it is for those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat of deliberation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think is best to keep your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconsumed Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazing entertaining Tennent's Premiership fight.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only uncatched by the ten.
Finally, their superior defense was as much as their ability to use the possibilities that led to the victory of their home team, and trainer Peter Murchie had good reason to be content.
"We have been challenged in our battles so far and are still undefeated, so I must be happy with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honour to Ayr, they were better to use the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's attempts for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the leadership, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, made Melrose outstanding position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a penalty park before, just before a break, he scored and targeted a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the other half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's attempts, with a target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This became a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the bears, and from the restart, Ayr's leadership increased even more oath a trial from Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayr’s functioning captain, Blain Macpherson, then received yellow card and Melrose exploited a extra man on the board to the fullest with a attempt from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
Yet the home team came back strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to have handled Climo when he hadn't the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the entrance behind the producing Ayr wall.
Climo achieved a target park, as he did almost completely from the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's boxing park and sent Flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth of the home team's attempts.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game Star Ford Kieran is on the way into the servering industry – it was recently discovered that he is named as director of a restaurant company with a gift grant.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program for which he writes and plays with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The Due has announced that the coming nineth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that the Kiernan now plans the life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress would not comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow’s “living restaurant industry”.
"The port is ours": Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Seafarers patrol a riggined marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public building lifts a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicaca lake to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: “We have right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
The whole country of Bolivia has still fresh in memory the coastal line they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 1800s, and the country longs for once again to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be larger than they have been for decades, waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has driving power, community spirit and peace of mind, and of course expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on a large screen in many places of the country, in the hope that the Haag Court will make its decision before Bolivia’s claim that Chile — after decades of trackadic negotiations — is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president — faced with a controversial re-electing campaign next year — has also devoted much to the decision of Monday.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
However, some analytics believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia’s party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which was held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away chilenian lands, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard, says Paz Zárate, a chilenian expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years may have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has lost any remaining goodwill on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative of the Hague, rejected the theory that the Court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will give “a extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation’s relations with Chile” and the possibility to “stop 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties”.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales — which is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — has used the maritime situation as a political shell.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific”, he added.
"The teaching is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never devastate its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with their promises during a meeting between the leaders of the two conflicting countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be ready to start the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "wish dream" of continuing sanctions and American opposition against is the declaration that will ever end the Korean war will force North Korea into the knees.
The U.S. authorities are skeptical to accept the declaration without that Pyongyang first introduces significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want another meeting.
However, there are widespread doubts about whether Pyongyang really plans to release a arsenal country is likely to view as their only security guarantee.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mote shows in Paris reveals the last in huge headache, which is on the way to a clothing store close to you
If you want some major additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne deducted a selection of extraordinary, over-dimensional head plaques as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel trees of the motel in Paris.
Very unpractical hats have been popular at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye - out creatures down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most spectacular clothing was an excessive beige hat decorated with a featherlike wide brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other superdimensional accessories included jeweled water melons, a trollman’s hat or even ananas, but they are not designed to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also deducted a selection of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had restored lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last cry.
One creation reminded of diving equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cookies.
And if you're looking for even more fashionable accessories, you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be on the way to a clothing store close to you.
The over-dimensional hats come straight into the heels of La Bomba, the strain hat with a half-metre wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractical hat dominated by social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk — a beach bag that is almost as large as the bathing suit model that wears it.
The orange rape bag, which is edged with raw fibres and complete with a white skin handle, was the most eye-looking creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at the moteuka in Paris.
Knowledge styleist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see great hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a great impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for superdimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland’s fresh oils continue to show academic excellentness, and this has continued in 2018 with more than one year’s excellent degree results. These are supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social actions.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As a educational body that can design and implement a high school course, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanded choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when his head's words.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words come to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can not just stay in English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the exam results of the year, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest resistance percentages from fresh oils.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the graduation class A.
The data, collected from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council, showed that 72 percent of students received the graduate A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that fresh oils in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a decisive skills for children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as vocational choices are now appreciated at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics at the pensum for fresh oils and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, for the reasons of employers reported to have problems in occupational occupation, 17 percent could be attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become more and more important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language knowledge, these skills become decisive in a globalized world.
If you have learned another language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive progress.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
Learning more languages, especially those associated with growing economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered most valuable for Britain on the road towards 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose between fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scotian fresh oils aim to create a learning environment that will prepare their children and equipped them with the knowledge and ability they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are constantly decisive for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as ‘international communication capacity’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity, and excellentness for Scotland’s youths.
I want the bees to be fair.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is almost faced with fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the Sunday pre-season opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not definite.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After a exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-season plan.
"I don't need pre-seasonal matches in this stage of my career," he replied.
Time for Trump's National Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President starts a number of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five planned national meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation of his chosen High Court candidate is awaited, Trump aims to obtain support for the coming interim elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control over the congress when the voters go to the voting hours in November.
When's Trump's West Virginia people's meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's people's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will start after plan at 19.00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's people's meeting in West Virginia online below via direct flowing at YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the week's hearings for High Court-Nominated Brett Kavanaugh, which is accused of sexual abuse.
The main objective of all these referendums is to support republics faced with a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore stated that these five national meetings in the next few weeks are aimed at “firing volunteers and supporters as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Reuters”, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so decisive for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we move towards a busy campaign season”, Reuters heard by a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The evening's referendum, which will take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and covered by the Pittsburgh press", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month of Trump visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Western Virginia's republic Senate Candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is on the point of view.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a vow on the measurements,” said Simon Haeder, an expert in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to keep faith as they enter the Sunday single game
After three unilateral increases, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may have been exactly what the year’s Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum’s swinging pendel is a completely poemed sports concept, but yet what players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led with six points and now there are four, so we probably wear it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the path.
Of course, Europe wants the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 remaining to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have had a little wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent game from tea to green, and leads by example.
The deep cries of celebration became higher as his round continued, and sink to a decisive putting to raise the match to the level when he and Thomas were two under two.
His putting, who won them the match of 15, was met with a similar scream — of the kind that shows that he still does not think the U.S. team is chanceless.
“We really have to put all the clutches to and focus on our own match,” said Spieth.
That's all this player has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have gained more scores than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which undoubtedly are Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe’s unusual but glorious couples have four out of four and do not make a foot mistake.
“Moliwood ” was the only couple that avoided a bookey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided Bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are the largest competitors of Sunday, and no other players will see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everybody prefers both at the same time, in each of their holes.
Still, it is too early to declare Europe as the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily kicked up with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bookey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swedish were so far in defence that they did not have nubbejans to recover.
But on Sunday there is no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as teams so far, and lies far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team USA has the battle spirit of some, especially in the United States, has missed.
Europe heads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advance at the start of Ryder Cup's last day, after finishing the Sunday fourball and foursomes matches with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised its score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the accidental side of America in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they did not get back any of the foregoing.
Jim Furyk's side has to get eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that has received four points in a row, and he and Molinari – together called “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup’s history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated insultlessly to strike broken Woods and the American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with even more emphasized 5&4.
Woods, who halted through two matches on Saturday, shined in between, but now lost 19 of their 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevens in foursomes and achieved a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka, ranged as number one and three worldwide.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light brise southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won Major's three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fighting 2&1 victory over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup’s history, a team has been able to get in after a four-point pre-speaking at the beginning of the single game, but as present holders only need Furyk’s side to achieve the equality to keep the trophy.
But after being the next best for two days, they do not seem to be able to deliver a counter attack on Saturday.
North Korea will "in no way" agree to unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that sanctions continued strengthening mistrust against the United States, and that the country will in no way agree to unilaterally release its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out "a significant welcoming measures" during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, demonstrating the nuclear testing area and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have not yet seen any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not under any circumstances unilaterally disarmament ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance against a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament steps, but his statement was important because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint declaration issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the 'atom disarmament of the Korean peninsula', while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal conclusion of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international penalties against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘atom disarmament first’ and lifts the pressure through penalties to achieve its goal forcefully, and opposes even ‘the declaration of the end of war’’, according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us into our knees is a dream of desire for people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae during the last five months, and added: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Half Island would not have been as locked up as it is.”
The tone for Ris' speech was still very different from the last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the United States of Mainland with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Here evil President" Trump called Kim a "railetman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to 'complete destruction' of North Korea last year, Trump stood before the United Nations and commended Kim to be courageous enough to take the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclear devastated.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a timeframe for this, saying, "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The Sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced strongly and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to knock the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side lines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip wasn't good.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after the accusation of North Korea, he had come with "passing demands".
North Korea committed itself to a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile area and a nuclear plant if the United States did “corresponding measures”.
He said Kim had said that these "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard course to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course will help students to get more sleep by dealing with the growing uncultural choppers in the night with coffee imprints as fuels.
One academic found out that the best university students in the world often did not know how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep shortage on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came to me, and said, "Why has no one said this before?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which begins this year, explains the importance of good sleeping habits in order to be academic and sporting, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Adm. dir. of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to start the course after seeing the students suffering from serious sleep shortage.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, gardins, jogging shoes, and books, and hear about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortage and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In another part, participants learn how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in being able to pump all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students led to a growing problem of sleep deficiency.
Enough sleep should be the student’s “secret weapons ” against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even as a means of weight increase, when sleep deficiency puts the brain in famine, which leads to constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, and took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm when they were to lie as well as when they were to rise, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disturb the rhythm of the day and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Targets of Menga kills Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered a loss when Dolly Mengas target hit Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss on 18 matches that manager and left behind since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to compensate.
Rangers now fall to the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind Hibernian on target differences.
There may be more trouble in the yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown out of the remote public.
Gerrard made eight substitutes on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup-semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart’s last week, and he would have enjoyed how his well - trained team struck the opponents.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more about it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes in the game when Menga's first passport sent Scott Pittman through at Allan McGregor's target, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long freezer park of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game had more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty park after a quarter when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson denied this.
Rangers only managed two shots at targets at the first time, but former Ibrox Sergeant Liam Kelly didn't get any problems with Lassana Coulibalys head and a tough kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opened for 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserve it for the struggle.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get the remote players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the leadership in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
I'm sure the Rangers investor Glenn Middleton had a late claim for a penalty park when he ended up in conflict with Jacobs, but again Thomson went away.
Almanacs: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning Almanak: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the goat counter.
The Geiger teller has been an important part of science since then, and also became a part of the popular culture through the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “It's a goat counter, and it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms of radioactiveness in the minerals.”
Evans: "Say it sounds now."
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he gave name to live on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccin learns the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can “see” a protein that is common in many cancers and then be injected again in the patient
A vaccine during test has had promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered disappeared for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many cancers, and then reinject these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drivs growth of different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, where immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to address cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Canye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with strong defense of Trump after the SNL action.
It didn't go well.
Canye West was built in a studio at Saturday Night Live after a familiar act in which he praised American President Donald Trump and said he would make elections in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again-hatt, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I speak to a white person, and then he says, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fool of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded into social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had heard it in the back room about the choice of headache.
"They mobbed me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They mobbed me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see that I understand what the reality is?" He said, "Will he take on me the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love."
His comments were built at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked ashamed, Variety, where a staff member said: “The whole studio became deadly.”
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song "I Love It" dressed like a Perrier-water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of our most courageous: TAKE FOR YOU TAKE IN THE IMOT MASSES."
But Talkshowvert Karen Hunter twittered that West is just "the one he is and it's totally amazing".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”) which I mean to cultivate and spray out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the raper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, and he said that from now on he was "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who's changing his name and now follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The raper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion, and then, of course, it's the deceased musical legend Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington's outwards against "reliable masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the Swordswinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent imagination series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31 - year - old actress has gone out and criticized the stereotypy of the macho hero and says such roles in movies often cause young men to think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic maskulinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, stated that he was very interested in the theme.
“ I’m quite worried at the moment — where did the masculinity go wrong? ” he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic masculinity" due to the strong masculine roles.
He continued: “What is inborn and what is given?
What is distributed on TV and streets, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this part of being a man?
I think it is one of the really big questions today — how can we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any precursor or successor of Game of Thrones when the series is finished next summer, and he says he is “finished with battlefields and horses.”
From November Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so there came something good out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy prize-rewarded imagination series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of a total of 14% in populations living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says the health representative.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who get HIV in this way is now closer to zero, Chinese health staff at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease infections are due to inadequate protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a action to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that collaborator leaked data on republic senators, fnices of ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘conspiration theories’
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday charges that members of her staff had issued personal information to three republic senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Democracy of Los Angeles assured by the claims was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
“Løgns, liars and more absurd lies,” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, issued by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate on the accusations against High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the article was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely unfair and a regular lie," continued Waters.
“The members of my staff who have received their identitys, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely unfair and a regular lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that she has not the right temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
You can't defend them.
Don't doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and understanding."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being aggressive during Thursday's consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the interference elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Sort – if it's true," he twittered.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned “relevant authorities and police about these false accusations.”
“We will ensure that the actors are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Blood poor Rowan Atkinson in spy parodi
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit references in all new films with a British snap and it seems to be present for this reliving of the parodifranchisen Johnny English action comedie – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self - satisfaction about how obviously hopeless we have become the nation’s new export product?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bubbling eyes and the gummian view has made his license renewed to rot it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure designed in territories with non-English-speaking kinopublikum.
He is of course the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a doughnut Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one note in the music embedded with firecar theme during the opening ceremony at the London Olympics 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the longest forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in the latest Johnny English ride.
I loved how Johnny English approached a medieval armor helicopter and the rotor leaves sneaked his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent of physical comedie comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely excessive, especially now as the “serious” brands that 007 and Mission Incapsible willingly away have elements of comedie.
The humor seems to be more directed to children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and spit as the stumbling films of Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrate the British supersecret web network of spys and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guardian agent – an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop of a Prime Minister, a pompous and depressed figure that is already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this as-Teresa-May role, but the manus does not give her much to work with.
Her informants inform that since each active spy has been revealed, she has to pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clowned Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbed etablissement, but gives inofficial education in secret information, there are some artful sequences here when English offers a rocka academy of spy activity.
English is captured back to Whitehall for a fast orientation and reunited with his old, plagued helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine commander, a hysterical superclass lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of rotting everything to on the Queen's mission are back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the luxurious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with farshes side jump: predressed as servitors, they fire a splendid French restaurant, creating chaos while they hide on board in Volta's luxury yacht; and English tries to use a VR headset to make themselves known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but yet so loving and noisy it's so much like children's TV with the whole thing.
Very medium-sized, all of it.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't just think: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they work out plans to let the British work four days week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will evaluate a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but get paid for five.
The party apparently wants business leaders to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekly day free.
This will result in a three - day celebration of employees, while they receive the same wage.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in front of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that fits the party’s desire to let the pencil turn to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the Parliamentary election in 2017.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A speaker of Labour said, "A four-day week is not the party's policy, and is nothing that is considered by the party."
The Labour Counsellor, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from "unintentional directors" and "profits" of public service providers.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also means that current actors in water companies are in danger of not getting the whole share item back because a Labour government can do "deduction" based on unfairness.
He also confirmed the plans of placing workers in the corporate governance and setting up an employee fund to transfer 10 % of the capital of the private sector companies to employees, which may receive an annual profit of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind.
The FBI investigation of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has issued a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of the Agency's finding may make some republic senators change view.
In an interview sent on Sunday, Correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than the South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the accusations came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, definite, clear.
However, Graham’s voice seems to be cut in stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it must be an intriguing finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energyfully," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And none of those she mentioned could not confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to fighting poverty?
This Saturday is New York for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; eliminating world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will make thousands of people flow to the great plenary of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase consciousness about the real goal of destruction extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group hoping to fight poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions” such as voluntary work, send emails to a world leader, take a telephone or in other meaningful ways to increase awareness about their goals of eliminating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when it is only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to make people fight for changes, or just a case of so - called “clicktivism” - that people feel that they contribute greatly by signing a signature campaign on the Internet or sending a Tweet?
The Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million “actions” from the followers, with a well of different goals.
They say that these actions have helped world leaders to declare obligations and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could show 390 commitments and announcements due to their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main enthusiasts are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in Britain to “help children to exploit their full potential” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 seconds from the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and the Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with undernutrition a footnote in history”, told the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, “What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important citizens' rights and the anti-aparteide movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is some of the artists acting at the year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy sports - the Minister of Industry
Washington can, if necessary, take action to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the US Interior Minister, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when they operate on the invitation of the legal government — is a suggestion to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the Southern Flank of Europe,” he would have said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
“The U.S.A. has the opportunity to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary blocks to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organization that profiles itself as “the voice of the energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are far on the road.
“The economic option to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel”, he said and referred to Russia as “one trick pony” with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration has been on a round trip to strengthen the export of its floating natural gas to Europe; they want to replace Russia, the most cheap alternative for European consumers.
Therefore, employees of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘unappropriate’ project The North European Gas Management 2, which according to Trump made Berlin the ‘catch’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Northern European gas management is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas management capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s glowing resistance to the project is just motivated for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier”, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the U.S. Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met opposition from Germany, which has re-estimated its obligations in the project.
Germany's leading organization of industry, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have major problems with third countries that intervene in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the BDI after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to think seriously on his president's candidate for 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusett, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" whether she would be a president's candidate after the interrogations.
During a choosing meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wants to stop.
“It is time for women to get to Washington and fix the shocked government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said,“ says The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'd like to think seriously about whether I should be a president's candidate."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he was "having the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried until the margin of what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI review before the vote."
However, a review published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stand, according to a opinion measurement by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The measurement showed higher support to former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% were against it.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidate tour in 2020 are among others Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he wanted to decide officially by January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Track Palins PTSD during Trump's election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being sept.
He was arrested and sentenced for a home violence event on Monday evening.
“What my son goes through, what he’s going through after coming home, I have shared with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers,” she told the audience at a choosing arrangement for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said about the son and other war veterans:“They come home a little changed, they come home the herd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect of what their soldiers and pilots and all other military members have contributed to the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and sentenced for violence at home to a woman, causing a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a police officer in Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support testing of new asylum policies
The eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum to victims flying from gang or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. submitted an information from Amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged policy, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in Grace v. the sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union announced in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent gangster’s sons” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations who have vigorous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision by the Anchor Court of Migrants who allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "sees away from many decades of state, federal and international law".
‘Food law requires that all asylum requirements be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle’, said the orientation of Amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refused immigrants to access damages the American economy and says that they are very likely to become founders and "done with the necessary labour."
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asyl is available to those who leave the country of origin due to persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view," said Sessions in the announcement of 11 June on policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – death numbers are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse.
“ It was very excited, ” says the 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever - sick son at an evacuation center in the most accumulated city of Palu.
"The whole time you see ambulances that get the dead.
Pure water is inadequate.”
One could see people coming to ruined homes and relief through water - damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were hurt, and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake with strength 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus’s military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe aftercrows.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recalls how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We had no time to save ourselves in security.
I was knocked by the wall that crashed, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to participate in a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘tracassing’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
One week after a Chinese public newspaper driving a four - page ad in an American newspaper that painted the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China in Beijing accused of using American presses to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex to China Daily paid to enter Des Moines Registry — the most selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6, a accusation of China rejects.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the elections in the United States marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said the American officials, Reuters.
Although it is normal that foreign authorities use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in a escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new customs rates on each other’s imports.
China's penalty duty early in the trade war was to affect export companies in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China, and former many - year governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in the Sunday Des Moines Register: "China now steps up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“As a contrast – at the newspaper on the street here in Beijing, you do not find many different opinions and do not experience real reflections among common Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are under the inch of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers refused the offer to publish” his article, even though he did not inform what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare female choosers away before the inter-election with Kavanaugh, warns analytics.
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend High Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual abuse, analytics warn that they will receive a reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings about this have been very strong, and most republics have already shown their desire to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for a FBI investigation for the last second will be enough to reassure angry chooser.
"Women will not forget the events of yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning demonstrators sang “November is coming!” while they demonstrated in the gangs of the Senate when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the witness statement from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode”, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analytist, to the news page.
“The people say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among female uncertain choosers in the premises and younger choosers between 18 and 29 years of age, which often do not vote even if they dislike the president."
Even before Ford’s public proof of sexual abuse, analytics thought that if the Republicans forced the appointment, it would be a reaction.
"This has become a happy root for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is imposed – it is also about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it”, pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities, a group that promotes the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided by who they are to believe in in the refrigerators of Ford and Kavanaugh’s witness statements, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new questionnaire from YouGov shows that 41% of those asked were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s witnesses, while 35% said that they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under their witness, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the playout from Flake, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford, plus at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate’s Judgment Committee last week that Kavanaugh was in the drunk state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while on a party during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology doctor, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the purpose is “world dominance”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses the Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data store online” or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, working lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal data store online is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorization through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should make Solid available to everyone with resources, processes and relevant competence.
The company consists at the moment of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a safety platform purchased by IBM, some introduced developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely calm overnight.

Bernard Water: celebration of Victoria Cross Recipients from World War I
The only clergyman of the English Church who was assigned to a Victoria Cors as a fighter during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Water were given honor on September 29, 1918 at the battle in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was assigned to the highest British military remark.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Water, said that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s prize - gaining production.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water Batalion led the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick thick thickness and under strong protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he crashed against the shooting line and led the line “with great courage” forward before he stormed a field cannon separately and slew out three of the departments.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just one month before the war was over.
Michael Water, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were “some I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crown after the parade, led by the body of Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Water said: “He felt very honored to play a role in the parade, ” adding: “The courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support coming from many people.”
MMAs were up all night to see the Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pigs.
Imagine that you've stayed awake all night to see the close-packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you can't see the main fight.
The attendee of San Jose succeeded in 13 fights, including six on the headcard, and was displayed directly through the night in Britain at Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the viewers of Britain were sitting down when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pigs.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to see the fight.
An advocate described the transition to the child program as “a kind of sick joke.”
“It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 a.m. so that they have to transfer to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice-president for marketing and communication, as he was asked for the mission.
"Poppy pig, yes!”
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers of Storbrtannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the contest," said Coker.
“But there is six o’clock on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe with - when we put over, there were many messages forward and back, and they weren't exactly of the kind sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was a government thing.
I can promise you this will not happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five fights — as we usually send — and we tried to stretch far for the followers, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality.
The Olympic stuper Tom Daley says he grew up with a minority feeling toward everyone because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before at the youth school he realized that “he wasn't like others.”
In the first programme of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was standing up for the rights of the homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympia.
The ordinary program manager of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, must be gone a few months because of disease.
Daley, as a little lost on Laverne's first mission, said that he felt "less worth" than anyone else he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed.”
He would prove that he “was something, ” he said, so he did not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
He is two times bronze winners in the OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, and he used his participation in the year's Munich lecture in Australia to appeal to the decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he stands up because he feels lucky who can live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times the world champion said that he was in love with a man - films Dustin Lance Black from the United States, which he met in 2013 - “was surprised me. ”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in your young age" - he took part in his first Olympia when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone in the same age who had experienced similar up- and downturns.
The couple became parents in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" had been changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about just having to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than golden medal in the Olympia.
My olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had acquired tickets to London in 2012 — since he wanted to sit first in line.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
“I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not inconquered,” he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the OL 2012 and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to stump before a home public under the Olympic, the best feeling ever, ” he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small – which meant a lot for him in the drive before the Olympic and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs goes to BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Male Mickelson took out to the golf tournament Cleaner Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47. Ryder Cup game, but he's got to get in shape if it's not gonna be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for the impressive 12 times, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and four-some fights.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, it five times the major winner shares the day between being a heavily leader and working with his game on the rank in the hope of correcting what crusts.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of the career and is not in the perfect form of the strange Le Golf National Railway, where the long rough area constantly punishes miserable battles.
And if the path itself is not scaring enough, Mickelson, in the ninth battle on Sunday, the very British Open-Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fights this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game may prove to be absolutely decisive.
Fear expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a klapp on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready next day,” said Furyk.
“He has great confidence.
He is a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these laws earlier, and this week.
I don't think he was going to play two fights.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached up to his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and seven equals, but Furyk said his participation added some immature values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, and likes to go with others, he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“ I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game."
European team captain Thomas Bjørn knows his great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows of experience that a significant leadership at the entrance of the last day’s single game in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into a unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 fight at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point leadership over the Americans, but the car at its victory with at least possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and by Valderrama, where we won, but only if,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leader 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the others in that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the scores on the tablet.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Bjørn is very pleased with how his players managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual performances are in the center, and there is something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances as a golf player are tested to the full.
It is the message you need to communicate to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players offer better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big revolts last day, and he was part of the victory team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed the “miracle at Medinah”.
I remember every damn word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had ruined his players at the entrance of the last day.
“We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a huge pressure on the middle fights.
Then we arrange our setup and send out the people in the way we feel for, you know, we're trying to create something magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top fight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the game order.
"I put on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships delayed again
The latest fregatt of the German marines should have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but it will not happen until early next year because of defective systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the drivership of the totally new fregattes in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a military speaker.
The ship would have been survived in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007 will replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-air shoots and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest fregates for up to two years away from the home port.
Still delays, however, mean that the advanced warships — they were told to give Germany strength on the sea — will already be outdated before serving, reports Die Zeit.
The destiny F125 freight created headlines last year, when German marine officially refused to drive the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of return, but the German media mentioned a number of important “software and hardware defects” that made the warship unusable in a combat mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older fregates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces performance and limits the marine’s opportunities to make upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonn heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class as were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price note of the entire project, including training of the crew, has become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a dizziness of €3.1 billion from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems around the new fregates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s maritime forces are shrinking.
Previously this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Government, confirmed that the navy actually “goes empty for the vessels of use”.
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were arranged, but no new vessels came.
He's sorry that none of the fregattes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust Thieves on the Secret Life of the Flag Muses
New research carried out by a landown in the Scotland of Scotland will reveal how flager mice use the landscape in hunting for food.
There is hope that findings will lay new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future preservatives.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common flager mice and dwarf flager mice as well as brownlancing and water flager mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flager mouse activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flager mice ropes and which species do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Protection Advisor, hopes the results will reveal the areas of the habitat most important to the flager mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the planting of pedestrians and the best care for the forest of flager mice and other associated species.
The flager Mouse population in Scotland and Britain has declined considerably through the past century.
They are threatened by construction and installation work that affects the sites and the restriction of habitats.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with fly paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as hue tax attacks.
In fact, flagermus is not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they use their ears more than their eyes to catch prey.
They use advanced ecolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flager mice very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly carry out investigations, maps of young places, and some rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only own flager mice reserve at Threave landdom in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland’s ten flager mice species.
Owner David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a perfect area for flager mice," he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still much we don't know about flager mice, so the work we do here and by other lands will help us understand more about what they need to enjoy."
He emphasizes the importance of maping the flager mice before maintaining a property since unprotected destruction of one single jungle place can kill up to 400 females and young people, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
Flag Mouse is protected, and it is illegal to kill them, torment them, or disturb them, or destroy their jungle places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish colleague of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to help in the work.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our flager mice, and for many species we simply don’t know how the population is doing.”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers are going to prosecute German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the accusations of rape against themselves as "false news" and says people "wish their fame" by using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375,000 afterwards for keeping close to the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video at Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after reporting the accusations, 33 - year - old Ronaldo rejected the accusations as “false news. ”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times the Goldball wins into the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by giving up my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm fine," the football player adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to accuse Der Spiegel for the claims, which they have called “a unacceptable production of suspects in the private sphere”, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “remembrance damage to a extent corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal protection in recent years”.
The claimed event must have occurred in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the football player’s room, where he is supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents presented to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the claimed event and told her that he was “99% a good man” who was betrayed by the “one percent”.
The documents show that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in hospitals, but later, they concluded a conciliation outside the court because she was “living afraid of vengeance ” and was also concerned about“ becoming publicly occupied. ”
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put the reconciliation aside because she's still traumatized after the reported event.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the predicted abuse, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain “will mourn forever” for losing car manufacturers
Britain 'will mourn forever' if they lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border passing by a possible Brexit without agreement could mean less jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see that production at our factory stops,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Executive Director at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they'll close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what the car manufacturers say is supply chain risks of any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of ‘order by need’, and it is arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, as industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day storage at Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production will stop.
Clark said that the Theresa Mays Brexit plan for further connection with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
“We must have an agreement, and we want to get the best deal that, as I say, makes us not only enjoy success at the moment but that we take this opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The company, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful sight of supply chains.”
Toyota could not tell how long the production would be stopped, but warned that increase in long - term costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade unions manager at the factory, said that the members are increasingly concerned: “My experience says that when these jobs disappear, they will never return. ”
A spokesperson from the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be exposed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's destiny meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein may be "exposed for one more week" while the fight around High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of special advisor Robert Mueller, who examines Russian involvement in the elections, relations between Trump staff and Russia and possible obstacles to legal exercise from the president.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Minister of Vice-Jurisdiction or not, and thus threatening Mueller’s independence, has been awarded for months under the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up the conversations with Trump and attempting to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that it was about to leave volunteer.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said that he would “should escape” to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid conflicting with Senate’s Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both the Witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a FBI investigation in one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further subjected a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "The date of the meeting was not set, but it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will argue that Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The program host Chris Wallace asked about the cause.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to opposition to the "self-goodness" of the TV reporters, although she added, "I am not in agreement with their self-goodness."
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
"The President is making more questions than any former presidents," she said and added without proof: "We've looked at the numbers."
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it often, and you've seen that we have often done it in the last few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open arrangements or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he took a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior before a multitude of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS (governmental health) to express their appreciation and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain would leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of application for residence and employment permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Debates between the United Kingdom and the EU on the release have been conducted through the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the harvest.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I would therefore like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each colleague, no matter nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, add valuable experiences and competence that strengthen and improve the work of health services to the benefits of patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we hope that you will stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after head damage
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had an urgent operation after having suffered a head injury during Saturday 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee States' chief trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapseed there," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a bear and took him back for further investigation.
A functionary from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘no information is available on the type/volume of the injury yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transition from Illinois.
He had five roofs on Saturday before he finished his fight, which gives 18 roofs for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying a property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying property in Britain.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young choosers.
Document tax increase will be recovered from those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase up to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying property in Britain — and the extra money will be used to help homeless ones.
The action will be considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young ones, voting to offer more reasonable housing and to framework high income groups.
The documentary tax increase will be imposed on persons and businesses who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the extra money will strengthen the government's actions to remedy the situation of the homeless.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current documentary fee, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to spend up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built property in London is purchased by people who do not live in Britain, driving up prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get the foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “psychological cities ” because of the many foreign buyers who mostly stay outside of the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made suggestions for reducing the documentary fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction firms to keep housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on reasonable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy”.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an outstanding series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give the municipal governments greater power to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year that I would take up my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy housing as it is too hard to work British citizens.
To many people the dream of own home has become too far away, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persists."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager before or later.
The 42 - year - old Scottish enjoys the challenge of reliving the club in the northeast, currently holding third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's what Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“ But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, that option would only come if I succeed in the club leadership."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he wasn't worried about following such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approximations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club, they are undoubtedly belonging to the Premier League,” he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'm probably just going to think of myself as a success here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the management for three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' trainer stack.
Then he helped Alloa to resurrect himself from decline to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of decline to win the master’s title following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the play career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a proper road separation," he remembers when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“ I really thought that management was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income of it, and experienced some fine peaks.
But football play can be hard.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it with regard to stress and pressure at work, but the management feels quite right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, it feels like the most comfortable I've known throughout my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, shows study
The summer’s hot wave has strengthened the income of British hard - pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Puberts and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2.7% in July – while restaurant income fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate consultant of the CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July a similar pattern as last month, June, when the pubs increased 2.8%, except for restaurants being hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the very best result, but an increase that was stronger equal-for-like than that restaurants went down.
Food - served pubs were also difficult with the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for the racing drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% in the month, with food servering decreased 3%.
Paul Newman, analytics from the RSM hotel and restaurant nutrition, said: "These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the most important factors in foreign market turnover.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, and a turnover fall of 4.8% on-year will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-serving companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will give a long-term breathing space."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the braking in rolling out of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry market controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in Britain, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — have secret accounts in social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows research
A study of 20 000 youth school students revealed pages with “fair Insta”.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content is shared.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" as they show their parents.
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — set up accounts on social media that they hid from adults.
A study of 20 000 youth school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts – a reference to image sharing pages at Instagram.
The news has increased the concern that sexual content is shared.
20% of the students said they had an innocent "main account" as they point to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came over the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me. ”
The research carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Private Schools Conference (HMC) revealed that 40% of the 11-18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them agreed to have secret accounts.
Captain Mike Buchanan said: “It is frightening that so many youths are tempted to set up sites where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be 'the voting of the lawyers' in Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to govern Scottish Atletics and has a non-executive role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to see her extensive experiences in internationally nviå over the last ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British, and worldwide free sports environment, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the governance,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, “I am excited to act as a vocal for athletes, and I hope I have much to contribute to guide sports in Scotland. ”
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold, now a strong BBC expert, and after a temporary ice cream attack, she couldn't go.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show whether I want to be restored and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm very good again and have learned to go again, and today I'm doing soft practices!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages."
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares breast - breast - feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump that is carried close to the body,” Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer products, issued a healthy and flourishing, musical video-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cage full of high and cows to a song, including: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail" and "If you don't understand it, this is not jur, it are my tits."
The choir continues: "Push it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my boilers."
However, the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the “graciousnesses ” in the maize.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after their birth," wrote one.
Elvie breast pump is fit in a breast bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Publicly traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hello, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: "For a failed advertising."
Others defend the ad. A woman admitted that the song was "incredible funny".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd like to have one if I still breastfeed.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," it was one who wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny advertising addressed to mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like “cues. ”
This is not a advertising that crystals or judges the maize.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in the bh.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no pipes or snakes and gets fine place in a breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is a so revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provoking launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and milk echoes, we wanted to put a search light on breast pumping and all the challenges, while we show the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump gives in a entertaining and recognizeable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of arrested migrant children has been undergoing even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard retorics and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping forward and making claims to a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a superior official of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed for the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to be a support player for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested persons did not have a former criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we continue to persecute these people," says Albence.
The officers try to handle their children faster and introduce new rules that suggest that some of them meet in court within one month after arrest, and not 60 days that were the previous standard, according to receivers.
Many will be presented through a video conference instead of meeting up personally to carry their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in care, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to receivers and reports that have occurred in the last few months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown by a larger plant such as Tornillo, where children who struggle are easily ignored because of the size of the plant.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can strengthen the traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish ‘occupiement forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the United Nations General Assembly, foreign minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the Minister of Visit, said that the foreign forces remained illegally on Syrian ground under the coverage of combating terrorism and “will be treated afterwards.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without condition," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people are on refuge.
He said that Damascus will continue to “keep this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence”.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the warrior land.
As for refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘ certain Western lands’ of ‘spread irrational refugee’ that makes refugees stay away.
“We have addressed the international society and humanitarian organisations to organise these returns,” he said.
They police what is actually a pure humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
United Nations Diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey establishing a buffer zone in the last major defence position of rebells at Idlib has created an opportunity to press on for political discussions.
The Russian/Turkish agreement defended a large scale attack of Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action will be addressed to jihadists, including warriors of Al-Qaida-related Nusra Front, which “will be destroyed”.
The UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes he will soon be able to invite the first meetings of a new committee consisting of state and oppositional members to develop a post-war basis for Syria and to rail the road for new elections.
Moualem provided conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘examining the articles of the current constitution’ and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won a re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, rich law and scandals would put an end to the presidentship before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidentship ever!”
At the moment there's no sign of searightness.
Since 2014, the viewing figures for best time have doubled more to 1.05 million in CNN and almost tridubbled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best shipping time, up to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has toped the cable seats with a total of 3.5 million viewers in evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, program leader of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognized comedy creator and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to vote on Trump.
She asked why.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to anything else on TV, actions in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Discount is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are far from being an informed person when you sit down for six hours to follow a panel with experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dick in background" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with struts feather worth $15,000 ("a cloth spected with hybris", said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, eh ..., anatomy.
Anyway, I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
“One of the things he makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of “Pawn Stars” about Trump's varied role crew and daily twisting on the plot (flash with NFL, shamrose Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode or you'll be hanging after.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he buried himself in and looked at MSNBC while he picked up CNN.
He couldn't rip off, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the High Court in the United States is at stake.
“I remember when we made all the crazy programs of old and people said this was the end of Western civilization,” said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it proved to be right."

Money from outside flows into the most common choices of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district experiences a flow of money after a relocation of a conventional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting about the same seat.
This newly incredible suburb district in Pittsburg is present with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won its seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb stands against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of ancient Pennsylvania, who overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was retracted after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the elections in the front of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17 district has led to an explosive race of campaign financing between the largest party financing groups, DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button of victory in a closely followed supplementary option for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to the Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the territory with 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats a small leadership.
The United States assessed penalties against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw the management team out to the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the American diplomates from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan”, said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Department, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which estimatedly received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a high - level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year considered as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid - September, officials of the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all the plans for penalties against El Salvador.
Visit president Mike Pence is now targeted to speak to the conference, which is now planned in mid-October, to show the importance of administration adds the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. broadcasters returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomates, who agreed to discuss internal considerations on the basis of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analytist who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the box may be Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstacle to legal exercise, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller also claims to extend the investigation to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in involvement in our elections.
If the convention was to change side, Trump would be put to responsibility in that body, in the middle of the preparations for meeting the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not think to claim that Trump's fall is inevitable – nor for his contradictions in Europe.
We all must be chosen on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a government coup against Hitler, if only the West had risen against him and supported the Czechoslovakes at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history turns around such points, and the unpleasant March of democracy is accelerated or obscured.
The Americans are faced with several of these points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in harsh weather since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret intercepts of the president and wondered that he was unable to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is wrong.
“How will we react if the recently initiated FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations and dishonest witnesses?
And above all, will we vote under the inter-election of a Congress that will put Trump to responsibility?
If we do not comply with these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the experiences I got in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light on the table with the crucifix.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in certainty of the victory of the Austrians after the impressive drawback in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European Liga.
A knee damage prevented the middle tracker Graham Dorrans from making his first performance for the season in the drawback 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks that Rangers can use the result as a jump board to make bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nicked in at the end, but the equal was probably a good result.
I think they were better for the first time, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
On Thursday it'll be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with the home public in the back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The fourth year was absolutely tough, between everything that happened to my damage and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys enjoy; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can stand on now, put the past season behind us and make it up."
Women lose night sleep because of the fear of retirement saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationalwide Study said they talked to the mate about the cost of long-term care.
Just 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“ People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to make that conversation, ” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the advisor and the family where and how care should be given, because such choices may have a great role to play in determining the costs.
Take with your financial counselor: The counselor can also help you to find out how to pay for your expenses.
Financing options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to contribute to covering these expenses or self-surance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Compare your legal documents: Remove legal problems immediately.
Get a health authority placed by appointing a person you have trusted to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some power over your economy.
You choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospitals.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write the details in an overview so that you are prepared.
“ It’s not just the economy that’s at stake — who are the doctors? ” said Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and death numbers are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to receive information from Donggala rulership, a region north of Palu closer to the earthquake with strength 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow Bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Donggala is a rulership that extends over 300 km along the coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, a administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the bearing beams in the central province of Sulawesis, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also met Western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Fire ring in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that met 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with strength 6.8 hit south on Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast, nearly 700 killed.
2009: A earthquake with strength 7.6 encountered near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with strength 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that raged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A green earthquake affected the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while humans were reminded of the devastation of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but over 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested after charges of violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska Guvernor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspicion of domestic violence, causing a report on domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he was supposed to have taken the phone from a woman's acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin's being imprisoned in Mat-Su Warranty Prison and arrested for an unsafe debt letter worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, where he declared “not guilty, absolutely” when he was asked how he addressed the question of guilt, the network reported.
Palin is confronted with three Class A infringements, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and put in a $250,000 cure.
He has also been accused of a infringement of Class B, which can be punished with one day in prison and a $2,000 penalty.
This is not the first time it has been sent to Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the supposed attack.
The case is brought to Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was sentenced for violence at home, crushing with the report on domestic violence, and holding a weapon while he was drunk in the event.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have been killed after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are downstairs, and death numbers are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake was struck near the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It's circulating videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were assembled for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been executed in the State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, supposedly used a car from Home Depot to attack a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he measured down footgängers and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “deliberately” and caused serious body damage intentionally, according to the notice of purpose to seek death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
For weeks after the attack, a federal grandjury 22-pointing valley, including eight sentences for murders in connection with monetary interpretation, in the face of Saipov, normally used by federal prosecutors in matters of organised crime, and a sentence for violence and waste of vehicles.
The attack demanded “a significant planning and enforcement”, said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as “shameful, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco” declares the notice of enforcement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time Southern District of New York led a case that could give death punishment.
Defendants, Khalid Barnes, were convicted for murdering two drug dealers, but were finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after the conspiracy of conspiracy to perform the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy for what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the target.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the accusation on 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were “openly disappointed” over the decision of the prosecution authority.
“We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a confession and lifetime in prison without the possibility of release only will extend the traumas of these events for all involved,” said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death punishment.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a demonstration during the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians should be "feeled" by the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be responsible for the negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrations in Birmingham that Britain would have been deceived now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to forson its deeply divided rows has been emphasized by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State fights to keep his Brexit plan on the track of Brexiteers, Remains and the EU attacks.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to make an agreement with Brussels despite the relapse – and force European shippers and Labour to choose between her package and "kaos".
Bone told the Promotion Demonstrants in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan."
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to become submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone argued that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: “The claim that the British people have changed opinion and want to remain in the European Union is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public; the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and in our activists, which are actually the ones that cross the streets and get us elected first.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Ministers of State keep their job when they hold their promises.”
Farage stated that politicians would have to “feeling the pressure” if they thought to betray the decision taken at the referendum in 2016.
“This is now about trust between us – the people – and those politicians,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are in the wave to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two - hour political collection in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists vifted with Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives of the security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland”, he added.
“It’s a complete phase.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers seriously as a president's candidate.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "estimate seriously as a president candidate" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the democratic of Massachusetts spoke of the future during a Council House meeting west in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elects in November against the Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with electoral men, who have used the city house format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to be a president candidate.
Warren said it's time that "women get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode who killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man that was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at the Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died as a result,” said police manager Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was in the place and had weapons with him, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a commuter and was put in guard at the East Baton Rouge Parish police chamber.
Sims was a two meters high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts the previous season. The average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per battle.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims towards the world master title after stallords give him the victory of Sebastian Vettel.
From that moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' stallords would play a major role in the race.
From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost feathered Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove to the depot first and let Hamilton continue to drive in the back of the main field, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after something pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver opposed to leaving the inside after a double passage to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round on 21th anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race while on his wheels to try to get to a fast end and overcome Kimi Raikon, which was number four.
Finally, he came through the 44th round depot, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds, and the Raikon took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fantastic job to get a good two-span," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her persecution that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused High Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford’s witness before the Senate’s Justice Committee, but he commented that what happened in the Senate shows that people are “wrong, terrible and untrue.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful things that have occurred in the last days of the Senate, when you experience the mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and terrible and speak false,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leaks, they say, “Oh, I haven’t done it.
I have not done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you licked?
Remember her answer... you licked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't licked."
Hey, wait a minute.
We licked... no, we didn't lick," he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the accusations against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein refused that the leak was coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I did not leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidently, and I kept it confidently, as she asked for."
But her denial was not gratifyed by the president, who during the party arrangement on Saturday night commented: “I'll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president indicated that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
"They have decided to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overdrive for power and control," said the president according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-piece lead early through a shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals of Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they hit Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
That was the third meeting for the season between the laws, and Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer’s opening came at 3:35 at Kendall McFaull’s help for four minutes, and David Rutherford opened the game when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt set up to Cownies’ counterfeit at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure Giants had the lead at a break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard compensated once again with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the leadership for the first time during the battle late in second time, and he secured the victory with the team's fiveth halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who has now lost four of the last five fights, plays at home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Aeroplane leader dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia is celebrated as after he died and ensured that a plane that had hundreds of passengers could take away safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy afterquakes continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the strongly swinging control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to make sure Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the wheelway just then, could be safely lighted.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in a hospital.
Talsperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australias ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that death numbers may come into thousands, and the country’s disaster preparation body reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still captured under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,” said the spokesman of the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have raged Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “The whole time ambulances are being seen to get the dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
The minor markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works febrilely to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after the crash in Lagune
The airline who owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific of Micronesia now says that one man is missing, and they reported earlier that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that every Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they didn't have an overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven persons had been transported to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday, and all were stable.
What led to the crash and the precise sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the wheelway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane was missed on the wheelway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wave through mid - depth water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said that the airlines were panicing and screaming and he had a smaller head damage.
U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using a rewindable boat to carry people in land before the plane fell about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Security Network suggests that 111 people have died in crash with PNG registered flights in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities ended the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analytics at the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile copies to pump the movements of 29 - year - old, Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, at the night she died.
Rowlett said he collected localization data from several mobiles that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which struggled with what he had claimed earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same place as Chambers' cell phone in the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the Witness box Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked about Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my trailer was in Nashville.
Another dispute was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile magazines suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telli's call, contact details, messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense will begin by the plan on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York’s childpasser suspects pairs for dismissal after "racist" message
A child - career in New York suspects a couple of discriminatory resignations after receiving a malformed message from her mother who complained that she was “ever a black person. ”
The couple rejects racistism and compares the application target with “expression”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that Giselle Maurice was black when she met up to the first workday in 2016.
"NEEEEEEII ENDA EN SWART PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistake, a “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman quit Maurice, claiming that their dismissed child - career, who was African, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now, Maurice suspends the pair of compensation for the quitting and requires compensation in size order $350 per day for the six-month settlement scheme she was promised, but without contract.
"I wanted to show them that – hello, you just don't do this," she said to New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have turned back against the accusations that they are racist and say the quit of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt they couldn't trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she hadn’t meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
“ But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
Comparison with “expressing” says Plasco was due to the fact that his wife had only two months for the semester and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Is there such a person you want to punish?
It's not very nice," added the share measurer.
While the legal matter goes on, the national court has been quick to condemn the social media couple and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The proposal to Paddington feared that the readers would not accept a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It is very fun to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says that the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the childbook of a little cloth bear, would have been greatly satisfied with the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release was "bitter sweet" after he left last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father in secret was very proud of his success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a prideful person," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does a job: you are proud of it, even though it isn’t really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
At landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looked so bad that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I got the phone from Nad that said she would die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be right back to you.
I'm coming to you.
The physician had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect, and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there waiting, in certainty that it happened.
I couldn't shout and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving over the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she was faced with.
"Nobody knew," she says.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a smooth stream.
It's hard to explain, but that was where on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with careful women to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a mail card on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and telephone numbers of folch can call for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed and killed when he was 18.
“ I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day, ” she says.
The 45 - year - old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a infective smile.
"All knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, “I’m constantly worried that there will be an infectious effect.”
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself - you have to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt depressed or depressed or something,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed the changed attitude.
On Christmas 1st, he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they did not reach eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “There is a big hole in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts research
“I thought that if we could make any of the things he asked for – a time and a range of research – we might get to a certain agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee “did apart” along fixed party limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his republic supporters want the FBI to examine?
The disgrace was due to the timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away, November 6, if the Republicans probably do it bad, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has called around to Senators, driving lobby activities to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so vice-president Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him imposed in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean hops fall under Kim
The number of North Korean sprinklers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator declared.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Department of Collection, said that there had been 1127 disruptions last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most of the North Korean riders are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people flee through China, who has the longest border towards North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China regards the profans as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — which is still technically in war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for discussions about the firm negotiations on denuclearisation.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US penalties for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will be unilaterally rusting down first,” said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's incapable of sitting in the Supreme Court.
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Canditute Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he had a temper that made him unable to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the statements in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only imagine that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical, ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s witness before the Senate’s Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual abuse on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotionate in his opening declaration, sometimes he almost cryed and was crying when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He was also strongly condemned against the Democrats of the Committee and called the claims against him a "great and coordinated character killing" organized by liberals who were angry for the loss of the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he is predicted against democrats.
"I mean he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh before the court if he was approved and if the Democrats received the majority in the house of the representatives.
“I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to the Congress and the FBI, he is not only incapable of sitting in the Supreme Court, but also in the right he is now in,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is at the moment judge of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the inquiry, Kavanaugh avoided questions whether he wanted to examine certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it," said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous anger, months and years of anger, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We weep when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so strange, do you?"
She continues: “I was well helped by a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also weeps when she becomes angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to “you might think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was amazing."
Tears are allowed to expire partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs was in a male - dominated office, crying with unexplained anger, and I was arrested by an elderly woman — a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of — who took me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're sorry and happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic congress woman from Colorado at the time, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to an occupation to the mate on board a boat named Monkey Business, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to investigate the possibilities of standing as a presidential candidate himself.
“ It wasn’t a thoughtful decision, ” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed were one more.
Some called it "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and sweared that she wouldn’t stop if she didn’t get $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"They think I get a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she held her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and to reach choosers instead of delegates, and anger of sexism — that she fell together in cry.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown, ” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
"You should think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking I thought what they would write on my grave stove?
"She crys?"
How the United States-China Trade War can benefit Beijing
The open - up salmons in the trade war between the United States and China were ear - dying, and even though the battle is far from over, a rival between the countries can be favorable for Beijing in the long - term, says experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by putting duty on important Chinese export products, including solar cell panels, steel and aluminium.
The main eskalation occurred this week with new rates of customs on goods worth $200 billion, which means duty of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has repayed every time, now at the latest with five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the United States attacks for attacks, and the second largest economy in the world will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
Getting Washington down means giving up for demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating to the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressures around trade war with the United States can give a long - term positive outlook for China by reducing mutual dependency between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create relationships that start economic ring effects in one of the countries is much more dangerous than the viewers have realized earlier”, said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thoughtsmy.
Syria 'Clare' for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready for voluntary return to refugees and appeals for help to restore the land, which has been raged after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are in progress.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress of combating terrorism,” he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now prepared for voluntary return of refugees to the country because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures affected their daily lives and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
Yet, he stressed that it would not be accepted conditional aid or help from countries who supported the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after hit Team USA with a final result of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn had the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was part of the tournament, wound his tea-snatch in the water at pair-3 16 holes, and had to see himself struck by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari was brilliant on all its rounds and became 1 out of 4 golf players who have ever gone 5-0-0 since the tournament got its current design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 and 4 of the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finals.
With all eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning Europeans through the times of 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t let go.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the stab to his landlord John Ram, who hit the American golf player Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in the growing up,” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four fights in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career points in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest golf players ever, who won 14 major titles, just turned off Jack Nicklaus.
The team of the United States shared the whole weekend in finding fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his troop, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There was moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw up.
The hat off for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We want to regroup, I want to work with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and I want to look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud of being their team captain.
You just need to take off your hat.
We were beaten."
