What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "condition".
The new Councillords of the capital of ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once "blown off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they control the notoric snake that has citizen in recent years where today's coalition partners in Prague have been on the road.
The codified vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Upper Citizen Pavel Bém, has been rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new terms have been shown to be somewhat darkened.
At least they claim that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am rather a new man in Prague politics," reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillord for Culture, to the test of the "Pate-Wordschatze".
But also Councillord Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use sometimes."
"Otherwise I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the newspaper Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election convention, the editorial picked out six terms, especially those notoriously connected to the Prague Magistrate.
The socialists should define the terms "Voldemort", "Greatest Prague Gulf Hole", "Get into the Conditory", "Sterneck", "traitorship of the capital" and "hidden".
Three Prague Councillords agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague school - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even the listener.
The fifth Councillord, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from before.
"These things don't matter to me, and how civil democracies communicate, I do not judge about it."
"For me it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he argued.
As stated above, Lukáš Kaucký claimed not to have recognized in the above-mentioned header that the influenceful entrepreneur and friend of the ex-over-burger champion Bém, Roman Janoušek, is the speaker.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing, and the only term he made correctly at the test was "the biggest Prague Gulf Hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, adding to security, "but I know that rather from the newspaper."
And funny, "I'll have to make a language course."
The "golfhole" will then be discriminated not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillord for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both socialists also know for whom the term Voldemort stands and Lukáš Plachý even knows where this figure can be found and what it means to "go into the conditory".
"I think that is to go to any Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know it is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In accordance with Březina, however, he deems that he has acquired these knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
In fact, there seems to be no similar inhabited snake among the socialists to judge the test participants.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's really no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, we also use shortcuts or nicknames," says the Chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party companions called salop "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues also call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník AktuálnЧ.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
Mr. Weinert is friendly to the party partners of the "Oupa" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made attention to the elections of the party sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igraček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are thus the only one that allows social democracies to speak in the interior language.
Hulinský does not like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Gummip's Rights" is supposed to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to suspend the torture of "Hexes" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped into witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are rather part of the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women "werd" to the witch, she will be strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are sparing this because they help to work and have children," an order sister describes the situation in the capital of the Western African state of Burkina Faso in a special home with more than a hundred women who have been exposed by their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason published a brochure that would interrupt the "hox persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed out the dilemma of written information.
But to be accused of witchcraft is also a gang and present in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they poured them over with petroleum and just burned them.
About this incident, the server also reported BBC.
However, the transgressors claimed that the matter would only have been a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to their version, oil was enflammed, which was used for ritual ointment.
After the group tried to "explode a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "hexes" supports people here without consideration for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Frests of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least seeks to expose the witch hunt, the Gambian President itself has properly mixed with the President itself last year.
"President Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, cultivated a monstrose witch hunt, since these claimed to have a share in their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"To this end he called Shamane from the near Guinea to help them, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, who were violently kidnapped from Gambian villages and brought to the farm of the President in Canilai," the organisation Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the incurred people were forced to drink an absurd from plants with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused tarm and kidney problems.
Two of the armed people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant from Bakala: He heats in the oven - still pays higher rents
An elderly subject is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a catalogue of three new rental contracts for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just paying a penalty.
All three have just increased the rent in the context of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rents, the son will be taken for a 2-room apartment with kitchen for the second category 4100 crowns in the next year.
"And there's no even flowing hot water in the apartment and you need to heat in a simple coal oven," he is angry with his finger tipping on the new hire contract of the son to whose signature he has a full power.
"But what - signed I have," he explained half voted and half resigned.
The Civil Association of BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental conditions "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December to publish an instruction on how to deal with such contracts.
But the man's just waving off.
"One says this, the other says it," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most of the apartments in the Czech Republic whose tenants do not pay market-oriented rents.
Therefore, AktuálnЧ.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region of Ostrava and already nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency are standing with it as a call device.
"Hey 2011", a special key field shines on the touch screen.
Shortly tipped and the device already spits out a number list.
We hardly distinguished the number "157" and already pieping it on the big display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, you're in line.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and similar.
From mid-November in the region of Ostrava, the envelopes with the new rental contracts will flat most of the total of 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG to the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for new rents in the client center has been opened since 18 November.
"The action is running something over a week, that is, that's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply after a moment delay when the "clinist" appears as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a bright topic.
Before the elections, Parliament's Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek, originating in Ostrava, had taken this issue quite loudly from ČSSD, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"They couldn't even change the WC glass," the man mentioned in the opening air.
To date, the employees are mainly advised to the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, which promises RPG to them when they sign the special offer in time.
In the interests of a half-february renter, the other tenants are also supposed to come and sign the new lease contract by 15 December.
Until now, "deegulation switch" in Havířov is all other than overloaded by demands.
"From yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent were here in 2011 because of this," the switch officials appreciated.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both their websites and wallboards where necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, they will be established by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," RPG explains on its websites.
"Nobody's going to court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 pensions, of which 5,000 remains for me for dinner, where I should take the money for a dispute," he says.
Then the employee gets insecure.
"See paint."
"Here Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she recalls.
According to the ruled rent, most of the Czech Republic ends in New Year 2011 and RPG Byty, the increase in rent is an economic need.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the apartment portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the negligence of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is the principal reason for renting.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rents, and it is supposed to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the polster seats in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red lighting information appears in the meantime.
"The leasing increases by 15% in 2011 and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month", is read on the LCD monitor.
Only at 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increases the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases it is about the increase in extremely lower rent prices of 19,66 CZK per square meter", RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments the rent will remain at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not run the rents in the height, but will be gradually carried out within four and eight years.
More - the company is obliged to make a further commitment: all revenues from the rental increase (see chart) will return to the apartments, especially in the heat savings - in new windows and in the heat reduction.
But - priorities are to benefit those who sign the agreements on rent increase.
The architects saw a - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-children garden here, with all that belongs to: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playing area on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The projection and architecture agency Arch.Design, from which athletes come from a wide range of renowned brothers buildings, calculated from the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint with the rooms for its company minisgarten.
In wiser perspective, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby tree age and the company is concerned that the projectors return to their work as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening work, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The construction engineers and architects have so much easier to have their demanding profession and child care.
The Mini-Kindergarten is an original idea of the staff (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they managed to win funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-children's garden is financed by the human resources and employment policy operation programme from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic's state budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of 2.8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be provided and for qualified staff and operations for the duration of 2 years.
After exhaustion of the funds (2 years) the Society Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-children's garden for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, whereas the Society of Economy Rating provided effective assistance in the settlement of the application.
The children are cared for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a child-garden teacher, the childgarden can visit children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And as it is a mini-children garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day is changing over several children.
Children's garden is flexiblely aligned with the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the Mini-Kindergarten is still comparable to the pre-school framework programme.
The children are not just playing here, especially they are offered excellent education - from basic knowledge to preschool, and they are also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
More than that - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive business environment.
The parents can look at the children at any time and thus lose the stress when they get the children lately from a far - distance child garden.
The parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer relationships here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their staff marketing through such programmes.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudi
The roof meets like the backs of a prehistoric escalator, the stairs like the spinal pillar of a dinosaur and the balconies are ripped fish walls.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stones, tile fragments and mosaics, the reminiscent fassades and widespread soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fasade of the house plays with dreamy lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living.
Only when you see more accurately, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night, the whole facade still works plastic, dramatic and special lighting strengthens the shine of colors.
The same vibrant lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Wave-like wood copies the window frames, landings, decorative elements of doors, even glue holes and performances.
The Batlló house in the quarter of Eixample on the busy shopping road Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which was conducted by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the departure of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to Gaudís' idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló house did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner, and also the use of mosaics on the fassade, were created on his board.
However, many more artists and artists also worked with the design of the fassade.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation by Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Park Güell, where there are other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was obtained from the local residents of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "coming house".
It is also said that at the top of the building the sword of the Holy Georg, the cartridge of Catalonia, is represented.
But also other sculpture elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizarre is already at their 45-degree refusal.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the constructive provisions of that time and was not able to fail.
Before the construction, he received the corresponding construction authorisation from the city, but the information made by him on the reconstruction was so vacuum that two years later the fathers of the city were so disturbed by the result that they demanded reconstruction.
Among other things, the Councillords also urged the construction with its pillars to intervene even in the public citizen stairs.
However, changes were no longer made, quite contrary - only fifteen days after the urge of the city district in this respect, Josep Batlló made a request for the authorisation of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was immediately granted to him.
The householder himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a Society Hall, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was deployed to a jewelry business.
The entire six-stage building runs through a staircase up to the roofterrace.
With the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and curved walls.
However, Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be fully linked by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could be comfortable without having to abstain from some intimacy in confidential conversations.
The house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudís rebuilding, except for a new fascade.
The Gaudís game is also impressive with the light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply made himself the principle of use that White reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the World Heritage List of Unesco in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The household owners decided only in the year to this step and this from the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a fairly profitable business, the inspections were kept, and they were also expanded to other common and the roof floors, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the construction time is not a pepper steel, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist cards receive 20 percent reductions.
This amount exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí farmers in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with your dragon towers, try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed roast? Women have other wishes than men
Not the greatst bed frame, but the quality of the floor - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
However, these must be complemented harmoniously in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
In selecting many things play a role - the weight, the size, the condition of health, and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Likewise, the interior in which mattress and rust have to be subjected is important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where no regular heating is made, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to become "heat".
In addition, they are significantly more severe than ordinary polyurethane mattrates.
And - they should be used regularly.
Because if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a fixed plate, moisture is on: so it is not excluded that it forms under its moisture.
Of course, when it comes to the choice, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
Who was a long time abroad, where very high mattresses are common with soft layers, will hardly be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"While all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their disappeared shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these also to sugar-sick people who suffer from a disturbance of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in polster furniture.
That's why I've been providing many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn the benefits of the Visco shame.
This "wonder" really works very easy.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise, it swallows quite on the hot body.
Nowhere presses it, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viskoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (woundsfire).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the footsoles, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, which is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, such as singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
It is comfortable and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bedwidth: "If you are on the back, there should be enough space for the lightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the champion of the polsters and space equipment, who has devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomy of furniture and also promotes this subject to schools.
In a double bed, everyone needs his own rust and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing remains other than to mount the rust at different heights and this is not possible at all for each bed frame.
Shoematrats should be at least 14 cm high, matrats with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should fall on the shape layer and the fine polster.
"The feathers must not be felt with the hand or when they sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Completely polished beds with mattress and sheets like collapsed siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't be lifted and the reference cannot be washed, what is already going on today.
And as you lose in one night between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress becomes a huge (and stopped sheep).
This is why experts reject advertising logics that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong warranty for mattresses.
Every thing has her If and But.
And therefore, a practical advice from the merchants: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, do not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, distractable supplies, but it is recommended to use a mattress scouter that can be easily distracted and washed.
Even though the mattresses are usually made with round-ripped locks today so that one gets two halfs after opening (most important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often as the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of here!
Or maximum for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Likewise, they should better provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no) and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with soft pocket core and fine polsters.
Polyurethane mattrates do not belong to such a documentation.
For non-adjustable lattic roses with 14 to 18 feather bars (Lame) Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (perhaps also combinations of latex and cocos), always paying roasts with a larger number of lattes, i.e. from 28 and more feather bars, with Lordosen support in the bowl area and the possibility to regulate the latte hardens.
On adjustable lamellenrostes, no mattresses with spring skelet are included, as they do not respond to the ergonomic shift.
In addition to setting the sticks of the feathers, special flexible shoulder modules are offered.
This is about a special mounting of the feather bars, which enables you to press the feather bars or even distribute them to allow the punctual insink of the shoulder of the sleeper.
An important thing for men with wide shoulders.
There are even mattry manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "Herrenmatrats".
The ladies are also thought of - these soft zones are enjoyed in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-lasting feathering systems (Lattoflex) or roasts with point-lastic contact paths are designed with so-called multitorsion feathering.
The pressure is distributed on several points, reducing the tension.
But - if you use a bad (to large and filled) head kiss for the right mattress and real rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here also a rule: the head kiss should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders to relax the shoulder muscles.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large cushion appears, as it likes the Scandinavian.
In the side position, the head kiss (in combination with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Something has our modern mattresses have common with the single (filled with hill) stroh bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their subsections.
The new word "Bio" is also called "Bio" in matratzen.
Rather than petroleum raw materials are used for the production of polyurethane shoes increasingly natural oils - for example ricine oil and soya oil.
Soya is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called for matratzen, which consists of materials of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also get micro-capsules that spread fresh forest or lavenger dust while sleeping.
Also here you make a difference between husband and woman.
While a "cooling" plant extract from bearing leaves is used in the men, so that the mattress relationship can absorb the heat and cool the body, the amounts for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts from red paprika shots rain the blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Matratzes from cold foam (he has larger pores with degraded cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different starches (hearts) of coldshoes and visco shoes creates more zone mattrates, which know exactly where head, hip and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are regarded as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex benefited from this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers of manufacturers and merchants that offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress duofreeze with the vico-saum memory related to 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that started the era of viskoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at nearly cosmic rate.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because astronauts are exposed to huge overloads at the start.
Temperature becomes soft at heat, in cool environment it becomes strong again.
Thus it perfectly adapts to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimum way.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but it generally increases sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses but also in other health products, such as in special foot polsters to facilitate the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children grows and thus considers more and more parents to monitor them via GPS.
The system that was originally invented for the flag of cars can be as good for people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently in the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette bag, but soon it should not be larger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have placed the case of disappeared Anička in fear and horror, so they keep looking for means and ways to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an insufficiency of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not about spioning around at all, but to reduce an effective means of reducing the probability of the tragedy," says Petr Pilin from Macro because, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there can be an abuse of such devices in the individual case, for example, if you put it in your pocket, without knowing it, but we hadn't noticed any such case until now."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
However, he believes that the child should always know the purpose of the "sack" and how to use it in an emergency.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child is not able to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they do not want to be controlled."
"But the mobile phones at first raised great expectations with the parents, but they can be as easily switched off as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočková.
They also believe that it is controversial whether such an institution really helps in the event of an attack.
"By planned kidnapping, the kidnapper practically always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be placed."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices are more widely used, they would also seek them, as their sales would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be very helpful when suddenly attacked by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech by the company RC Monitoring, offering location services both for cars and for persons, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the position in certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"By more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and stay in motion, the device immediately sends a warning under the name of the position," says Mr. Čech.
He believes that similar services could also perform smart mobile phones with navigation, but only a special software is needed to be recorded.
The problem of the current location devices is that it concerns either devices in straw bag size, the trailers are similar to or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing it.
Mr Pilin from the Macro because, according to this, it is being tested in the presence of devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that the eventual attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what the police are going to have a time in advance," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development goes - to armbands or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of location function using the GPS system (like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many teeth snows that you could turn around all the Czech Republic but just keep two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of the circuit, which is detonated with explosions.
In the previous year, the Defense Ministry had already delivered 224 kilometers of fire to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the army has provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the teeth snow - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the circuits from the STV Group, a.e. for lips of 40 million crowns.
In its reason for purchasing this huge quantity of fires, the MF DNES General Stack replied that the soldiers would use the 60 km of the circulation each year.
According to the research by army pyrotechnics that MF DNES addressed, this statement shows that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and pump wives.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only so the significant annual consumption of 60 kilometres of fire snows was halfly justified.
This length corresponds to 25.000 detonations.
However, these army stocks would also be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies to the training of every new professional soldier, two metres of the lighter, the army has created a calm stock for the 225 years mentioned, even in the face of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the Quick Insurance Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no longer cartridges for handfire weapons, so that shooting of the lack of funds is severely restricted because of their lack.
Quiet from the deficiency of the underwear.
"I don't agree to why they buy such quantity of fire from us."
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Defense Ministry, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of density in that the army would have been covered with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, speaks of a four-year use period of the inflammatory and police and army pyrotechnics of only two years.
"By perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the expiry of the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
These tests, however, are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometres of fire.
"They cost us 60 per cent less than the last 244 kilometer delivery," speaker Pejšek informs us of the position of the buyers of the Defense Ministry.
Compared only: The annual consumption of pyrotechnics of the police, ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army has exceeded almost 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only such amounts of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the use period.
Already because of the safety of the pyrotechnics, the possibility of flexible purchases of moderner and thus also reliable teeth snows are also open.
The Defense Ministry still has huge problems in liquidation ten thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warschauer contract when the two hundred thousand heads of Czechoslovakian people's army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyro technicians who addressed MF DNES, the Czech army expects in a few years the same problem with liquidation hundreds of kilometres of old teeth, which it has purchased so "favourable" today.
Until today, I find the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "Small Businessers of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Small Businesser of the Year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success is a movie scene.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Only abroad, he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of good overnight possibilities at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and by means of a bank credit, he created a buildingable house with five apartments.
If one remembers that he was a high school student in the sixth semester, this was surely a courageous business.
"The then price-quality ratio was annoying me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit in the house, which he then rebuilt step-by-step to pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of more than 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec in just seven years of business.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we have sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders in the Franchise of the Pytloun Hotels have already reported," says the entrepreneur number One of last year.
"A large share of this license sale for the business of hotels had just the victory in the competition "Entrepreneurs of the year", Mr Pytloun admits.
The victory has brought him more familiarity, even popularity in Liberec and the environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say that was really good," he remembers.
I really recommend participating in this competition to all who want to create something.
You don't have to win as soon as you can, any visible making is good.
He says that he benefits from contacts and acquaintances to which otherwise it would not have come at all.
"With some people I have encountered thanks to the competition, I am presenting regular business relations until today."
The fame associated with the success, he also believes, is a little affected by each of his employees.
And that's where he's at the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be granted to general recognition."
I do not really see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little fronted," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my followers a quieter year than we had it in Farmet
The victory seuphoria was quickly resolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, farmet has the worst behind itself.
The price for the first rank of the Vodafone company in the last year received Karel Ž州árský, the company owner of farmet.
The jury at that time deserved the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Scalece a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that this assessment encourages not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight with competition," says the winner of the previous year.
At the beginning of farmet's business history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel ◆āárský as compensation for the property entrusted by the Communists, he did not hesitate, he had his career in the company where he was busy until then, suspended and founded his father's own company with a few companions.
Shortly later, they began to focus on plant oil prints.
Within 18 years, they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only by success in the above-mentioned competition and its medialation it has also become aware of non-faculty publicity.
"Not just that our customers are now more intensely observing the brand Farmet, our foreign partners also began to be able to cooperate with a company that has achieved the highest possible success in their country," says Karel Ž Žárský.
Last year, however, farmet was not just a sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time was even less shaking the citizens, but in particular businesses, just reached their climax - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't miss this situation."
"The turnovers decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even take loose action," explains Karel Ž
Sometimes a viable company must take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to control the situation and to keep the company in the black numbers, even if with less profits, than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to abandon - investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we reinforced our presentation on international fairs and acquired main prices in domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers grow again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new victory a lot of pleasure in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel Ž
A question of opinion that cleanses up with insane rules
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time.
Some foolish regulations have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year's opinion survey "absurdity of the year", the obligation to create documents available online to authorities was advanced.
Thus, more than a third of not entirely four thousand entrepreneurs decided.
In this way, the social insurance administration demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have collected it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extraction from the commercial register in the future when checking social insurance payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Bura
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "absurdity of the year" is to take into account all the rules and arrangements, fulfil the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the stupid ones.
This is already the fourth time of this year part of an entrepreneur's competition, which is organised by the economic newspaper (HN) and is enjoyable in the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were four thousand in this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activities.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we are taking a front rank in the world," says Karel Havliček from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship in recent years is the proclaimed objective of all governments.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank data, Czech Republic takes the 74rd rank as regards corporate conditions, compared to the previous year, an eight - worse spot.
The competition absurdity of the year was first proclaimed in the year and takes place every year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition.
For registration, the web address is www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the Competition Organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allows the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.hnned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets most of the voices.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and arrangements have been reported on this year's opinion survey.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, there are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and fast roads have to pay to Maut or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must provide every two years.
This year's "Seven" list is published on the sides of competition.
The calling of competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of a event, which also regularly involves personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized companies and traders of the Republic, and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, were at the peak of competition with the party.
"Where the State throws the entrepreneurs in the middle of the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my goal to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year which unnecessarily difficult the entrepreneurs today," Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade, informed.
The efforts to create insane orders from the world prove effective.
In 2007, the people mostly disturbed the entrepreneurs' obligation to report three days in advance to the business office at the site of their permanent establishment to have an exhibition or Kirmes with an exhibition.
This obligation was repealed by a novelle of the commercial law.
The duty to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the Employee's Employee Office to a extent of up to 30 days - has been abolished by the Law on Green Card.
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation on physics therapists was elected to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two guards in the speaking room.
This Regulation was painted somewhat by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator obligation fell away.
A new category deserves socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education and sport projects
A new one in this year's fifth year of the competition of the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "Sertified Company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We want to support those companies who are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurship on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the VDAfon mobile company, is the proclaimer and warrant of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of Vodafon's main competition company, companies notified for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and fine enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrally in the subject of their activity, their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
For example, among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, which then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main sponsor of a Foundation for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also cares for their healthy disabled employees, which represents 70 percent of their employment, and which she was rated as the title "Service of Responsibilities of the Region of Middle Bohemies", and in the competition Vodafone Company of the year, she was in the context of this region in the third rank.
In the Olomouc region, MiRyz Soft, the accounting company, which introduced a flowing and also averaged to 35 hours a week and this without a proportional wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is purchasing mainly with Czech manufacturers, supporting citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and working in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurship and administration for the environment," explains her manager Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is also located in the health of his employees and has therefore acquired ergonomic seats and keyboards to all notebooks, as well as supporting homework and corporate actions, it uses carting services offered by a locally protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation of "Mens in Distress" which provides concrete assistance from the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
The activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region is also worth mentioning which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra-busses.
"We provide our employee contributions to eat, to work, to increase their qualifications and to vacation," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Marerish-Slesian region.
As regards the category responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the Vodafon Company were automatically registered for the year's competition, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "the responsible company of the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified for that reason."
"A separate application only for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," Karel Goldman explains by the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Soil Funds - Police arrests at public procurement
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anticorruption police took arrests in the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was derived from the detectives in handcuffs.
He claimed to have tried to manipulate a precise public competition to settle refund claims in such a way that the sites offered in competition were subject to a specific stakeholder.
It is supposed to have paid Luboš G. a half million for it.
"On that time I can only confirm that the police are persecuting a person in public competition because of the delict of fraud," said Antonie Zelená, Head of Pilsner State Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo", she could not provide further details about the current investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
In the way he was able to manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate about this in view of the bad official information.
The speaker of the Lubomír Černá ground fund pointed out the question of Právo in this respect that the police actually arrested the Pilsner side of the ground fund and that during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she concreted.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the proper term "Requirement for the supply of claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the property offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their refund claims to be compensated by the transfer than the value of the property to be proclaimed."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was evidently available information, who had logged in on the request and since he was a justified person, since he had purchased a number of refund claims, he offered a property interests that he would withdraw from the competition.
Apparently against a fat detection.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner's ground fund in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Soil Fund, which was criminally persecuted because he issued plots in replacement refunds which had already been held by location decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, also acquired lands intended for the construction of public streets, precisely where the construction of the accession magistral was planned for the commercial area of Borské pole.
Later he exchanged this very favourable with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic centre of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
At that time, the house of the Council had to give hard hearts little in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the lands.
The housing costs of households rise by a few hundreds of each month
The households must not only expect higher costs for all kinds of energy from January to January, but also higher water and waste water charges, and for heating and somewhere, rents also grow.
From January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more from the wallet monthly than before.
Power becomes up to 4.6 per cent more expensive, gas by 2 per cent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to tenth more for water supply and somewhere you will also devour the remote heat supply.
The households alone cost a few hundred more crowns each year.
The strong electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, thus debt is the significant promotion of electricity production from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic plants.
Although gas only becomes moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to warm the most and have the highest consumption.
So also here is a number of hundred crowns to be expected more per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heating are different from city to city.
Primarily larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more than 50 crowns a month from January to January, more than 1000 crowns more per year paying families in Liberec.
On the other hand, Prague's inhabitants are threatening 9% higher water and waste water charges and this in the event that the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague continues to be one of the lowest compared to the entire Czech Republic.
In the northern coast, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water fees are to rise by 7.4 per cent.
For example, huge rental prices are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where from January the so-called rent regulation is dropped.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100 percent from January.
Those who do not agree with this leasing increase want the company to have judicial interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, will rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drinking themselves with remote and room beer is out - it simply works too slow
Fernet, Room and Wodka, exceptionally a good whisky that was stolen from the father's house bar.
These are the drinks whose drinks need to be treated most often by the Czech adolescents under fifteen.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep their cats in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evident from the experience of physicians faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics.
"Bear or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, head of the Children's Department in the Mediterranean Hořovice Clinic.
"Whisky, if the father manages to escape a bottle from the house bar, and if not, at least remote or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing him with juice, then he doesn't smell so strongly," explains the chief doctor.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most often it's about remote or space."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"Slimowitz, which is taken from home, was also the case," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in the hospital are no exceptional.
Before the Hořovice Hořovice Clinic, at which he has been working since this year, he has been working in the Motol Hospital School for 10 years, where the rescue cars delivered drunk students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at 12 years when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and still in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was in the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother did not seem strange that her daughter did not come home 48 hours," the chief doctor wonders.
Just the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when kicking with their own sprays is considered to be one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
A real dependency in the true sense of the word, according to experts, is not the case with children.
"Under alcoholism, a long-term chronic dependency on alcohol and all the related phenomena are to be understood, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chief Professor Pelikán.
According to Mrs. Jurinová, the speaker of the Motol Hospital, about 40 drunk children were instructed in the local Department of Children and Youth Medicine until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcoholic poisoning that required hospital stay are recorded in statistics.
Drunken children who are brought home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police after an ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only a bottle of snacks in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three year-old amplitudes on which hundred percent of them are trusted: Walpurgisnight, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter was for two reasons - either for the pain of the bad testimony or for the joy of holidays."
"In the Walpurgisnight I have already experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," stresses Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who has to fight only with a unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning that occur from dehydration and glucose deficiency can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid-sensitive infusion with glucose and nutrients lacking the organism.
"They are obviously better on it, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with good silence without hurting anywhere."
"You're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, sometimes degrading the patient's good lamentation by counting them the costs she will cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in a acute bed will be good and pleased on a few thousand crowns.
"Once and again, I used this as a means of training when I directly expected the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost, and that it can certainly happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single fat," adds Dr. Pelikán.
However, he believes that the healthcare providers do not follow regression procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of drunk children by parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two lightweight fighting aircraft L-159 of five, which exchanged the Czech Defence Ministry against the Casa C-295M transport plane, fled to the Spanish city of Sevilla on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS seats.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have been seen in abroad only at manovers or flight shows.
This is the two-seat flight version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three planes are one-site L-159.
These are currently kept in the Aero Vodochody, the mediator of this business - the Omnipol company - has taken over it last week.
When the aircraft are physically expeded from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Defense Ministry, is not yet known.
The one-site fighting aircraft L-159 was, in turn, separated from long-term aircraft, and this without any further deposits and investments on the part of the Ministry.
"The two-seated L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army will not have to come out without two-seated fighting aircraft, since the Defense Ministry signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody on the reconstruction of four overflowing L-159 into a two-seat version in May 2009.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has undertaken to carry out the fighting aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the company is the EADS operator of aircraft L-159 and that they are intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the dealer's way he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport plane Casa and the purchase of other planes for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by Mirek Topolánek government last year.
The Defense Ministry had not announced any tendering procedure at that time, but addressed the EADS directly.
The Defense Authority of the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, from which it used only 24, the rest wanted to sell them.
The purchase of the Casa planes may also have a legal replay.
The European Commission declared the Czech Defence Ministry at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three planes of Casa, the last is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer point finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of sicking cancer
Men whose point finger is longer than the ring finger are evidently less likely to suffer from prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is intended to be associated with the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this in particular for men up to 60," explained the co-autor of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should be subject to prostate cancer testing, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study, the right finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer as for 19 percent of men whose ring and point fingers were equally long.
However, in men whose point fingers were longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 per cent, with men up to 60 per cent even 87 per cent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already prenatal, apparently reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer point finger.
Previous research revealed that the testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was fugitively known to him, yet he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer risk has been "to be fully proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the largest part of Europe, Czech Republic is also under a snowdock on Thursday morning.
On the streets and roads is mostly stuck snow, the winter servants were in many places the whole night on the axis.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked for cars and cars and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague "stands".
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
A truck crashed at mile 91, two trucks crashed at kilometer 93, and there were injured ones in this accident.
A few trucks are also located in the street grave.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also crashed here.
The drivers should drive off or drive over Brno at kilometers 190, and at kilometers 182 at the location of Kývalka.
Because there is a mileage of steadyness.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened and this is the same as when we were going to Prague.
In Prague itself is a multi-centimeter thick snowdock and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form in Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transport is in any case the metro.
The roadways travel with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and peaceplace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis stack will meet.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech state railway had to cancel seven speed connections due to snowways.
For example, there are problems on the road Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - repentance.
Travelers should have to inform themselves of the current situation.
The airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. at night to 5 a.m. in the morning.
Most of the roads in southern marrows are only travelable with increased caution.
In the area of Vyškov, three sideways are totally unfit, in the vicinity of Brno, snow waves and in the vicinity of Blansko are forced to use snow fries on some higherly located streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three streets are still completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Also here you will have to use snow cleaning snow fries.
When they get ridable again, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the field of white carpates.
On the streets, which are only allowed to be distributed with inerted spraying agents for natural protection reasons, is up to five centimeters of thick snow cover, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten inches of new snow, mostly in northern Bohemia, fell to 18 inches.
In the Marerish-Slesian region up to 15 cm of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops have for the first time used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan, which is known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and move the force relationship to their benefits.
The new gun is something like a super-precise canon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a meeting security of just a few meters.
The special caliber 25 mm shots that have been developed for this gun and contain high explosive explosives work practically like small granates.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode not only at the point of the target, but at any point of their ballistic railway.
This means that you can use it against an enemy that hides behind a barrier - a wall or in a shooter grave.
Because from above, it is usually not protected, so the murdering steel splitting rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new fight gun is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is basically doing this: he shows the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, he wins a precise point of view after which he corrects the increase angle, then he only needs to print off.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 metres."
"When you press, the gun is picking up and shooting the shot at distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are shifted
The company Fujitsu transfers its establishment to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
In July next year 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu transfers its establishment to Frankfurt in Bad Homburg.
As the industry specialized in computers and maintenance reported on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be moved from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park in July next year, this is a large office complex on the Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurter Stadtteil Niederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained that there should be another 100 jobs from the group in the medium term that have been distributed to the region.
The hire offer was very attractive, and the large room offices in the Astro Park would be better able to counteract the work of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been a renter.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment of the losers yesterday.
Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdesigner Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" was won again.
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Oberbürgermeister Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management board about the intent.
"Of course we offered our assistance to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendship contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long space in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu on the cottage and the surrounding "Small Vertical" was one of the most controversial buildings of the Kurstadt ten years ago with the rest of the buildings on the Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between train station and Councilhaus a new city centre was created, both due to the massive construction of the areas used previously as a parking lot and the height of the buildings provided criticism.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, launched Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by the Frankfurt Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group in 2006 together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Fujitsu conuzes in Tokyo call themselves the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhein-Main-Gebie is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions enters Frankfurt-Niederrad, which is intended to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped basic rise - the Central Companion of Electrical Technology and Electronics industry has its seat.
Amazon locks Server - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks are increasingly in distress.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform in the United States is increasingly tailored.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
However, the prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol flag lists, is supposed to stay after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks expelled from Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the Freien", the disclosure activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time) by short news service.
Recently, the Internet Company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had rejected the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depths in order to manage the high access numbers to the documents.
With Twitter, Wikileaks further explained: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with speech freedom, "will they stop selling books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his servers by Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's staff have conducted research, the television broadcaster CNN reported at Lieberman's office.
The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have wished Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of the previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to reject the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unbelievable and reluctant approach risks our national security and threatens life around the globe," says a communication from the pardelose senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is searched for rape suspected by the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of flags of Interpol.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Great Britain is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet Activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intricate of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There was even a call after a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange rightly fears his security, said Mrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Mrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former republic governor of Arkansas, Mike Hokkabee, had requested that the responsible for Wikileaks disclosures be accused and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant of Head of Government of Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was a breakdown.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "absurd and absurd" that Assange had demanded the retirement of foreign minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known spying demands on diplomas.
"I'm not sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. Government now fully puts the protection of its databases on the testing level.
The Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Action, Russell Travers, was appointed as Special Agent, informed the White House.
Travers are responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had been necessary after the publication of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways the whole government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. Government also announced that they would want to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active, they should be endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've done everything to get in touch with them," said outside official speaker Philip Crowley.
"We're ready to protect them if this should be necessary."
Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice scandators are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where's the whole ice?
From Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiner, in German a little older than the ice scotor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
With a spoon, the gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerator, strikes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in Bologna Province.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he does not come by the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice university established the manufacturer of ice machinery in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can be complied with the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses around the chocolate ice and practice in the house's own ice parts.
Some dream in the Midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare to the smooth ice of their vain desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the industrial cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate advisor and wants to do something in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice part in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatines Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also the silent flavour and the good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the snails of the national and at least southern overbuilding: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romantics in it."
The first step towards production seems quite simple.
Luciano climbs the basic ingredients of milk, snake, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns up a hahn on the machine, and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice varieties.
Instantly, the doctor is entrusted with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you leave your own desire for experiments free?
Luciano warns against being led into the wrong spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only of natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarque flour from the guarbone.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilizer, but it only needs to be sold within one day, otherwise it swallows into yourself, and the customer bites on pure ice cereals.
Some variations on the basic mass are allowed.
It'll be more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn to you dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
either in the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white ground mass, which becomes with eggs yellow cream and with cacaopulver as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to get to the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, chocolate, occa and haslenus - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanillaaroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment will also be subjected to the species of fruit.
More flavours, more fruit pure - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Haselnus-eis does not necessarily taste more nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stable.
Only a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice manufacturing is an calculating task: If pearse pure is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra proportion of sugar is required for lemoneneis.
Luciano draws up an apparatus to determine the sugar content of the fruit species (winzer measures the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the computeriness.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for automatic manufacturing of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamly at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation to despite, small pans do not endure.
The Brazilian Gustavo climbs himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit peasants when the overdimensional stable mixer disregards him.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a matter of time until something like that happens."
Controllers in the wheel
The European Food Authority Efsa is submigrated by the industry experimenting with genetical plants.
This claim now forms the expert group Testbiotech, who understands itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech-Chef Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years also in the lobbyist association Ilsi.
It is paid by groups like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa test rules for genetical plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The Efsa regulations are dependent on Ilsi's position documents and thus deceive the manuscript of the industry, which is to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian parma.
It's already the second time that testbiotech combats an interest collision.
Thus, a high-level Efsa manager was recently without obligations or transitional period to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta - and thus changed the sides.
The Central German Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personal links between EU controllers and industrial lobby, which made the Environmental Association as well as the EU Parliamentarians lighthearted.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, are recovered as long as they are of high professional quality, is said in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa do not require them to have any contacts with industry.
But you have to reveal these.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This itself refers to a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobby contract.
In this case independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding test in animals and the response of genetical plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what makes genetically modified corn on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the entire genetical plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" ask then accusing.
Angelika Hilbeck also sees this.
The scientist has been researching gentechnology since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zürich.
Industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe in this field as in the United States.
There is therefore little more researchers who have not been involved with groups.
Critical studies for companies would normally not be published.
"Industry controls safety research," Hilbeck claims.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in the form of Stuttgart railway station, the Tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's sneaking.
The story is known: In September the baggers had been pushed and had started to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions of depths of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grey stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't disappear."
He swears: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he said to one, he smelled like a cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the chunks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of Stuttgart Steine leads into a forest at Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone range.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked at the Abriss in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would male to scots or disappear in the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden bay that once was a watchhouse.
He was blasphemed and threatened when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the remains of the northern wing from the interruptor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the arise.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were to be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos of heavy quadrants, a piece price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some, but also in the hope of returning him in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large truck charges.
About half is still camping in the woods, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardens, housebuilders.
From everywhere they had come and dragged away what baggage and trailers could wear.
The Stuttgart stones of the hit have long been transformed into "maurle" or to restrictions of herbbeds.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"I wouldn't be the political component."
He rises into his campsite car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
Jura he studied and cancelled, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stones are stored.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he is the largest Altstein dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow, there are artificially shrouded sandstones.
"They once belonged to Dresser Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's hot.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
He points to a bunch: red sandstein, former part of Karlsruher railway station.
And continue.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once the quader belonged to the tribulation of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Sankt Blasien Dom, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were used to crawl by hand and moved with simple bottles and oxen cars, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you were to scratch something like that."
He hasn't become rich. He hasn't been rich in stone.
But 14 people are busy today, and above in the forest stone metz, a sculptor, a smith, a glass bladder, and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the remainder.
Next time he'll have to go to Cologne.
Also there are stones to save.
Talent struggle for High-Potentials
There's a governmental Andrang in the buffet.
16 students are pressing for salmon bread, tomatoe soup and sweetness.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car builder Volkswagens have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to get to know with VW developers about the car of the future - alongside people's cars.
In the contest about the smartest heads, many companies are now going into the neighbourhood and, like VW, put on collaboration with the universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented graduates in the hearing halls as early as possible before they come to the labour market and be reclaimed by others.
And because universities do not give out statements about the performance of their students, the exceptional talents are attempted to explore and bind to themselves in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car corporation wins around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of practitioners and student jobs and shows them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come in contact with industry and collect experiences."
"VW can at the same time meet students, look closer at interesting candidates and consider who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperation, such as Cell, is not unusual.
New be that the students are so offensive.
"Sunst was the focus on the professional project," says Cell.
The struggle for the fresh graduates will probably become even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
In particular, they have to commend themselves and in particular to bolt for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to Deutscher Ingenieur VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For the economic audit and advisory company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent hunt.
It organises vital recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever may join, decides in two selection rounds in front.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many candidates flys to the United States.
As the high-potentials at the universities are shaking and stitching, the protector becomes increasing according to the depth.
"We want to get out of the masses with the race."
"Only a simple sailing eagle was too little for us."
For talent hunters dykta seems to have the bill.
"We have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are just ahead of their graduation and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct bulk at the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also very classic in professional measuring.
"We're trying to reach graduates at special measurements."
"On the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the growing problem.
Currently, 35 jobs are awarded on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy beautiful positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the uni professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do practice with us or write your diploma work."
Expensive advertising operations are not required by solar specialists.
The company is trying to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"This can't be offered by a large group," says staff manager Stube.
Money is no longer the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, child care or good rising possibilities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld investigated the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual top list of German employers.
In this context, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and are looking at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stube also expects the placement of plus points among the job seekers.
"I think that candidates are looking especially for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employers with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer leads over your own employees," he says.
In the branchenjargon, the internal Employer Branding, i.e. employer trade marking training within its own staff.
"A satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would advertise themselves with friends and acquaintances alone for their employers.
"This is like a game with bands," says Warler.
Obama stops new oil drills
Beside the coast of the United States of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drills in the coming years.
An appropriate ban has been adopted by the government in Washington - and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
Also outside the Atlantic coast, new drills remain banned first.
This informed Ken Salazar, Minister of Interior, on Wednesday.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drill platform in April is a strict ban that is intended to apply at least for the next five years.
Before the accident, which cost eleven workers life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled on the pressure of opposition and industry to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
In this way, the supporters want to reduce the US's dependency on alives from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil pest in the Gulf have not been finally clarified until today.
The centre of criticism is the British Energy Group, which faces billions of demands.
An inquiry commission on Obamas' order is to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Inner Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop hanged after the explosion.
Afterwards, various oil companies had applied for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At the moment, the competent control authority, which has been brought into question after many complaints of corruption, is fundamentally reformed.
Parallel to this, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax gaps for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now warns publicly that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulations than before.
"The government's plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the BDO advisory company - even before the bore ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also regrets the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows exactly what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further – the burden of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank site: billions of litres of raw oil has destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live of theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari does.
"Don't worry," the ecoactist calms the journalists: "You'll get enough oil sludge before the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illustrate a boy waving up to the breast in the water with the sleeves surrounding him: In the rainbow colored water glow the scene is almost beautiful.
The fact that brown oil sweating under the surface is not seen.
In the past, she gathered garnals here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River.
In the meantime, the flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a bored pipeline poured out mass of raw oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to run six hours to get into fishing waters: the Ogoni land located in the heart of the Nigerdeltas is considered to be one of the world's most devastated regions.
During the journey through the mangrove moulds covered by rivers, the entire extent of destruction becomes visible.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat cools brown bridges, who draws his hand into the water draws out evil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rise like black lacrites from the ground, let sadly palm trees hang their weeds.
Birdswerms, as they are normally used in moisture areas, are chosen in vain: as soon as the outer borders are silent, there is a splendid rest in the former paradise that smells like a tank station.
"What happens here is environmental warfare," says Celestine Akpobari dark: "We live in a constant risk to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
Andoni's settlement area is a battlefield that has been fought for decades: the first explorers from Europe embraced over 60 years ago, here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is refused to return to Ogoniland: while from the entire Delta region of the threefold size of Switzerland with over 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres pipelines daily more than two million fisses of black gold are pumped, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too instable to the group.
All hundreds of meters are raging stealing positions like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the drill holes too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Repeatedly breaking such a drill head, Akpobari means, then a constant stream of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been flooded into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year by year the amount of oil, as they were pressing to the sea at the supertanker's "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Those who are responsible for the persistent eco-GAU will be argued.
During the shell group Sabotage and organized oil steel are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see stable drill heads and leak pipelines as the main cause of pollution.
In Nigeria, Shell lays down significantly lower safety standards than usual in the world, American scientist Richard Steiner presented to the group in 2008: only the rate of defects on the lines is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smitted workshop under the free sky appears from the mangrove shapes: they are divided and swallowed up to the throat.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly willingly dispersed on the ground, a fire flashes: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the capture trap, later drops at the end of the cerazine and eventually diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel deficiency in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with nearly 40 euro cents per litre can still undermine the illegal cookers: for they get their raw materials for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkerers" who squeeze the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts throughout Nigerdelta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of raw oil daily.
However, only a disappearing small part of the temporaryly intercrewd raw material is illegally eroded: the number of lions fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankships and screws it in the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is more guilty of the revolving of the population or of the lax production method, the activist considers Akpobari purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as intruders and they would not have destroyed the fishermen's life basis so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft nor illegal refineries."
In the meantime, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell was so devastated that only a deduction of the group could be questioned: "Most other nationalities like the Chinese appear as better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Maximum time you disappear," says the musculoskeletal oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil retailers are captured by the special unit of armies, they are not threatened by arrest, but probably a painful measuring money.
Also, the soldiers mainly from the Northern Order want to benefit from the raw material, as all Nigerians do.
"This damn thing has brought our country on the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Detecting dangerous construction errors in A380 engineering plants
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a "disastrous driving failure".
The Qantas flight line is now trying to accuse the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not-landed Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have known much more happiness than so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major security problem in the operations of some A380 machines - and now warns about a possible construction error.
The potential deficiency would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil snake connection, he could produce tired circuits and leaks, said in a opinion of the ADSB authority published on this Thursday.
This could have resulted in "a disastrous driving failure".
The vehicles produced by Rolls-Royce are affected in 20 A380 planes.
Below is the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British Turbine manufacturer.
She submitted a complaint at an Australian Bundesgericht in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said his airline would demand damage for the incident at the beginning of November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire the cause of the damage.
Now, after the incident, up to 40 operations have to be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian detectives announced further safety tests to the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the driving plants concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said the ADSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380, the Lufthansa exchanged the drive as a precautionary measure.
The two-piece flight is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Country-wide snowfall triggers transport chaos
Germany in White: Overnight almost all over the country Snow has fallen.
Chaos, trains and flights fall out on many streets.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter frosts Germany: at ice temperatures almost the whole Republic is cut on Thursday the night - which leads to transport chaos in many places.
In the north and the east, some 15 cm of thick snow covers are located.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is strongly restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, winter service was in durable operation, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
Heavy bows over the Baltic Sea coast were also blurred.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) expects from the morning on the East Sea Coast of Schleswig-Holstein on storms with water stands of 1.2 meters above the normal state.
In Saxony, snow walls on motorways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the meteomedia, in Saxony, the alarm level was violet - the highest level at all.
Sometimes there fell 30 cm of snow, fresh and strong winds provided confusions.
There were several trucks and cars sitting there in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind resulted in stock-finished traffic and stitch.
The A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall in Thüringen.
According to the German railway there are major disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and North Bayerns.
Snow on the slices, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed upper tubes and softs are the main problems.
In Saxony, telecommunications from Leipzig had to be discontinued to Nuremberg.
In the Thüring Hall field, an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided in train by firemen and rescue helpers with clouds, food and drinks.
Snow winds featured across the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a speaker of the Aviation Information Centre, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been deleted in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in durable operation.
Although only a few strawed passengers at the airport are still nearly 400 field beds ready for them.
On many streets, accidents occurred already on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died at the crash with a train on a train transition in Eastholstein.
The captain was easily injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads: even here a truck was recorded on a railway transition because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked up to the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had hit her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have a good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already spin up with light bows.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is searched by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its sign: according to a newspaper report, the money house seeks buyer for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its group seat beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernised, and now the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the costs of renovation - and look for a buyer for the two highhouses, as the "Financial Times Germany" calls for a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We are always checking if it is more useful to own or sell real estate itself and then re-sume back," he said.
In this way, Germany's largest credit institution will return its corporate seat within a short period of time.
The Bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from the investors of a home-owned fund and subsequently healed thoroughly.
Energy restructuring declined the data for about 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Branch experts estimate the value of the towers that are now renamed to Greentowers, according to the newspaper, to about 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are re-saled to a fund owned by the Bank or to an independent investor, the speaker said, is still open.
Thousands sad for dead friend
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the wasted mountainmen who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be safed because the safety situation is still precarious in the disaster.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 mining workers aged between 17 and 62 were wasted in days.
A sin had been left down in the disaster, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not decline for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the friends.
The bodies couldn't be locked up until now.
Now families and friends with a Memorial reminded the dead.
Ten thousand people had gathered at a bright sunlight in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They'll be quiet for two minutes.
29 tables were set up for the honors of the poured mountainmen, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the companions were seen.
Also pictures and personal items, including clothes and surf boards, found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were waved on a half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains would come back to the surface from the depths of the earth, said New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key to the attendants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he saw his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the ceiling.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomates attended the Memorial.
At the first explosion on November 19, mountains had also been destroyed by British and South African origin.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mines on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are exploded, they start cooling down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does a plate fit to the art cino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn newly lots out with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising" old genre borders.
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he played "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his punishments and lays his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and his enemies have ever scattered the wheat from the living body when he has a bad laugh.
On the other hand, the inauguration, as it is actually called, tells the whole film about no word, and also the other figures can not be crushed to one or two sentences or a few painful death crystals.
Otherwise it is silent and swallowed in the terrible beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the scenes from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cineasts with interest in existencealism and very quiet camera tours.
Fine, if a movie has several target groups, only hurt if they exclude each other.
Regissor Winding Refn has been regarded as a type of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works with a little more humor accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the Arthouse.
Most art quino friends are expected to be scared off from the sprinkling brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die at the latest in boredom when the inauguration for freely interpretable reasons breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries through ship to Jerusalem and holds an eternity in flaw and fog before the crew appears to arrive in America and remains silent there.
No wonder, therefore, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a cinema loan and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a shame because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-growing fissade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this movie it is not about dialogues or a strict action, it's all atmosphere, a film-becoming fiber space.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refran hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and cuts him with his iron pictures and the dark trance-like sound track very slowly to the throat, but especially with the incredible hatred that struggles him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small blond boy who is loyally sided with the eye keeps something like innocent, all others are driven by anger.
On most of the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who will ever become warrior of hell for enemies and temporary alliances, possibly the Ambassador of the Devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, for annoying, upset and astonishing.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA Nuclear Energy Authority has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position on this matter - it does not allow controls.
By midnight of 5 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting aircraft attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the coast of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria claims to have built with help from North Korea in the quader, hidden in a valley that departs from the power.
According to a lettering by the US foreign secret service CIA at the end of April 2008, the common reactor would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built, too, under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar.
For other purposes, however, technology from the fifties is hardly dug.
The CIA introduced a video presentation with unsharp satellite pictures.
By computer animation, she embarked on where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear center of Yongbyon.
She also presented photos that showed the building from the vicinity or even the interior.
The reactor had been certified just before the launch, it said, but it was not yet tailored with burning staves.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than at the time, and the puzzles became even more bigger.
The former US president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that before the attack, the CIA was quite sure that Syria built an reactor in El-Kibar, but hardly found evidence that there was an active nuclear program in the country.
Some Secret Services in Europe are rather cautious and speak only of a "dependent reactor", even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asking how sure he is to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in summer, which IAEA has "abundant material to ask questions".
The shoot of the claimed 'unused military building', although the Syrians quickly created aside and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008 a IAEA team was found in El-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans under the former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from a Member State directly after the attack that might be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has purchased them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always delighted to never operate a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
However, after analyzing the particles, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it refuses the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel also silences iron.
"We will never comment on this," recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 is unfinished and "is increasingly developing into a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high western diplomat at the IAEA's seat in Vienna - eventually a serious infringement of the nuclear weapon blocking agreement is in the space over which the IAEA is awakening.
The IAEA seems to see as the key to progress in informing three other facilities that are supposed to stand "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor - and are still different from that.
In this respect, the inspectors have not yet revealed the installations or functions they have or what they may seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are called Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in the IAEA internally, derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and found a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military support point - exactly with this reason, Syria refuses access to the three places of the IAEA.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to explore military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the institutions by a hint from the US Secret Services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrates material was transported to and from.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
However, where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should be distinguished later, there are plausible suspects on these key issues.
It is also unclear whether debris that could store valuable traces were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of trucks were disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the shoot has remained.
The Salzmine al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from El-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which in 1998 examined Syria as a stock of radioactive waste, is unlikely to be considered.
The former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had recently connected her with the reactor in an analysis of satellite pictures for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria took earthwork at the three suspicious places and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to eliminating the suspect.
In addition, it says in diplomat circles, the IAEA has spent several months on developing a plan for inspections there which should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only showing the effort of the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also abandoned this proposal.
Had western diplomats in Vienna yet in charge of the fact that the reactor was destroyed a year ago, so the matter has not been very urgent, about U.S. Messenger Glyn Davies has brought into play for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA-Chef Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this way: for one thing, there is a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything other than looking for an escalation.
On the other hand, how a diplomat can be considered, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed resort in summer, there is trouble.
The turnbook has written herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
A lot more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, remains in love during the Yugoslavia war in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations protested immediately, whereas some of the short-term turning days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned off in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Offer wrote about UN's UN refugee aid to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie itself is ambassador of the UN's refugee aid.
It is not diplomatic - she has already offered women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not existed, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the turnbook.
According to the United Nations Refugee Assembly, her organization recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports Guardian.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received her turnbook to read, has granted a turn permit for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not yet come.
The young author himself delights, they do not pursue political intentions with their film, have worked with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, want to show the horrible consequences of war, and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vacuum.
Thus another second synopsis on the film in the network, which then sounds quite different: The loved ones knew it before the outbreak of war and meet again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds significantly different from the variant "rape sacrifices are getting into torture slaves".
That Jolie's film actually starts before war - so much is safe.
The pressure on her, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on error information."
Now you can only provide the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the turnbook, as many as before, illegally into the network.
Nothing like away here.
This evening, it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No evidence of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans shout for joy with cracking loud music, they stamp with the feet.
The Bailey Pub in the Southern Cork shakes because the players throw and hit table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups.
"Bierpong" calls the bizarre spectacle to win there are 500 Euro wins plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the beerpong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrilling drinking game and the restraining intelligenceist, that doesn't really fit together.
Yet, the 26-year-old is trying to have fun to distract himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
On his plan, there is no play fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct an application talk in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mulmary feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had lost her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three brothers and sisters have already been looking for their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as a IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Ires will probably leave the country in the near future, predicts experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015 they even expect with 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
Contrary to the predictions, the emigration wave is comparable to those under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery that brought great prosperity to the Irish people, again grew up.
The economic crisis, in particular, uncertains the young, well-educated Irishes, for which there has been only mountains up to date.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was used, there was money in overflow.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are many readers of young immigrants who complain: "All things are going down the bach in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one then turns off the light."
Legal student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future, because the government only operates eyewashing and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how their commuters are hanging from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, whether it is to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to occupie the subject positively.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a round service on work abroad.
"For professionals, work abroad is a great chance to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website shows photos of surfer in Australia and snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery service, but also bringing freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was no more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January it continues to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan's homeland is still rare, because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says when he, after a long time, first steps over the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again."
He's laughing a little laughing and going through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine dwelling area with preserved gardens, parking large, expensive cars in the entrances.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit funded.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he said.
Does he fear it could be wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says: "I have no children to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new."
The construction engineer doesn't like the pain complaint he often hears at present.
"Nobody has to hunger - our situation is far from as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we're only feeling like Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Leave the future open and just watch how it's going with life elsewhere.
For a few years of work in London, he has already been behind himself, and why should it not work well for him and his friend in New Zealand?
But one thing is that he is worried about in these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could go to a goodbye party.
"Not too many emotions," he says, and drinks a big drink of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's rather call it a ride party, very relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These results resulted in the Latinobarometro survey, which was carried out in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change in opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly important in this year's survey of September and October.
First of all, the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown strongly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economy has grown by about 6% every year since 2002, the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakthrough last year, such a trend is recognized.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populating countries in the region, are convinced democracies, which reduces the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Graph 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisis undermines efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the world economic crisis may be because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(Only reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the rate of poverty in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen with 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong differences in atmosphere from country to country (see Graph 4).
The strong economy of Brazil and the popularity of the divorced President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflect in a widespread way of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and has increased violence crimes, this is less the case.
For the second time since the start of the survey, many surveys in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member were victims of a crime last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have decreased and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance reflects the stronger support of the private and market economy: approximately 71% of the overregional respondents indicated that the private economy is essential for development in 2007, 56% (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% stated that only the market economy can make progress in their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, stated many private companies.
According to 19% of the respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influenced country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua by Venezuela.
An electoral lap
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts were far beyond the fears of electoral helpers who hurried to the land of aid.
Overfilled election towers, multiple votes, voting certificates in Rinnstein, destroyed election rooms and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haïtians, many of whom had become homeless in January by the earthquake, struck around looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up.
A dozen of presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded the abolition of election results due to a claimed fraud.
There were partly violent protests throughout the country.
Yet, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as pretty good in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, these irregularities, as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which claims to be obliged to the unpopular separating President René Préval and its candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected selection is intended for January.
There's still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent with the voters, explains from the election hearer to the victory of the selection, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still live in tents, a small choice was feared.
On the election day, many Haïtians were prevented from voting by lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, some 250,000 certificates needed for elections were not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, heard a wave of sympathy, which drew their popularity rate by 20 points up to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether you will help you re-elect next year, depends on whether the obviously sad Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her dead husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also led the economic policy after his wife's choice, often set up budgets that did not fully take account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to spend the extra revenue on their own good thoughts.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the convention last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 resulted in further destruction.
Some regime critics of the rulers of Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which one parliamentarian struck another face and others acknowledged the government of bribes) the convention failed to approve the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now valid for the next year, which will give the President more opportunity to spend money on its own good ideas.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage requirements of the trade unions - are at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaking by economic crisiss, explained growth and poverty combating its main objectives and not the reduction in inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, rejected the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Population INDEC, which then enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a moderate way now?
It called on the private economy and the trade unions leaders to talk.
And official statements suggest that wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined growth by a major devaluation in 2002.
It may be that Cristina Fernández wants to join the rest of the world financially again.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the former redebt of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to push a deal with the money donors from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual.
However, last month, the Economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It seems that this is the first step to clean the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after its term of office has ended without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which mostly has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy brought to her will be abandoned.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she is silent and quietly lifting many political decisions from her husband.
Swak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters entitled to elect in the five districts of the city mayor and city trees. This is considered a broad evaluation of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
Due to the creation of railbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country since 1949.
Mum had the test, but only a little.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports the greater independence of Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
In the event of a presidency election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his choice two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city trees together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual events in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with crawl makers, flag-swinging mass circuits and only spermatically dressed dancers, occurred.
There was even the mandatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, and Chairman of the KMT, spoke to a KMT candidate on the evening before the election,
When a man of the crowd shot him in the face. Line was wounded and killed a surrounding audience.
Bizarrlyer is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill a line or to settle a fight with the candidate.
Independently, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and brought the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has given more voices.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, the relationships with the mainland have not been thematized.
Instead, the candidates discussed social home plans and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanans love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoids to exhaust the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan’s economy without China cannot survive.
Ma, on his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwaneses support their China policy.
The Beijing Government will continue to pursue its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a dealer to Taipeh to prepare a summit for investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It would rather wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has now invented itself.
Two years ago she was strongly weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he embarked on absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of politicians developed, and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai found great consent as presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea-smith as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires non-profit discussions.
Tsai stated publicly that their party offered a "reliable alternative" to Mas prompt approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have made better use of Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged Pragmatician Su to reject the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mass values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without it.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever more scare between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will reform his cabinet and local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP presumes that Taiwan only supports reconciliation restrictedly.
At the same time, most Taiwanans consider economic cooperation with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "I'm not giving it back any more."
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly excellent in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear on request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take place at the ceremony at the time of the nobel prize award in 2009. Now the 26-year-old Jazz-Bassistine and singer were nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since its album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the Jazz scene, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy rules that a artist may have published before publishing the album with which he was known in the broad public.
Their ambitious album from the year 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with their obscene voice and a good feeling for pop, radio and Latin music, Spalding can be compared quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a Jazz interpreter in this category of nomination Spaldings is next.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This favorite critics experienced a huge success.
Among the competitors Iyers include the "Moody 4B" of the experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a predominant favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category Contemporary Jazz, where other albums can be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received attention in the category Great Group. He thus approaches the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventure-lusty Dave Holland and its Oktett, whose Life-Ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra is listed with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestra, with three votes.
Among the nominated with connections to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and held in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, who is located in L.A., was also nominated for his mandoline concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classic albums, Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 are from the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" from Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" of the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wandererer" from the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" is nominated by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, parry for symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a gram.
Pärt's symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded on January 4, in the Disney Hall, by the LA Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The ca. 30-minute piece has the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalsolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. argued that he wrote the 15-minute piece specially for the Mandoline artist Avi Avital, who held the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestra offering for a recording of Strawinski's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumentalists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organiser Paul Jacobs, the geiger Julia Fischer and the Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
As vocalists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Precisx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, the sopranist Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moschee in Temecula gains agreement from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local Planning Committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Critists were in favour of the project to promote both terrorism and traffic stops.
However, according to a statement from the Commission of Wednesday evening, the new religious centre corresponds to local provisions and will become an aesthetic perspective.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As Americans, it makes me proud."
"It shows that justice exists."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the Centre took almost midnight, where the voices on both sides were quite equally distributed according to press Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper website.
"There's no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"American is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres also have resulted in protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violence.
His municipality with about 135 families has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wished a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtering plants.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style is supposed to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is intended to be created on the about 17.500 m2 large property at the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opposers can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacterial nature, which can live among other things from arsenics, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible without the elements that have been considered vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenics to grow."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'abroad' life," explained Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online publication of Science magazine.
Six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as scientists found out, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenics.
"What else is possible," said the co-author of Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists have to recognize life and its forms, so on bar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of discovery were given, gave rise to too widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start organic processes using other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily defined," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenal content.
Since arsenics and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that Arsen works differently from phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system, where it really smasses everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers put off the bacterium GFAJ-1 a rising arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but it can also survive in arsenics, shows that an arsen-based life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more frequent.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a physician for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenics is not new. But there was no functioning example yet.
Arsen occurred more frequently in the early years of earth, she says, so science assumed that early forms of life used it.
"There is reason for the assumption that life could have developed differently from in the early earth's age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authority.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found, according to the statement of the Los Angeles County Sheriff from Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as the unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals had stayed before a Bellflower Motel 6 nights, according to the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not give any precise information about the foundation of the dogs or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district bulls home in Downey.
Sheriff representatives found the truck and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rage, and Didi, a 10-month-old Hündin - were injured, according to the government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week in order of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the ACC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace should participate in competition.
As Peek of the Times reported on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the ACC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the pair of dogsaw to dogsaw.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their trucks in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - one boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with into their motel room.
The thick-breaking Akitas and Corgis remained in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window a split wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars as stolen on Tuesday at 6:00.
Peek promised to anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not clear whether a finder pay is paid.
The lion cries again after the judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Yorker bankruptcy judge officially blessed the "prepared" guilt plan to abolish the debt of $5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company the way for new movies and television shows.
According to the Thursday statements, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer be in the way. Barber and Birnbaum will present the somewhat spectacular studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from more than 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a Consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself brings $75 million, is directing the company. The funding is intended to stand until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the corporate management, who struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year, to help resolve their financial problems.
In August, director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, known by his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial concerns and pay out the more than 140 glyphs of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted only a few tenders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything began from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which, after monthly debates and internal disputes, was finally signed by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co. who already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who has been paid for the management of the company each month $375,000, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio only brought out a film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come into the movies at the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be generated under the government of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can rip a considerable hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic spring ropes or about 48 doses of play doh.
But you can do your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys among $80 three national toys dealers - a whale-mart, a toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although less new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are increasingly more button cell-driven toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batterys.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs ( $13, for children from 3 years of age) are peanut figures, as large as marijuana who sing a note when pressing on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, a song can be played by multiple pressures.
Several Sing-a-ma-yes sing in harmony.
WARNING: If you have started once, you can't stop anymore.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Prize $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new scarnier feet with cycling blocking, it dominates the moon-walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as dance teacher, but their parents are complaining about the lack of volume.
If you are a child of the 80's, you surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a lot of questionnaires with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a better turner with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained there are not as educative as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped after Leapfrog's first large revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Lastly there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8. The five blocks are not larger than a strike wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about compiling the blocks into words before the time goes out. It is great for an improvised letter-stabic competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
When you go to the toys shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
It can be rollshoes or a pumple dust.
The latest head cell-driven microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your dentist brush.
The bug moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through an irrigated garden.
And he'll endure some things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even passed some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped across a urban place, checked his nervous subjects and gave commands with military authority and mutilated voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, to be feared and despised for their arbitrary racities and hung to violence - to impress the audience.
"Just stand!"
"Click straight!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "as beautiful girls are like that!"
Four girls, hardly growing up in the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants stuck.
Four pairs of black pumps were in straight row.
Four ordinary hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white strips.
"For me they look averagely," noted Mr Tang.
"Models are beautiful."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a university graduation.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by downstars: 2009 reports stated that 50 officials surrounded an imbis car which was not properly established and stared to the operator until he packed up and left the place after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened urban police strips. They have been selected specially because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the gross police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly manage to improve the bad picture that the Chinese have from these city commands.
Rightly, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may apply the urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media regularly show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei struck a watcher to death when he filmed them with his phone how they hit a protest against a garbage stall.
Last year a Peking official training manual was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghaier water melon dealer suffered after a quantity of hands with five official brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China when attacking road dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
The current approach is clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by ad in October, a editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or should only serve as optical distraction.
Probably both of them.
According to job advertising, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figures and "harmonic faces".
They should be above average size - more than 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inch.
The employment relationship ends with the achieving of the 26th year of life.
According to officials, the work for women over 25 is too exhaustive.
"The most important is their image," an unnamed district official announced at the quasi government website of Rednet.com.
"Of the candidates get the job, first depends on their outer appearance, such as size, weight, face, etc."
Then come temperament and "internal qualities".
"Women Chengguan is like flower vases," he said and added, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the district district management, does not wish to accompany this description,
However, it admitted that in China sizes are not unusual in job advertising for both kinds of sex.
The same applies to uniform visions.
Whether this is equal to good appearance, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not have to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lambs or buckligen here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang spot near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel as sexist that it was so much valued.
"Find you, I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with ironic view.
Your colleague with the graves, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their statements, they do not regret the short attitude because they had more ambitious career plans than just shocking dealers through the streets to prevent them from making business.
Each morning, the stripes are dealing with about twelve road dealers who try to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on bicycle before they are chased.
"Lord Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so often!" said Mrs. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had left his nudle kitchen attached to a bicycle car temporarily abandoned.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than hard.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studys in leisure sales.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report to their male officers.
This is intended to protect them from public adversities often exposed to officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yuntan Province, after the rumor curred, Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured during the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were killed or burned.
Xindu has been spared from such violent excretions.
But disturbances are not excluded.
Only two blocks from the quiet Baonguang spot, where the female officials patroled this morning, gathered over 50 people on a street neck.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the citizen stairs instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute delay, the officials with a wrathful face pitched the way to their vehicles and went on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male stripes, remained back and turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes we go verbally."
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr Li Nursen.
"Most of the time the people start with the fight."
State prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
State prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations that were raised against him after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a commendation, the lawyers of the Senator announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most severe prosecution against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that provided for headlines across the country and displaced his career, he was considered as a possible presidential candidate for the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "joyed" over the judgment after the one year's investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could still impose a discipline punishment.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethic lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. They believe that there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first opened in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electors, helped to buy profitable orders to buy his silence over a affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure champion during an electoral campaign by Ensign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton's work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take a lobby for a year for his former employer or the whole Senate.
According to ethic experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were closely acquainted before the Affaire, disputed against the so-called ban on the spin door lobbykration.
According to the published indications, "it seems to be an agreement and the violation of the spin doors," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed very careful in taking political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to sue the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for failure of the prosecutor.
"Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (a organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the U.S. parliamentary and government circles) said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics" (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington).
"This in principle means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defense of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day, where he was told that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defense had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, had acted "in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had presented to the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going to go into the conversational details between the Ministry of Justice and me." He said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to set up the investigations for a separate complaint by the ethic group after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Bundeswahlgesetz.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money had been something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company continued Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Stabchef, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was in the Ministry of Interior for a "clicking" thing.
Mr. Ensign was also agreed to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to agree a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had terminated for lobby work.
As last year, Mr. Ensign for the first time urged the public about this affair, apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate where he had been on the fourth place in the order of the Republicans.
After he hadn't noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he sought a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, explained to the Senator that the ethics Commission is very quick to follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigations.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call makes attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the crowns in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports on Twitter about horrible witness statements.
At the end, the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgment on the death sentence of the jury falls.
But Mr. Haye's lawyers have already submitted applications to the court, explaining the reasons for an appeal and which will be addressed by the courts on years.
One of the most provoking reasons is that the intensive reporting on the process - even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has brought about a "circusatmosphere" and a so far widespread, immediate intrusion of touching details, so that the jury was inadmissiblely affected by public disarmament.
This objection could lead the Courts of Appeal to consider whether the new technologies will be necessary for new rules in the courtroom.
"As I experienced during this process, I think it is really a danger if the withdrawal of new technologies into the courtroom affects each individual's right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr Hayes' principal defense.
The Chair Judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, showed the requests by decision last week shortly and strictly back when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court objections have found that reporting on famous cases causes doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a cheeseopath from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "carneval atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the playfilm "On the escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings, which Mr Hayes' sentence a half century later considers, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications routes from the court hall, which were still unpredictable at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in processes persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some courts could be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter affair is only one of many who present Mr Hayes' lawyers in order to discuss years and thus delay a sentence.
For example, the defendants also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrible crime photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their teachers, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with awe.
The defenders argue that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a jury who had been a critic of the prosecutor and that he had exerted unacceptable pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may draw the greatest interest.
In a contemplation they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media would continuously have reappeared the flames of emotions about the case.
"A day-to-day andrange of the media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyers wrote, "which has not yet been experienced in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that the claim that these direct messages are more obscure than reports, which are slowerly remitted, is a technological perspective that impairs reporting on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that courts of appeal would often be confronted with the argument, societal and technical changes needed the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their objection, she referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting, and made it clear that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the divorce?
After a campaign of shaking words and negativeness this week, little courtesy has broken out in Washington.
Is it a real two-party co-operation or a moment of illusion before returning quickly to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the top of the Congress brought no breakthrough in the major questions that had been discussed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decisions were made.
After all that is heard, it was not a courteous discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibilities, but rather an empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems to be clear that a close interaction over a period of months allows mutual respect to arise, which eliminates the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a test phase - which calls for one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while they themselves try to consider the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters after a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting was limited to a minimum of claims or accusations on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are kilometers away from each other.
Lastly, the November election Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush Government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arise from partial passion that die again.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those on the agenda of the "lame dock session", the Republicans and democracies have little different choices than to find a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end at the end of the year, and no one supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to receive some or even everyone, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise is expected regarding the increase in unemployment funds, although only because the Republicans cannot afford that they believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich, while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased, that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation in urgent matters of the lame duck session must not forcefully lead to the permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112 convention will be called in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even unnecessary.
"After the things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Weaner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is divided by many - the courtesy leads to true cooperation.
"I see many things that happen from today to 2012, as a prefight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new republic majority in the White House and with the tea party elections which were appropriate to their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may be that they are too high in poker, they know that they have to try to reduce their promises to reduce government expenditure and to exclude health reform.
These parties are already shown in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which includes the reform of taxes and the lifting of certain taxes, the increase of pension age and the reduction of government expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, according to their own assessment, so much urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they fight very much to get only close to this number.
The greatest resistance exists in the chosen representatives of the board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston foretells two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the convention.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republican Obama challenges the government budget, taxes and health system, followed later by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of the Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgasse, as it happened in 1995, both parties need to take care of the public reaction.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
In fact, this may be an optimistic approach.
Partiality and polarisation are greater today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties view 2010 as a pure preplay for a far more widespread choice in 2012.
In this way, the courtesy that is brought to the show this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that are still separated from each other.
Sicked US document portrays Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Clepttokration" and it gives part of the bribe money and the protection money it collects to the Kreml. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the government security service are pressing out high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive living standards in Moscow, says it.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal bands.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leader moves upwards.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that in the meantime he had been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who have a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims for years and have won numerous accusations against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has resulted in surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happens in the report of the Ambassador, individuals are mentioned, and it is unheard that this happens by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with crime has led some to call it "devastated" and conclude that the government acts more like a clottocorate than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "cryshna" (a concept from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "this" or protection), which covers the police, state security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor as well as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the military are on the second stage."
"Recently, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lower level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues that the FSB is thrown money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, so called, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it's best to get protection from MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, the protection of criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, protection itself is very modest none; even those paying are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to the one or other precaution.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but at the same time he has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kreml with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucracies," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It's not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Over the country, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked at place 154 of a recent study on global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries are listed from "at least corrupt" to "most corrupt".
The disclosure of the memo of the American message, which happened after Moscow late evening, will certainly cause disappearance within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused of the errors of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kreml to claim that you solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a counterfeit and reacted angryly to the discovery that American diplomates called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that this is our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront the past
In a weakly illuminated, emphasized classroom with dirty and shining walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, known as "the slaughter", the commander remains popular in this distant former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges that have developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the government, long-term attendants are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims public confrontation with those who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time told children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community court of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time when it condemned the former Chief of the famous Tuol Slange Folter Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, endeavouring their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still a rejection and anxiety in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that explores the regime.
"For her, life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or famine.
When the Vietnamese fell and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fleeed to Thailand at the border of Cambodia.
Here they spread disturbance until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Leng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and the jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved to Anlong Veng the next generation.
But in the middle of the 1990s, when a UN peace agreement led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run to government, leading to the capitulations of Long Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not given up, was arrested in 1999 by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their gönners no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of the rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge held their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which is held throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are anchored in the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, fought around Anlang Veng in the jungle before he settled in 1998 to live as a poor rice farmer.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Long Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before the court.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the violent acts, but it is not said whether it will be pursued more than these four cases.
This has little contributed to reducing anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have been focused on in Chaem, 64 years old, which had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey in the late 1970s during the Khmer Rouge rule.
In 2007, she told representatives of the documentation centre of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damm, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening in Chaem from work on the fields came back to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun was long shadows on the dried grass, Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court preloaded them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there was no more persecution, there would be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means merging the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts, so as everything can understand."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an annex to the History Book for High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are distrustful because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
On the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path of overwucher and with plastic waste, leads to a rectangle of black russ, covered with a rusty bright roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998.
Nowom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile seller on the edge of the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she'll drop a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to collect no further armed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for the global security of nuclear material, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years the US government had tried to convince Belarus to collect no longer highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
However, officials of the U.S. Government told Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements with Belarus have been made to remove 187 pounds of armed uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's 'American Safety Summit of 47 Nations' in April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation to the former Soviet Republic to the next 2012 Summit.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Safety Summit (2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the Agreement "a very important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"As keeping high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally armable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukehenko then.
"This is our raw material... we're not gonna make dirty bombs of it and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first launch to remove the Uran Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly diluted, says official.
It was loaded in a special train, which says officially more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal.
The second launch was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the official by aeroplane.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large proportion of money flowing into the Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence", which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-dispensing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium this year.
Belarus wants to dissolve its stock by 2012, according to the Joint Agreement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States were tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenkos harsh disregard for human rights.
But the Wednesday statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key topic in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish Government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the U.S.A. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents published by Wikileaks and forwarded to the newspaper "El País" (with cable) and it is added that the former vice-president of the Government of María Teresa Fernández de la Vega asked the Spanish Government to be informed "to prove that foreign planes flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid was accused of human rights in a thousand countries including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega were discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the report of the Council "has met Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the secret service flights across the Spanish state."
"You just want to be informed" to avoid "unprepared surprise," Aguirre reports by cable.
Also, the former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish Government "will not give great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence as they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, Advocate Vicente González stated that he would not block the judicial initiative to declare the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdenful or sensitive information," explained the ambassador after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Yet, the United States was more concerned about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declared information from the CNI and the Defence Ministry.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments," regrets Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, at which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba attended, the latter commented that "though the Spanish judges were insanely concerned about their independence and what they considered appropriate," he gave his employees instructions to "prevent upgrading rhetoric comments to make the tension shaky."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the government of Zapatero could be interpreted, tolerated or deliberately ignored as possible human rights infringements, capital will be struck, even if these disclosures could have a negative effect on the US government," he stressed.
The child murderer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "mood" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she is a child, she keeps contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know her love life, which reconstructs the ABC newspaper on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman established a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
She took a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, she became known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former one never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she began a different relationship.
The chosen man was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around in the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, even accompanied by Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated themselves.
In March 2008 she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and mad because I came to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now he knows, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and let him do what he wants."
Later she mentions a message that she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get a address to which I can send you the boy."
She complains: "If he doesn't like that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll get him when I'm back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until 19 because I have to imagine a job on 20 if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she'll take her firstborn when everything's fine.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him with anyone except with my mother," a doubtful intention when considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on 1st of the month and was supposedly murdered on 10th, is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand, he is with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will go to a summer course, so I have less expenses for the babysitter."
On 17th, memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, such a shit."
On 30th, "The boy's okay. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
By Víctor, their current partner, there is one: "He shoots money for me."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are communications from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser".
"Terror a la gallega (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, a defendant hunting overseer, explains having conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single parent.
Mónica was transferred to Menorca to Palma Province Prison of the Centre for Judgment Prison yesterday.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the situation, "and she did not intend to damage the little one."
However, beforeward, she had confessed César in the bath and put his body in a bag.
Defense and State prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP in the cities Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona could play a decisive role
Following the significant increase in votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking forward to parliamentary elections - or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as the number of elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure in the 2006 regional elections was only 316.222.
On the last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising tendency - the result of the redirection of the PSC's vote share and the commitment of the PP's votership - should be stopped, the PP analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress delegates in parliamentary elections, while CiU also wins four (she has now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental significance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold or win one of its Members.
However, if the election calendar is preserved, the next date with the municipal elections will be in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) may be the tongue at the scale to end the socialist rule, in four province capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the people's party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists do not reach a majority or can react to their traditional associates (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not irrelevant that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's municipality, where it should achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP reported an increase in its share of vote in the four main cities of the province and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's conversion, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
En Lérida is the PP just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Giant, the People's Party was able to see a significant increase.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida thousands of travel paces
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistaners and Nigerians arrested by the Police Police Office of Barcelona formed the Thailand-controlled jihadist cell, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Motion to Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter were the author of the Attentates in Bombay, who demanded 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister recognises these investigations as a major significance that he assures that with the "Operation Campai" the counterfeiting device Al Qaidas has been "swaped" worldwide and "sometimes their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could be freely exceeded the borders of European and other Western countries.
The encouraged cell is not the only jihadist network that was active in Europe, so other European police units, other than the Thai investigation bodies, have also contributed to research, and it is not excluded that there will be similar attacks in the EU in the next few days as they were carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistan Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested in Thailand, another in which the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had led from Bangkok from the cells established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourists passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the name of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigation circuits underline that, although the author of this suicide, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the travel paces stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand, there are no links between the arrested in Catalonia and the murder in Bombay.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars had been sent a few days before the killing of Catalonia through a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "Command", which made an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have taken a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to make a meeting of the Tax Agreement
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally its conditions for supporting his office as Prime Minister of the Generality, which do not differ from those already in the campaign of elections and can be summarized with the priority of the economic recovery and the absence of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the peak of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party addressed with certainty to Artur Mas, which gave her the 18 Members who had won it last Sunday - a number that is more than enough to feel indispensable, because the candidate of the CiU CU citizen regionalist party requires that at least one of the opposition parties will be held in the vote at its office.
The future alliances that regionalists want to join in the future parliamentary elections depend on a possible enthusiasm with the PP. However, the discussions with the other party leaders at the moment are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC party chairman, it calls for the support of the official accession "all discourses relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the state and the autonomous region - similar to the Basque country - and which even the CU Head of the Parties wants to be subject to a referendum.
Both political leaders are common that they want to slimen the built-up political devices of regional administration and eliminate heritage and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the official entry of Mas are discussed on the side of the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old nurse confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Altenheim in Olot do not exclude that their career killed over eleven elderly people
The responsibles of the La Caritat Hospital in Olot, Germany, gave yesterday a press conference in which they revealed the damage of the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the career who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the institution.
Joan Sala, the head of the old nursing home, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social status loss because it had not found the criminal acts of the nurse in time, but now also pay a high compensation sum calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he has been murdering since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients from the old nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor personally had examined the dead but the formalities were handled by phone because of their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat denied this point around and explained that "excessive measures could not have been the reason for the events at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there were no indications of a person's violent actions other than the defendant."
The first crime committed on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with a overdose of insulin, compared to the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different reassurance agents.
The head of La Caritat declared that the access of staff to the medicines is hard to control.
The insulin syringes and the reassurance cocktail used the nurse in six out of nine crimes to liberate patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila lies and actually chose a less horrible death for his first victims or whether he burned them out inside by giving them bleaching leather, as he had done in three women he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, the nursing's statements are not believed, not even as regards the number of suspected murders that could be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it would not make sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to inform them of the scope of these events of justice.
European Central Bank threats (ECB)
The investors strongly responded yesterday to the threat of the ECB's President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction ability."
The risk increases in the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB is able to deceive and that the euro has little to do with points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illicit market, which, in the extent that it recalls, recalls, but as a result of the closing of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, which the ECB must make a withdrawal for the fourth time tomorrow in two years, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the cessation of the plan to purchase government debts as they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly tenders with unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the programme to continue to buy obligations and to issue a strengthening signal.
If the created expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be rejected yesterday, and when the neck is persisted in taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Similarly as at the ECB meeting in May, where the Bank confirmed not to consider the purchase of government debt securities and collapse the markets thereafter, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new breakdown of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year national titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's asset management amounted to only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 base points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 000 million short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are transferred.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it has not recognized the problem with stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable in the framework of the rescue plan and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary consent to its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made its discourse more moderate in terms of the summit of the Heads of State and government on 14 December. There is political unit asked to show that we play the same partition together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, such as in the financial institutions, reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and labour procurement measures. measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange added by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, and we therefore put on a strong demand that will remove all doubts about our indebtedness.
The application of a aid plan would be a sacrifice for Spain.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The tax office has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife: "Now counts not only being, but also the appearance."
Just courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Chairman of Eulen, on his children's request, appeals to the Association Assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, does not run away.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate gürpe, will fight El Enebro's company assembly, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he thinks they are "absolutely invalid". His children will try to receive a majority to control the management bodies of the company - the owner of the Weingut Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute to control a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for corporate services does not seem to be willing to impose the control of El Enebro's bodies in his case.
He was exposed from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, which were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders meeting of 18 January of this year, which has already been complained in the trade register.
The company assembly of El Enebro, which was called by the Judge of the Commercial Court of Madrid No 2 for the 16th, has launched a new thunderstorm in the shot of the Álvarez family.
The call of the Judge to appeal to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convergence of the meeting of the Society.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "deprecated fund of applicants - his five children - to recognize the annulment of the assembly of 18 January, as official speakers explain.
This argument is the basis for the contemplation of the congregation in the afternoon to explain it as "absolutely invalid".
In June, the same protagonists who were discreetly silent, tried unfairly to invoke a congregation on a judgely way.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, calls for the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the case which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the appeal for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, their history has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes in this ready universe.
At first, no one took note of the newman and, despite his steep rising progress during the last season, in last November, all sat on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in hands and thus created a victory team became a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software to simulate processes that the German company introduced in 2007 for purposes not related to author designers.
This PLM program was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid mistakes and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russworm, head of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in the formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be identified on the race and tests can be designed and executed.
Russworm argues that in 1992, on the racing sites, on average ten technicians were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bulls team, 180 highly qualified young people are now busy. With powerful EDV systems, they are conducting analysis and any possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which only Renault is responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to reality within less than 24 hours from the simulator's virtual reality, thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that may spend a formula 1 team for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built his high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of his racing cars in a 50 km away from London.
It is two buildings where visits are strongly restricted, especially by journalists.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls real formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources that the Energy-Drink Manufacturer places in the services of his participation on the racing routes, further protagonists hide, whose support is inestimable and whose familiarity is equal to zero.
Steve Nevey, Head of Technology, stressed that five years ago it was still possible to say that progress in R & D was 50 percent in the victory of R & D and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, and the technology is 85 percent of the success while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open its own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) entered his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday.
It is the first one of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each, which intends to open the multi in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees with the 16 existing sales areas in the multimark operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP España, Helena Herrero, named as an example the rebuilt shop at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, which has cooperated with HP for thirty years.
The North American company group intends to set up 200 sales stations in Europe until 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first were dedicated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrra did not want to betray the future new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The vice-president, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for loading is always the same. They are based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive loading equipment (with interactive products to address). In Europe all stores will look equal.
In addition, HP is responsible for training the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it wasn't a Franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales office network is intended to optimise the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized enterprises in shopping and afterwards, even packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days in ten minutes."
"This system was developed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, since large companies already have their technical customer service contracts," Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years to steal a million customers.
The business leader of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first of all, he discards a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it is predicting the breakdown of interest rates that banks are trying to compensate for increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - an existing expertise.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years and thus survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guide plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if you withdraw the clients who will lose the bank - which is the major challenge for this bank, because it has given its business customers more attention than its private customers until now.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers are more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speaking outerity, cost reduction. The challenges faced by the Bank will present it together with the annual accounting report.
Only a few banks are dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, since all the plans of the banks have been broken up worldwide through the financial crisis.
Sabadell will conclude its four-year guide plan Optima, which was initially interpreted for three years, but as a result of the market situation, he was extended by one business year.
The customers who are leaving the savings are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficulty" year "with a large range".
The manager assumes that Spain would only come out "slowly" from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" in two or three years "to create work" - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war of liabilities - which will be punishing the interest margins - will run away, the risk subsidies, banks and savings funds will have to pay for their emissions for the acquisition of liquidity, as a compensation for diminishing profit margins, will already be dealt with the price of loans.
"The subjects of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credits."
"We have not turned off the hahn, but the interest differences are very high," Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto issued the order on its branch network to limit the allocation of long-term loans and increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks currently pursued the state of "increasing fees", but "in a framework characterised by competition".
Sabadell's guide plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative businesses.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "greater companies are necessary."
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing greatly" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be abolished in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the monetary market in the case of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary closure of the markets, he disregards the argument of some bankers who already prophesy a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be circulated, but in contrast to the events in June, it is possible to achieve short-term funding on repo-transactions and thus capture the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of spare boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a fusion wave of the spare boxes and stressed the speed with which the industry was restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish spare box began, several spare boxes did not take part in it in the first phase. They kept the second round ahead.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkasses Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. Cajasol's involvement in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adaptations."
"The majority is completed. It may be that we have 13 or 14 instead of seventeen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Corporation and Manager of Aragoniens (ADEA), Olavarrieta concluded that the concentration process "was carried out as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limited course that was established in earlier times, not now, in the context of the Banco de España business plans," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 spare boxes with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with each 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 per cent, and they are now much greater, with which we have fulfilled the Baseler Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained, "There would be a number of irregular opinions on the slowness of the process which revealed unseriousness and ignorance," because "Banco de España admonishes us to conclude timely before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "possibly" in the world and added that those who doubted this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy, we have to "no concern" about the situation of financial institutions and the savings funds which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process, which will be carried out "at the same time as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July had been very good.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to retain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have led to a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of time-working companies or abolition of the 426 euro support for unemployed persons, which does not involve unemployment, up to a privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of state lotteries.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who has challenged the current crisis.
How are these operations to be understood?
It should be predicted that Merkels' position is not a mistake of their public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective for the design of our future, which conflicts with maintaining the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistances in Europe, there are three possible ways of speculating from the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: the re-introduction of the German Mark - even though it sounds more like Science Fiction at present - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Third: a change in the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means more macroeconomic control, rigorous budgetary management, punishment of countries that violate the rules, the payment of certain countries and the expansion of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been distinguished for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, 2009, as the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficiencies and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of dispute between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Middle European country, when Merkel expired the decision on Greece's rescue painfully.
It was strongly criticized at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel has a clear position in the last October, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country and to oblige private loan providers to carry part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, as it pushed forward the Ireland crisis and all of the following.
Their proposal, however, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not mean to exceed it.
It tells everyone that – even though unpopular measures need to be taken now – from this date the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist.
In 2013, the birth year will be a new currency in which the counterparty countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare themselves incapable of payment and, in this case, to take part of the costs of the private sector.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measurement of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external sales.
The other alternative based on debt and buildings with huge holes in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in tree times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not only about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat on ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will be more restful.
And that we will use the possibilities that are offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in their own house has prepared their way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not seem that something would change.
Among the possibilities considered, we should not exclude the euro area that has been fully stopped with little serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has warned us.
Sports and circumference
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The suspected exclusion of two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink about whether it was an importable act or not and whether both players should be sancted by the UEFA.
As generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the sanction required at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee punished the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten, but in this sport - rules.
Part of the upcoming debate on the present case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which pretends in his hymne preciousness and honor and at other times punished its players for similar events) played the main role in it, and to the dramaization by Mourinho, which added a episode more to his long history than theatral and provocating technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether these practices, which are not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradict the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are a rule circumference.
In this case, the damage caused by the spirit of sport should be examined.
The spirit of sport defends the physical integrity of counterplayers, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the contradictory players draw an unjustified benefit from the counter team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand under false game or rule circumference, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the sanction with joy.
Another question is what kind of advantage the contradictors took from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was not brought into a more disadvantaged position or benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is evidently that the players start the next play phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually eliminate. Furthermore, with this approach, the players receive a sanction and go into the second card cycle, in which they eliminate less than in the first cycle because of card collection.
It is not so clear whether it is really a advantage.
Finally, such practices do not contradict the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions in order to benefit as much as possible from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumference), they would rather choose when they underline them.
They made a strategic decision to escape without a punishment or flee from it.
Although the boundary between invention and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that polemics were caused by two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transfer.
The damage that has been added to the principles of sport through these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offensive for customer fishing for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar leaves a lawine of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December this year.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lotterie, there are also group evenings that lead to Barcelona's restaurant and recreational industry during the past Christmas season. However, because of the economic crisis, they resolve a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations in question.
In order to make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on one Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of reservations from dinner to two top participants (the 16 and 17) and almost no orders in the previous week.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group evenings for budgetary reasons.
In order not to abstain from this tradition, many workers pay them from their own pocket.
Whatever the economy is, lowest prices are required, the chairman of the Barcelona Guest Station, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
The representative of the rooftop association does not dare to predict how the holidays will look in this month.
"The people are thinking about it ten times before they reserve."
"They would like to go out, but they pay strong attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will be good for those who " offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and calls us to remember that customers save in crisis times, and therefore prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, it appears that the evening of December 17 the suppliers are going to collapse.
The Group of Soteras says that the demands for this Friday would grow with the intention of spending less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, who maintains 16 guest places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the property of the calendar has led to preferential reservations, even from early November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, who leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 locals, optimism is not lost after the second quarter, the revenues have flown again and well, even though the prospects for Christmas business are focused on a few days.
Sources of the company group highlight that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with friends who celebrate Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price heat. You have the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
Some companies also see green sprouts, so the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group food is in progress again.
On the side of the Fecasarm roof association (with mergers such as the Barcelona Kneipen, Restaurant and recreational association), the vice-president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "liveful", although the customers "suppress a maximum".
But the fun of celebration did not go back, no matter who pays.
The Pakistanian nuclear programme is a major concern in the United States
Islamabad creates nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistan nuclear programme Washington.
At the edge of the clearing and soft details offering the documents on the content of the conversations and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but, on the contrary, "reduces" and that the instable Asian country creates more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not composed, but their individual parts are stored in order to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - prepares Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the suspected spreading of nuclear material and the sensitivity of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implied in the nuclear and missile programmes is regarded not only by the United States but also by Russia as out-of-the-spot and reason to take care of them.
"Pakistan has to set up strictly believed personnel to monitor nuclear plants; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities for people who cooperate in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korollev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a discussion with his North American officials.
New on the internet portal of Julian Assange revealed is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear dissemination and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", explains: "There is still no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit by the chief leader of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "preach to the responsible" that "Pakistan's army has to set up his silent support for terrorist groups."
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol gives a red warning about the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the situation is difficult to explain.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red warning" about "invention and persecution" by Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
In addition, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to make in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the International Police Authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order on Sweden's request, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the power.
This is what is happening. The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find Assange, "to take him provisionally and deliver it."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organisation, consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyer, who last published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the trip from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who received the corresponding authorisation with the state-owned Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security officer.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," is accused by the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia depends on her son's innocentness - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview from an unspecified place to the head of the magazine Time per Skype. He requested the withdrawal of the US State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, it would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who declared the request for withdrawal as "shameful and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the transmitter CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to give less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions of conservative politicians and commentators today.
The Congress Assembly, Peter King, who will be chaired by the National Security Committee of the House from January, has invited the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to hire their funds and to pursue anyone who supports it or contributes it."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Hokkabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, whoever had the government to suck information, he was guilty of the betrayal and all that is not execution is none too mild punishment," he explained to the transmitter Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eyewitcher to the Carod Nearby
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its existence in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full-meeting principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the fifty time an internal upheaval in the series of 11 Members and half of the votes of the votes without direction.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not sufficient to the nearby of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that today the influence of this sector is as weak as its Mentor itself and will not cause him the same headbreaking as other former flows.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with an eyetwinker, which would safeguard his position until the next municipal elections.
At the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional members of the ERC could express themselves secretly on his remaining in the office.
With electoral lists, not with lifted hand.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penalty mark to the President, they could do this without fear of repressalia.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and of submission to his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel with half the voices plus one not confirmed, and he added without indicating percentage values, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod nearby demands that the President make more available than only the party's office. A insufficient gesture, as Puigcercós controls the top body of the conventions.
However, since they do not have sufficient majority to force retirements, they will agree with the Board of Directors a plan of action from now to May.
They expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will be presented to the Council to vote on 18th.
Their intention is to bour for Puigcercós, which, in return, is to promise to present the convention in the autumn of 2011, which the party top already considers to be a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" damages the stability and he seeks forever to enable the organisation to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovació thought it was a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted five of them, two of them standing in the front.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the Board of Directors, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great news.
Hugueet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the full-communication principle as a functional way.
In this way, he contradicts a reform of the statutes which will allow the conventions with chosen delegates to be held.
From the end of the full-meeting model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which was already fighting for this at the last two conventions.
Actually, at the Moving Assembly of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of the full assembly at a convention to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date remains, since the internal revolt of the last few years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the ground, the time could have come to reappear this matter and finish forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China explained at the COP16 that its country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China holds its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of that country at the COP16.
At its first public appearance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon traces and to convert its industry.
He argued that over the last four years his country has invested $245 million in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutional development and support of pilot programmes.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China the authorities of the Federal States had cooperated with those of the Central State and the municipalities in order to achieve the objectives of saving energy, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also carried out, has already taken on or completed several years of plans, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for the effective use of energy that has been introduced in the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
He explained that there is also a project on provinces of climate change, another project for the exchange of traditional glue bears through energy saving bears and another for the deterioration and adaptation.
Martin Krol, scientific government adviser in climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than generally accepted.
He showed that the individual emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tonnes per person while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years and is intended to take place by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panistic party chairman had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was granted to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN Party Chairman had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right was granted to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint of Gabino Cué Montegudos as the governor of the state, he stated that Espinos was excluded as a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Here Espino has the right to turn to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case, in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he declared that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance to the President's candidates had never been negotiated.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December in which his follower was elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he executed.
The panistic leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman which the Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so he would give the fat to those who would be determined by the Council.
"I am quite unaware and open there. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that the upturn of the party recorded in the last elections of 4 July will reflect in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it's about supporting governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments, which emphasized from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would be carrying the flag and being observed throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and longings are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his discursive course in the context of his four-year government, César Nava called the attendants of the PRI to think about the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the federal government could express such words as those he could make in his discourse in Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no oral ban in that country and even less a censur.
Obama works in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are in favour of the adoption of the Dream Act - the Law, then call your senators and urge the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twittered in the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported the country-wide mobilisation in support of the Dream Act - Law on the legalisation of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - the Law, then call on your senators and urge the adoption of this law," Twitterd Obama.
His short message contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that calls on the public to contact their senators in addition, as the vote of the law is about to come.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was distributed after the 42 republic senators were threatened to block all the voices for every law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government would be extended.
Such a blockade announced on a letter signed by the 42 republic senators could have an effect on the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Concerning the blockade of the Republicans of the Law of Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that, once the tax theme was solved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be set up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on it at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although more likely next week.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Dream would legalize about 800 000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old, during the last five years of living in that country and were enrolled in a higher educational institution or in the army.
But the defenders of the law need 60 votes to adopt the initiative, and therefore they are dependent on the voices of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organisations of the predictors of this project organise an intense influence on the adoption of the law.
The democratics, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said that he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other democracies should decide to turn back to the initiative.
Among the most renowned Republicans are the Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they declared that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his attitude.
Although the representative house has a different version, analytics agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The desire for the language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was supposed to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of her question at this time (on another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "Make us in trouble," the Argentine scripture spooked sweetly against the audience, mainly composed of young people who met at the International Book fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this modernized table of Marisol Shultz, which took part in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she devoted to Gonzalo Celorio and then marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what a "wound" is, and is going from doctor to doctor, of which she does not receive any answer, but is the instructions for the guide of her story.
The infectologist leaves her convincedly, "Please not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the gang, and who explains her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalytist reveals the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story sucks lightened and concludes that she only learned "of the wound that it was really open and not existing". But she is convinced that the desire for the language and their traps would mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story, which he called 'Lob of Invention' and where the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
He tells of a famous magic woman who touched the clouds, brought back far traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn and reported about America, the great novel, who from the beginning was not missing to his own chroniist, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflow of the stories that the conquerors have told.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the misleaded witnesses who appeared in the stories represented as true but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with instructional power that even the embarrassment came away."
However, he emphasizes, "is it the crazy and liars who imagine things the best" and there, reality and lies are approaching each other, where one no longer knows the side of the story, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in line, the writer commented and praised the diversity of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Ricon devoted their contribution to the great wound of social violence, which affects her country - as well as Latin America - as a result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not deliberately planned commitment," she explained, after highlighting that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution is also "the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-living world the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also go beyond dogmatism, and is forgotten, "that behind every confirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thought and the reality, we need to nuancize: and Nuancizing often means laying the finger in the wound and disturbing those who feel much more well when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also disturbing the mighty ones who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to discover a sense of writing again.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in end games, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles, prescribed by their respective trainers, and the meetings marked by contrasts are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in end games, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he has played decisive games, and so far he has been well, why this opportunity is of very particular importance for him.
The Argentinian has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has been a step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has spent together with the same team at the end of the game.
The Sanist Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when part Morelia had the tears in hand with which he heard a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to start a relapse again, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros ended unavoidably after 210 games minutes, but at the eleven meter he came with 3-1 forward and got two ways to record his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two end games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted again by accident and be freed from the evil magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my devotion, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the taxman when he was asked about the lost end games.
The last end game has remained strong in his memory, he assured to have learned much of it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not peep the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were already prepared with two elf meters to eliminate it, and I think that this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elf-meter shoots, he is not worried, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elf-meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared for it, we were prepared in the previous tour, but unfortunately, the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the violent struggle to keep the title already in hands that left us something for this end game, and we hope that this time it will not happen."
It is in Romanso power to be no longer just a second champion and to cost the glory that the titles bring.
The United States amends the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves before their conversation at the Consulate at the Service Offices for the application of a visa; the cost of waiting periods will be shortened.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa are amended in the United States' message and in the Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their conversation at the Consulate at the Service Offices for Visum Application (ASC, the Initial Letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which are reviewed by the Consulate before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the settlement of the visa are declined because it is no longer necessary to pay the date agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered separately.
The applicant shall only pay one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the contrary to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who just want to extend their visa do not have to talk in the consulate, they only have to imagine the next ASC where they are presented and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the Consulate remain less time there than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo have no longer to pay the $26 service charge.

NASA announces the find of alien life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present a find tomorrow which will have an impact on the search for living in the All.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will make known tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was called, the NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for alien life", which caused speculations with experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in enemy surroundings, which were thought to be inhabitable, human-like creatures. It was raised the hypothesis that if their living conditions improved, they could transform themselves into intelligent creatures, such as humans.
It seems to be a microbe found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that was considered to be too toxic for all possible forms of life, since the lake is strongly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances that there can be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenics, as the astrobiologists state, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that is different from the one we know."
Tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference, the space agency will announce the actual scope of its fund.
At the conference, geobiologists Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on the Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) in the question of whether his chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron form an opposition block
The reform of the institutional law on the Congress introduces the two-party system, they regret.
The 60th Legislature period had just begun, and already a opposition block was installed by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined to be independent. The four questioned: the entry of the 'twin parties' system into the chamber.
Before the start of the opening session in the 60th Legislatur period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo contested the reform of the institutional law as they were excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, would introduce a 'two parties' system, because now there are two people, the same number as parties who controlled the convention.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau referred to by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political contemplation with these reforms.
He argued that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the schedule, and they went out of the political will and if they did not have it, they would again be unfair from both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until this time I come (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez by Convergencia explained that there were conformities with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would be a pluralist group.
It cannot be approved, he continued that after being monopolistic, the convention should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that a everlasting two-party system is to be ruled in the Congress."
"In the beginning, this group begins with five Members and they talk to other colleagues and colleagues to make them more," explained the Convergencia Member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT said in play on PAN and PRI that the convention has currently turned into a 'bate' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they divide them into two."
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to place them in the negotiations.
"The five, which are currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite in order to take our place at the table of negotiations, because because of the reform which has been carried out and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200,000 more Peso for "the supplier"
The city management of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over a little more than 200,000 Peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
The sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this check issued on a amount of 200.144,56 Peso was issued with the number 9258447 last 16 November with the purpose of "accounting open bills".
Honeymaster Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the community would go to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold at high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum that is still guilty of her and, as a result, the number of checks still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought with her, it's just paid the debts, as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "dive" in the last quarter of the year "recovered": 24 September, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last of November 16th.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is legally required, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the tax master assured that their services would not be re-accessed.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million Pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where they entered checks in value of more than 3 million Peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the inbreak of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourism industry requested to pay particular attention to the authorities, the areas that are in a bad state and throw a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, reminded us that on various occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions of tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and pathways would have been negative, as the tourists would come to swallow and see the disorder, whereby they would turn back to the nearby stores.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't care how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't slowly and planlessly carry out the construction work in this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist’s crash would have made attention to the lack of prevention and maintenance work on the sides of the city.
"The municipality must take on its responsibility and avoid what happens again. How to do so? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of everything in the afternoon," he explained.
"We have a longing to have a clean city. For not only because it is a tourism area, it must be maintained, we inhabitants also have a right to a clean living area. The city administration must change its strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that also look unpleasant and incomplete," he said, "e.g. el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that cleanses its beaches and streets and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in shot," he added.
"These measures have not been given sufficient attention and this kind of incidents reveal what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, secretary of Promoción Turisstica, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they were not properly used and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought on frontman together with the city. The city should be Priority to make clean, orderly and attractive for tourism.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural places that have to be cleaned and cleaned first to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP requires results from the convention
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members take on the great responsibility to give a model of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business industry calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreements, to the parties and to the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was devoted, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and another of PVEM, which makes 40 people representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a clean work, to feel obliged to the society and to the different social groups that are dependent on responsible parliamentary work and that they do not repeat the same pattern of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Coordination Council of Entrepreneurs, proposed that the new Members take on the great responsibility to give a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, transforming them into cornevals compositions of the rulers and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they do a reliable work and take advantage of society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people's representatives is the driving and joint work for the economic growth of the State, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs."
As regards the tourism sector, he asked the new Members to give the services to the Ministry of Tourism the necessary job value in the state budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the two-third resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings exchanges and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agriculture industry."
Tourism projects must be allocated to funds, state security must be supported and the alcohol law which has not been re-established during previous legislative periods must be updated.
Holy King Searched
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys desire the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfil these wishes on the next three-king day, because the budget is no more than twelve people and a goat bock.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothes that they want.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes hard times are said because my husband has no job, but we sell Mandarins and potatoes... I'll go to the street with the dawns," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie pop.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has long been looking for a 'monster car' and for his eight-month old brother Jesus suggests Cayetana clothing in size for one-years.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster', but I replied to him, 'Let us wait, boy', because it was very expensive', Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12 and the ten-year-old Isaias has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is searched' by spending a toy or cash in the Reception Hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, a production and sales network of cannabis was destroyed by ten house searches in the Estrie administrative region.
Fourteen persons have been arrested and will be charged with various accusations.
The house searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served mainly in the manufacture of drugs.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashics, cash money and equipment served by production have been confiscated," stated Louis Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Quebec Security Police.
Altogether, 11 men and three women were arrested, of which two of the men who are considered to be the main wire draggers of the drug ring came from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are supposed to have appeared in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest before the judicial building.
They could be accused, among other things, of the accusation of the production of cannabis, of its possessions for sale, of the complot and of the service of crime.
These house searches had been carried out as a result of a long-term exploration activity that took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public has made it possible for us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the Estrien Regional Detection Unit of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Service and Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be pursued without problems
The draft law of the conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to regulate the problem of the ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be suspended after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I reject this charter with emphasis."
"I am holding with a party that has put your feet on your feet," explained Michael Ignatieff, Head of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Cucus meeting in front of the Members gathered.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which allows to hold any person who is identified for the transport of illegal immigrants for up to a year, violates the Canadian Law and Freedom Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, Head of Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government is doing," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the issue of immigration by Olivia Chow, NDP, has proved the critics of the hand that demand that their party behave not stable enough toward the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree with taking measures against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to implement by intermediating another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of conservatives because he is looking for the guilt of refugees and keeps children caught for at least a year," explained Chow.
Immigration minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties to play with politics and to ignore the Canadian will.
"The Canadians strongly inform the Members that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these crimes affecting Canada and treating the country as a footboat."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," says Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative person has said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a vote in order for each opposing Member to declare himself immediately to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possibility of establishing a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collision since Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister for Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
Since 1870, the metropole has a standing unit against corruption.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutils' presence.
It was also not lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in punctuation of public security as "made rabbit-made from the hat" and "to a table-based solution".
Minister Dutil, on his part, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the questionable future unity.
"You will see the result when we will proclaim it," he satisfied to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest persists in trying to prevent the education of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and politics at the ENA (state of the University for the Education of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes Quebec to grant the financial audit control a special mandate so that it can conduct research on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of the test control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners to the audit control, which would also allow it to engage people in the statement.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government drawers.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to change the penalty law to do so in order to be better aligned with this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the judicial proceedings in this kind of criminal prosecution are not clear.
Vic Toews, State Secretary of Public Security, confirmed that his colleague of the Court, Rob Nicholson, was currently distinguished with certain novellings relating to this file.
During the 2001 Operation Printemps, which concernd the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelled.
Ottawa has implemented the law against gangstership as a result.
Flows under strict monitoring
Several river races remain under strict supervision because of the high rainfall that has been cast in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a drought on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, there was a further drought in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street has sink into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters of rain fell into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of rainfall was expected according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
This was a total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers.
Since these rainfalles include the snow melting that has already been gathered in certain sub-areas, the violation of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service proclaimed warning warning on the flood warning on the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudia.
The river races in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière are here to be the object of surveillance and continue to be observed.
In the region of Lanaudière, the violent rainfall of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon have taken place.
In Saint-Calixte, a bridge of resistance was scattered due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes has caused the closing of several streets, especially in the Municipality of Mansfield-et-Ponte fraction.
The security service remains in alarm and monitors the situation, according to Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Highwater Centre issued warning warning about the strong increase of several rivers, especially by Machinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reproved
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social care and Haitians as well as because of his absurd speech on radio.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements "whose information on social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians and also contain such a unbelievable speech that is not appropriate for the day-rounded consignments."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a debate on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, is in breach of the Code of Radio Transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 consignments.
The first decision was made as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personen assistées socials du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading.
On the subject of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont held that suicide was an expression of cowardity.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the communicated message was that suicide should not be considered a solution to life crisis.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the "Dupont le midi" mission would have cut a sensitive topic in family justice and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not incurred with any tadel toward his person.
The last issue was the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective discussion that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI-Moderator had explained that he had not donated in favour of the Haiti aid, since it was not sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abused, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I've already reimbursed my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My file has been virgin for one and a half years," explained the modern.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board proposes the spread of an unprecedented expression.
In all cases, the CHOI FM has acted on radio broadcasters "behind his obligations".
The consequences for the radio broadcaster, which, inter alia, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are small.
King of King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who brills in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai box, is now looking for new challenges to the Tatami and to the boxing rings of the world.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with struggle sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," explained Zemmal, who has been resident in the metropolis since 2008 to continue to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, since for those who present the soil struggle, like the mixed arts of fighting, they don't like competitions in North America."
Recently, his sign as a security officer and the UPS employee had issued bad news to his rivals in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) in Edinburgh, Scotland, the World Championship of the Amateur.
"I won the victory in the categories of the full contact Kickboxen and the Thai Box," he explained.
"I'm preparing for the world pocal in San Shou, China."
"There had been invited those fighters from every category who had placed themselves under the last world championship among the first four."
"I babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"2005 I became behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I ended the tournament in China on the fifth place while I became third party in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, which allow flashes and footsteps as well as soil throws.
The two fights usually play on a platform, rarer in a boxing ring.
The most renowned box fighter, who has been found from this kind of fighting sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, who is well known in the world of battle arts.
If Nacer Zemmal kept only one single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most viewed in China," explained the sympathetic poundcarl.
"It is a little like the equivalent to the stadium lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"It was a super experience."
Zemmal in the half-finale of his category (80kg) had won his first battle before he then lost at the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of halffinals meet each other at the end of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer their heads to crown a single champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has granted 450 million dollars to contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert in mutual agreement.
In the middle of this lawine of more than 100 contracts, there is a consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, namely the project management, to a total of $295 million without tendering.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as accompanying the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector to overcome its responsibility for this important hydroelectric project at a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium "Energie gérance" admitted the lucrative contract without a public procurement.
For the Partie Québécois, the withdrawal of corporate consortia constitutes a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortion of competition and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a shortened game and disregards competition."
"This means that in the open form, instead of carded games are now carried out in secret form," stated Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
On the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how public interest can be used in this way.
Response Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by saying that this treaty was a short game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she betted by strengthening that the PQ was done "unreasonable" and it "misses her in hardship."
She said it was "the least" that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is a world-wide practice.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise with regard to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its work programme.
The construction process is in progress and is supposed to be set up by 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without the possibility of a competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, even in relatively simple projects, the Consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" said last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of construction engineering and consultancy is subject to government investigations.
A short surveillance of the Quebec Company Register allows you to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works together in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of it, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely to thoseu.
As regards the "Energie gérance" Consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of Many James is subject to a special workforce dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has invoked this fact in a special manner since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued an explanation which has allowed the nose to rubble the fact that the contract on the project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are only few candidates, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two possibilities: either you take the people who are on this night and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the individuals," confirmed Laports.
This contract granted to the Consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for over 50,000 dollars received by the Party Québécois.
The contracts were either approved by the hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following a review, the "Le Devoir" newspaper included more than 100 engineering and advisory contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had made 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without taking into account their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They are totally $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had justified that the PQ was equally connected with the companies they "financed" before she clarified that it was their leaders.
Barometer conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but inconsistent skeptical.
The Quebec Consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also not in the marked brands or eco-labels to control his choice.
Unfortunately, although it is bathing in a media-effective universe, where information for a conscious consumption is only so dizzy: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to regret, an inadequacy that is known as the brake of his commitment, as shown by the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of the so-called socially tolerable products in 2010, Quebec seems to be the ones who try to sell them to pay little credit.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admit that, in fact, to give the environmental involvement of companies as little faith as the green business advertising, the measurement instrument which is declared by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke shows.
Another find: half of consumers doubt the confidentiality of official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally aware, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously from only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently only one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, emptyness and doubtful character of the information depressed the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer according to the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of Quebec's ability to achieve green products and services, which they are strived to put on their hands, is mistrusted.
According to another communication, over half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their convictions.
According to Barometers, they also prefered 61% of the sales of traders in their urban district and favoured the purchase of food cultivated in their region.
Greener and responsible conscious - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, trying to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop from its car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebec's have indicated, used public transport in 2010 or prefered the riding centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the cliché ideas, have also supported the advance and bicycle ride.
State liabilities for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallelèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallelèle, who had hoped to make a contribution of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris cinematic complex belonging to Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to resume this actual cineastic function, seems not to receive what they demanded.
Although the government has accepted to engage in this matter, however, under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond in less than the initially expected height, which could bring an existing solution to beneficial conditions, at least the sources that can be removed from the State's rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the bitt request has been corrected since the re-sumption.
A proposal, together with an action plan, was already sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is directing the Act eXcentris.
A few days ago, he had a final report to her.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was submitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallelèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to answer them.
In any case, the premises of government donations seem to have been truly pushed off.
Let us remember that the Quebec Ownership of the Kino and Kino complexes had rejected a direct government investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Cultural Minister had no financial assistance for real estate projects there which he did not also allow other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants of the segment claimed substantial economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author quiz in the rooms of his cinema complex for more than ten years after the self-financed design of the cinema, which could justify the exemption from the State Cash.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his client at the bar.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallelèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, on their part launches a privately funded campaign, of which she hopes a total of $700 000 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not prompt the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the corrected proposals that were made to them.
Mystery of the complex shaking Canada ventilated
The new American diplomat lines distributed by WikiLeaks were lying to the secret of what the United Nations consider under the Canadian Minority Complex to the Americans, but with the same stroke they open the sensation of superiority to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voters did not mean Canadian-American relations, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, provide even more picky details than the mere substance content that you have to nail at.
A connection dating 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period during which the federal election campaign was fully available, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participated in the actions discussed by their political managers.
For the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador set up in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanatory possibilities for this situation.
"A Canadian inhabitant minority complex, which may lead the Canadian, political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to the United States in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade), he describes.
Thus, he concludes, the United Nations are "the vocal Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it".
The Ambassador understands this "ear deaf silence" less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he rated, "it was supposed to be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such a essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in mind at the first time."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the message sent by Terry Breese, business manager in Ottawa on January 22, 2009, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's continued existence in the trust voting on the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada's first deficit will be announced after more than a decade, resulting from an exercising programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," says Breese.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to hold the Parliament's meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling down by the coalition and that the resistance of opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed exercising programme.
Another, dating from January 2008, and written by Ambassador Wilkins, Washington agrees to the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series of CBC is spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle plays can be seen at Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also discourses for the purposes of hearings performed by the CIA muscle prots.
Another communication reports in detail about how Hillary Clints asked Bernard Kouchner, their French official colleagues, at their first bilateral meeting, whether Europe is willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is supposed to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "cause of case".
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he delivered a paper to the State Secretary in punkto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of the State has promised to review the act again."
Finally, let us note that the temperatures rise with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very closely standing advisor, had explained about CBC that the responsible for this massive leak should be killed.
He referred here to Mike Hokkabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed a plan for renewal of the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries in Cancun in order to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW) which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be achieved in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the specific major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCCWs emitted to earth due to lighting, if the white-glowing bears, which are still a monopole of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better by light diodes (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to a equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global driving park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the large emission emission emission emissions emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that should swallow down the global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gts should be deducted from this balance sheet to stabilise the climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 in order to prevent it from being uncontrolled.
In the white-glowing pears, 95% of the energy differs in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces light.
With the compact fluorescent bears, energy consumption decreases by 75%, with the new LED glue bears, this energy needs is reduced by twice.
The compact fluorescent bears hold in average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED glue bears, such as those that the manufacturer Philips has marketed this week - this society has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and spends 80% less energy than a white-glow bear, which means an indication of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new-style glue bears deliver very little heat, they can also function with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bears have reserves, as they contain mercury and therefore need to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except producers provide an adoption site.
However, the main source of mercury releases on the planet, according to the report, does not represent the compact fluorescent bears, but rather the carbon power plants that exhaust significantly more mercury in order to produce the electricity wasted by the white-glow bears.
In the United States alone, these carbon power plants eject 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report detailedly illustrates the profits each country would gain thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in purchasing electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 carbon power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire expects excitedly the announcement of the elections
UN General Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "independent" publication of the results of the Elfenbeen Coast's Presidential elections directly after its expiry.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent election commission to obtain its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," stressed a press speaker of the UN Chef.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Coast of Côte d'Ivoire to prove their responsibilities and to abstain from any initiative until announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exercised by certain foreign governments, the election commission, which was established on Wednesday at midnight, had expired three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second election round under the Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo warehouse expects the cancellation of "faultful" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the ex-rebels camp of the forces nouvelles (FN) during the putch failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast Chairmanship campaign, confirmed that the United Nations Manöver practiced to protect the voters in the north of the country had scared the president's attendants to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints made by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contradictors are now more of the opinion that the Supreme Court of Justice of the State is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassanne Ouattara, a man of the North, who distracts any connection with the ex-rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the elections as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His alliance parties confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, as he knows he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crown of the association and reconciliation process of a country which had been divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the Côte d'Ivoire politicians that they could be held responsible for them in the event of any excursion.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who took the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), in the sense of the International Labour Agency (IAA), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Statistical Federal Office Insea.
The unemployment rates in the metropolis are 2.631 million.
The data of the second quarter were 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In detail, 3,4 million workers of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were ability to work every two weeks or not or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in unemployment rate of 24.2% in metropol (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The seniors have a slightly increase in unemployment rates of 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percent point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a total.
After a controversy on its calculation procedures, the Statistical Federal Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rates since 2006.
Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced a quota of 9.8% in France on Tuesday for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
To Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Region of Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on the public and deception markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged for the undercutting of social capabilities, disfellowshipping of general goods, holiness, intermediary in corruption, unauthorized bribe and arms possession, so his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself on all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him instead of spreading brain spins."
"It's easy to give him a series of criminal charges, another thing is to prove it," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the department, had valued to give the judge a memorandum to his justification before hearing by his lawyers.
A member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than to keep his deposit that he had to lead.
Concerning the business field of competence or the target of the associated fund, he would never have known, said Simon.
In this affaire, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Ballungsraum Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for defence and complicity, but then under the obligation to stay away under judicial supervision by the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to explain the facts that were sent to him."
"The governing prosecutor took into account not to rob him his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were accused and were released from the prison on Tuesday on Wednesday the night, including two of them under legal supervision, according to Vice-President Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Vice-President of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted by "unauthorised influence and passive bribe".
Two government officials of the Aubagne area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one because of the title "Introduction and disproportionation of general goods by a public service agent", the other because of "intravenousity in discrimination of public funds".
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "health and undercutting of social capabilities".
One of the people who were confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned because of a similar affair of fraudulent acts from public hands affected by Corsica.
The flags suspect his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for suspected fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the disposal branch, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the acts of several open investigation procedures.
From close sources of detection, the investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the deposit and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which relates to waste from the Aubagne area as well as from certain cities of the town's Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde rice: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediate function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Riss, a young French researcher held in Iran for "spionage", held the French public in breath, put the diplomacy into alarm and accentured the worsening of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the United States' diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some backgrounds to this crisis.
It describes how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans that went so far to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchmen did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France, and the American jurisdiction, as a result of trade in materials in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme, seeks to benefit.
Finally, they set the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making them believeful that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the release of Clotilde rice, in a clear light.
In truth, he had not done anything in this respect.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the title "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée's strategic consultant, was accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle Orient with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained her the French method.
They advised the Americans to put everything in place to bring back their own nationals, which would be violently held in Iran.
"Macht noise," they said, "articulated loud and clear and without fail" the words "found human rights", "innocent", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because "Stills do nothing" passs the discussion attempts on insightful ways, the Iranians are "master in exceptional manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that arresting foreigners is a "general Iranian tactic" that is "popularisation for political oppression".
He announces that the release of Clotilde rice from prison (which should be made on August 16, on the day she flies into the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro deposit).
And he lets the Elysée predict further hostages, a phenomenon that will "sharp itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde rice was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still held in Iran.
A information has been made in circulation: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to the United States is demanding by illegal trade with sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
The American message, as many other observers, asks about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow shop?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
On September 4th, François Richier assured that this is not the case with Kathleen Allegrone.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fullly surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebuk.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier also wishes to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "stricter" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée advisor chooses a telephone number, adds again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "at present becoming in the buildings conducted by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the preservation of Clotilde rice in Iran, the Elysée does not make its efforts to make it believed by revelations and by media organized "flight attempts", the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from August 25, 2009 swears up "the media flash of the French authorities".
What is based on so much "thank you" to Mr Assad, the Paris message asks.
"Despite their statements with full praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vacuum idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document will then deal with the reasons that the Elysée has caused to diminish this fiction.
He analyzes the intense communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria".
A 2008 policy launched, which was then "prepared and unreserved by numerous critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role constructing" attempts Paris to "aware of Syria what an engagement can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also aimed at "sawing a seed between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier instructed her: "Of course we don't know whether the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least create confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at Elysée.
In a Communication, he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government is adopted a law called "the ashbreadel", which is to prohibit youths from playing online gambling after midnight by blocking their access, as stated government responsible.
A draft law which calls on the online games operators to refuse access to these games to young people under 16 years after midnight, will be presented to Parliament in December, described representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with living a normal life every day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, responsible ministerial representative of the French Press Agency Agence France Presse with this draft law.
The online gambling will then be available again from 6 a.m. in the morning.
He stated that the manufacturer companies had a year of preparation for the application of the law.
The government is also in the eye to ask the manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit granted for access to these games to young people whose parents ask for it, added to the responsible.
He will also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report about various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also a disputed champion in global online gambling competition.
In November, South Korea, compared to 58 other nations, had achieved four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints the teacher country
On Thursday, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints the world championship leadership countries 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is safe: the 2018 edition of the FIFA king discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be a little exotic; the International Football Association hopes to continue to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the premiere in the African continent in 2010, or its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Qatar, Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the degree of economic and political use of a world championship.
So the shops behind the scenes are threatening to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, who was standing at the beginning of the disclosures with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also have ruined the chances for their own country, football weighing, which only once was allowed to carry out the world championship, namely in 1966.
On Monday, the BBC had given him a new nutritional floor by providing a documentary report that takes three powerful members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and to embarrass the English responsibilities, who had mainly carried out a intense lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government hopes for a new edition of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012 for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to re-evaluate England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less sure, because the Duo Spain Portugal does not lack of drumps with its already completed stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
However, the economic and financial sides of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible repressalia against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal make Russia’s chances, despite its gaps in the file (states, hotels, transport), rise to weighty outsides.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to appeal to the unrecognised expression of the accusations of the English press "a unfair competition in preparing the vote" by the Committee members.
"There's got them with dirt, they're trying to compromise them," weathered Putin.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorites, strengthened by the experience of 1994.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem to be early for two countries who had joined the competition in 2002.
Another threat: the WM 2026 license requested by the FIFA for China, which let the Asian chances fall down to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the upcoming futurist stages, FIFA pursues their expansion towards new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the sensitive nervousness of FIFA under the weaknesses of television rights (as a result of time shifts).
Second mandate: publicity
De Gaulle had really stuck.
Mitterand had made him think he was stupid.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current Head of State will be an ergo candidate in 2012.
But the publicity is not well faced by the side of the mystery, which has the role of the Presidency.
So you have to do it as if the doubts exist.
In one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy insured him to make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would give the perspective of "two mandates" on the elysée afternoon before the UMP parliamentarians, had spread a little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Very missing.
The President only reminded that the Constitutional Change of 2008 limits the number of five-year periods of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential election at the time of such meetings in a humorous sound.
"You have seven and a half years with me, or best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't believe that I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words from yesterday do not make him a candidate more than before, but not less.
If they prompt comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal that Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS admonish earlier than adopted for fighting.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the right voters would prefer a candidature of François Fillon which Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," responded directly and carefully to the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he would find a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin informed.
"He will always believe in becoming able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has found himself with openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of State documents
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of unconventional actions of monetary policy to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt to have no chance to do so, even today, more than tensely, on the European bond markets in order not to cause their worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed yesterday at a press conference the active role taken by the ECB in favour of the solution of European government debt.
She has not waived to say whether she believes that the Central Bank could do more, for example by anchoring her programme of the purchase of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President-in-Office of the ECB, in Brussels in the spring of his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, had not been very speaking about its projects, but satisfied to point out that the programme of purchases of public papers on the secondary market would be "extended" and that we will "see Thursday the way the decisions fail".
Only certainty: The ECB is unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the tax chamber were doubled by the ECB last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscriminations of some traders, it was supposed to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among traders that the anticipation of a continuation of the purchasing course is doubted (see page 29).
The people are not expecting any remarkable change in the course.
If the bond transactions of over three months are already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still create freely on the unlimited reserves of money, over a period of up to three months.
The people today are already insisting that this measure will extend with a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme substantially."
"In other cases, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in a short term," says Michael Schubert, Volkswirt, the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," suggested by Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB was to maintain such a purchase volume of obligations that lived on the market," adds Norbert Brams.
In view of the relevance of the position of European banks exposed to the markets of government debt in the euro area, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must enter the market at any price to the place of the lacking investors and act like this to prevent the rapid enthusiasm of the return paid to the weakest states," a major bond holder testified yesterday.
For if the interest rates are to be applied to the flight, the countries would be more obliged to reduce or stabilise their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes to cover in Italy
After a week's start for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decline of the corner interests to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Economic Minister, the Regional Chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "unrecisable" and had heard him expect an "unforeseen" weekend, which the person immediately demented.
In any case, on Tuesday the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for covering the bankruptcy risk had increased to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council that Spain's discrepance of the German interest rates is 400 base points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed a "severe concern" about the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of inflammation from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In the plain text, it means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, distortive tax inputs that threaten the State to no longer be able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget available for the Senate for the examination is 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9% of GDP) and 3.5% of 2012 (as well as 2.7%).
Therefore, the revolving of a new budget collection that could be used as a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
"Where necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says Economic Inspector Olli Rehn.
At the moment Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have repeated this for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who has been trusted with Italy at the IMF.
"There are no problems at the moment, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) less stabilisation progress is required than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, Head of the OECD.
Stay the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a distrust request from the Chamber of MEPs as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized at the end of March.
So there is a little favourable period ahead for a decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had explicitly highlighted it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think it has been proved on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans are clearly united, willing and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although absolutely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday at the interest rates of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, a normalisation start cannot be mentioned yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, the most effective target of speculants today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which particularly depends on banking systems," says the nationals of the Exane GDP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time is going much slower than the markets".
The European countries, who are aware of both this gap and the dangers it poses, intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected ministers of Finance and, in other words, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
This is also the case with regard to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan, the loss of unconventional measures to reinforce the countries of the euro area in the cross-border of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Funds, Klaus's Executive Director Reglement has already started its Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the Investors in Fernost about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the objective of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first advertising paper expenditure of the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Reuters Agency had instructed the United States to support a possible increase in the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first place, are encouraging to take over structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the savings measures, but to show effects in the future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are at any price preventing the need to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on necessary structural reforms that will bring their confidence back on a lasting basis.
On the other hand, European capital providers discuss the available options to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of public bonds.
Axel Weber, who was travelling through Paris on 24 November, had first produced the idea that if the billions of euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to go back into its own pocket.
The nationals of Barclay's Capital, with regard to the market of European government debt, judge that an extension of EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferential" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This fund exists: the European mechanism of dotted financial stabilisation, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
A council which has all the chances to be carefully examined in the main cities of Europe.
Especially when market conditions are focused.
Snow and glatheis: 24 departements in alarm level Orange
The snow-episodes still raise transport difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of the Bretagne, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm orange due to the threatening risk of snow and glatheis.
The regions of yours, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Viennes have joined the 20 departments already in alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tangulate the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers from 2 to 5 cm are also expected from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the region of Paris.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousine are concerned.
The snowfall is considerably enough to cause traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional streets are blocked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tons, including the transport axes of Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, according to the traffic police who do not suggest using their own vehicle only in emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardie, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to be very careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to strike 25% of their flights from Paris Airport Roissy on Thursday and 10% of Orly's flights due to the expected, strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy in the Ile-de-France is in full, it is calculating billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is intended to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, are recalled.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, the State has proclaimed a capital estimate of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant a part of the financial sum to its two-fold on the markets.
Today, the first bills have eventually come up.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which was reviewed this morning by the National Assembly Financial Commission, contains the measures provided for to make the first part of these funds.
This is two of the measures: the creation of a special tax on the construction and taxation of the offices at the Ile-de France.
Firstly, if you take away Article 15 of the Legislative Draft, you'll go "to the public board Société du Grand Paris".
This is numbered: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
Secondly, the new order of existing corporate taxation is "to modernise it to increase its product and to overcome this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A puzzle.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
From the 4 billion you are far away.
"The tax resources are to be calculated to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation, which the State has charged and the Société du Grand Paris is gradually made for the project," is the explanatory presentation.
At the SGP, this system is not at all anticipated.
"Since the moment in which revenue is booked (the two taxes, that is, R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then create only from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions will still be able to look for for a long time, is in danger of producing a fairly moving, parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rach-dependent hackers and emsic spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On the one hand, it has uncovered itself as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is just a scandal in the sense of shiny holiness, which rules the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act (a x-any nation) that is created by a secret service consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "exceptional" American disclosures about the sexual habits Berlusconis throws nothing beyond what you got to read for months anyway in any x-any journal (except those who own Berlusconi) and the terrifying caricatured profile Gaddafis has been offering cabalt artists for a long time material for their sketch.
The rule under which the secret dossiers may consist only of known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to Esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosen Cruisers) repeats exactly what was written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (not yet, that he did not know where news about the non-existing was found), but because those who devote themselves to the occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faulty, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the chief of the secret service (other he could be anything, for example, editor in Libération), who only considers true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American message had sent to the deceased of the State in Rome, was the same as those who had published the newsweek the week before.
So why was such an abolition made about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one side, they declare what each educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the Heads of Government - can call each other or take a plane to meet themselves at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of some small representation tasks, turned into spyage centres.
Any viewer of detection films knows this very accurately, and it does not happen for shy holiness that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly injures the task of shy holiness and serves to put American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-any hacker can get to the most mysterious secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major struggle against the prestige of the state decree.
In addition, the scandal brings the victims less than the "smart judges" in distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the deep nature of what happened.
Previously, in Orwell's times, all powers could be assembled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has since been perfectly correct, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, every transaction, the visited hotel, the chosen motorway, and so on; the citizens would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if you think about what happens today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a revenger of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and a empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is essentially a mystery free of secret, as it awards the public atmosphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveals that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, it means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation that has been added to such a mighty power?
It is evident that in the future, the States will no longer provide any reserved information online - that would be the same as an outhang on the street necks.
But it is as obvious that it is forgjeven with the current technologies to hope to keep confidential reports secret via telephone.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of State went on in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships and for certain ears only be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I am obliged to imagine the governmental agents, in a secret way moving on uncontrollable march routes, their communications nowhere else than in the mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they received in the shoe set.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed drawers: in principle, the spying attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology progresses as a cancer today, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegrafe had revolutionated communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to explore a film band for tape by being able to leap from back to front and all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
With high speed trains, you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours per plane, including the climb.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
One last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what secrets were made between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: as France beautifully speaks his financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or premature funding) that were realized by the developing countries.
And the gross French splendories have already been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have undertaken to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years away, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all registers to convince its partners about the fact that they are committed to fast-start financing: detailed report on actions of their Member States, press conference, large advents, brochure distribution.
The operation transparency is remarkable and grade estimated for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see it when all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which brings it on the right way to respect their commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional efforts have been made, without having enough to do so for the benefit of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guide value he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a guide for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and 150 million will be given for more than three years in the framework of the "Fast Start".
Other countries have chosen similar guide values, either for year or for conditions at level of public development aid.
In contrast, France believed that the financing of all new projects in 2010 was "new and additional".
Otherwise, there are no guidelines in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In fact, the overall sum of the French support of developing countries can remain stable (or also decline) - France claims to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another, decisive element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed € equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is hardly reliable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is fraudulent to present the euro that is taken as an equivalent to a donated euro... and only the costs of the loan for the capital donor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
However, France has nothing other than the following thoughts: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking up 91.5% loans (EUR 389.8 million) and $8.5% donates) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only EU country that largely uses loans.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) meet their commitments to 100% with donations.
Otherwise, if the major majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understood a similar use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial use.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the Arbitrage) could lead to a double negative effect; once EU-internal (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not get completely deceived...
The chapter of premature funding is only a small question in relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on the climate.
But there could be too much drop in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn his lesson from early financing this first year.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward the discussions on the issue of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed issue): it does not escape the question of "responsibility" or the type of booking of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as advanced in the matters of dispute as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment of Kosciusko-Morizet, which will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of "reliability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international base of confidence which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticide taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, such a study published this Wednesday by the Genération Futures Association (hemal movement for the protection of the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that their results "considering the small number of samples analysed, do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent illustration character of the problematics treated," from July to September, the foods usually bought within four, which were consumed by a approximately ten years old to meals plus a meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as laboratory nasery in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counter balance is degrading: 81 chemical substances, including 42 considered possibly or likely carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually consumed substance are not exceeded in the nearing overall case, this survey is very well taken into account that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to endocrine interference substances or substances is exposed to endocrine disorder factor," the association observes.
Already at breakfast the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three safely demonstrated as carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil as a meal time for the study shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including at lunch, where the study has identified traces of strictly prohibited insect drugs in the EU.
Also, the chunk, the tune, even the baguette and the chewing rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were sprinkled.
The analysis has revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms in the conducting water.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 identified chemical residues was the "richest" and even the plastic counter used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "contaminant cocktail" for consumers is probably underestimated, says the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed, on its part, "in view of the urgent situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
