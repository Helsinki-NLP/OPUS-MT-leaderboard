Walish Members do not want to appear as "muppeters"
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, which is today known under the AM (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
As a result of the plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from the entire political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of Labour's Labour Party explained his group was worried because “The Twp and Pwp are rimed.”
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means "drowsy" and pwp means "besh".
A representative of the Wales Party Plaid Cymru said that the group in its entirety was "dissatisfied" and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was “open” for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word “Muppet”, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British snake word for “dust”.
In this context, the walisic letter W is expressed in a similar way as the letter U is spoken in the English Yorkshire dialec, more like a ‘uh’ sound.
Assembly Commission, who currently develops laws to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, it is the Members themselves who have the last right of destination in respect of the name to be mentioned."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which showed general support to rename the National Assembly to the Walesian Parliament.
As regards the title of the representatives, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parlament Members), but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
Representatives do suggest other alternatives, but to make all parties reach a agreement can lead to the headbreak of President Elin Jones, which, according to the plan, will provide a draft legislative draft for the change of name in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee system.
The representatives have the last voting right on what they should be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to the election to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote in favour of changing the name of their country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decades of dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour represents a requirement in their territory and has on several occasions opposed the country's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum for the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
The support players of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they must pay for participation in the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's styles – the crochets of Harlem are struggling
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on each corner," says Adams.
"Now there is none of the parts."
He said the bars' apostasy was understandable.
He says: "Folk are socially associated with each other in other ways."
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the local environment, which everyone visits regularly.’
As regards the churches, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe, “and sooner or later they are back at the starting point.”
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the kind of people who do not want to help the remaining refugees of the neighborhood.
“The majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore will only speed up the day when these churches have to close the doors forever, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both cracks were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropole — Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had stayed nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boikott of dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem’s principal handmasters — because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 made great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson’s parish children planned for the reconstruction, they bought in a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly declared that the carillon was “the church clocks of the poor people. ”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “an cultural tax” and“ an unreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that was played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's during the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which are introduced by the church's legs and other of the Bishop.
The Church Council — the congregation’s leadership, composed of legs — wrote to the Bishop in July about its concern that the Bishop would “try to force the costs ” of the Church Council, despite the fact that the Church Council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the Bishop.
Some parish children complained about the lack of openness from the Bishop's side.
Hai hurts thirteen-year-old on a hummer diving in California
A shark attacked and hurt a 13 - year - old boy when he ducked for lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy cried out of enthusiasm about catching a hummer, but he realized that the boy eventually shouted 'I was bite!
I was bite!"
His whole bone was ripped up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone should get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water'," said Hammel.
The boy was transported with air ambulance to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical state.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take her in on the British beauty care market.
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Super Drugs and Debenham's with warehouse-like make-up and beauty shelves, crewd by specially trained employees.
The expanded shelves are tested into 11 stores around the country as part of a strong invasion of the UK’s 2.8 million beauty care market, which continues to grow at the same time as the sales numbers of clothes and home articles fall, and if the attempt proves successful, the concept will be expanded to several stores next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket's attempts to find a new use of the place previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home articles.
Sainsbury's said they should double the number of beauty care products they offer to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the store has never sold before.
Existing product selection from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better place in marked marking areas, as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relancing its Boutique sminking brand with principally vegan products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the parfum dealer The Fragrance Shop will test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores. One opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Online trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local daily goods stores means that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Executive Director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales will be more and more similar to a warehouse, as the supermarket takes up the fight against the cheap stores Aldi and Lidl with several services and goods other than food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of stores, and also introduced a number of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The last attempt of the supermarket to upgrade the departments of beauty and pharmaceutical products failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the collaboration was resolved after a dispute about the distribution of income from the pharmacists in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 shop pharmaceuticals to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmaceutical chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan by adding a selection of luxury marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelves to create more inviting environments for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained associates who are ready to provide advice and help.
Our brand committee is designed to satisfy all needs, and the inviting environment and practical locations make us now a beauty competitor representing a new trade experience.”
Peter Jones is "wonderful" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million.
The Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is supposed to be angry after the TV host Holly Willoughby withdrawn from an 11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessories, Truly.
Their company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is programme manager in This Morning, advertised at Instagram that she leaves the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand for the last seconds to focus on his own new golden contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “wonderful” at a tense meeting on Tuesday at his headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, here, the golden girl of television admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – means that she no longer has time for her clothing and accessories, Truly.
The Society has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
At the same time, while Willoughby (37) announced in Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left Britain on the way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's first priority.
It was a long - term investment that would give her financial security in the next decades.
Everyone is totally shocked by her choosing to withdraw.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday – it was just before the launch.
Now a warehouse is filled with goods at Marlow's headquarters, which are now ready for sale."
Experts believe that this Morning program manager, among the most popular stars in Britain, may cost the company millions of pounds due to large investment in products such as pussy and light,mote and cosmetic clothes, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The three-child mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp in the last ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has 40% shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby's going to be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin, hosting the I'm A Celebrity I TV program.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We will not comment on his business affairs."
And then we loved us.
He was aware of the criticism he would receive from the news media for commenting some would consider "little presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give away so much?
Said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
"I have not given away anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a new meeting, after even declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a great dirt on the way to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diploma Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “correspondent response” from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States still has sanctions that aim to maintain pressure.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his choosers.
"We're doing very good with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war against North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his work to improve his relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as stopping rockets, helping to release hostages and to get the remains sent home after U.S. officials.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who try to get into this steppful arena, we would have some 200 people standing right here,” said Trump and pointed to the area right in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia raze a island and kill hundreds of people
In the refrigerator of the Lombok earthquake, foreign ideal organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of Lombox’s residents had lost their homes, no national disaster was declared to be a requirement for international assistance.
“In many cases, they have made it unfortunately clear that they do not ask for international assistance. so it is quite challenging,” explained Sumbung.
Sad children now set together a team to travel to Palu, but is not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Crisis Management Office, said that Indonesian authorities consider the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are to be allowed to contribute to the assistance work.
In view of the constantly exposed earthquake of Indonesia, the country is terriblely poorly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Accommodation for protection against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common vision along other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a warning circuits in Palu, although a warning had been sent out, has likely contributed to the death rates.
Even under the best circumstances, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrading of Indonesia's falling infrastructure a key point in his election campaign and spent a lot of money on the road and railway.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which will be reelected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarist tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have changed to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machits, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late compensation in fight against Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by cutting in 89 minutes in the game at Stanford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before he sent it to the longest corner.
The attempt went high over the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally crossed a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it is possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kantte come and touched the ball once and didn’t think too much about it and just kicked it.”
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a measure for 25 minutes.
The Blues attack player sent a passport with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before he changed direction near the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's course half.
Kovacic delivered a fast survival on the midway.
Then he fired a great breakthrough pass that brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left foot kick by Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group game by the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.

The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard something about contacting.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I will ask everyone in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear something suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught up something on their car camera, to contact them — they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police officer has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found in a property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is on, and the police have said they are working to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but has been told that no one is allowed to go in or out of the building.
He was stupid when he discovered what had happened.
The inhabitants are now told that it will take several hours before they get back in.
A police officer was interrogated and told a man that the entire area is now treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the crime scene.
She repeats "it's so terrible" again and again.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial that has been drawn into the dispute of "rewritten history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
However, the Comwell Society has described Jeremy Crick's publishing as “foolish” and “a attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Westminster Palace was also a goal.
The iconoclasm of the British Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic production of Cromwell is a proof of the 18th century's opinions and is part of the history of a man many believe still deserve to be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps late in the 18th century than today, as Parliament’s defense against pressure from outside – in his time, of course, it was about monarchy.
If this is an absolutely accurate representation, the subject of historical debate is still the subject.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognized figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Killing Gris kills Chinese farmer.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on his southwest China market, according to local news reports.
The man, named only with the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead and covered by blood from a broken pulse ulcer near a benge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005, in the city of Xining, the province of Qinghai, China.
He was probably traveling with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby pig path was open.
He said there was a big wrong with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a judicial medical investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the man.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and maltracted” explained the cousin, mentioned with the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan wasn't his or his cousin's.
While the police collected evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for the death.
Even if this is the source, it is not the first time a pig has been registered to attack people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts and caused the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a pig of 300 kg until the farmer’s wife managed to chase away the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba explained to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to common, but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
"They're just playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You only have to show sufficient respect."
The rest of the orcan Rosa will lead to strong rain in the southwest of the United States.
As reported, the hurricane Rosa is weakened by moving across the colder sea on the north coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring flood rain on her journey through North Mexico and Southwest USA in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a orchestra of category 1 at 05.00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a trap begins to form over the Pacific and moves eastward towards the west coast of the United States, while Rosa approaches the Baja California half- Island on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start pushing tropical moisture northwards to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical moisture and the trap nearing will lead to widespread rain in the southwest of the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm rain will lead to hazardous floods, floating rushs, and fast and possible grounds in the desert.
Diptropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in some areas, especially areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwestern country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly worsened conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is very unwise to move around in the desert to the foot as long as there is a danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause river valleys to become widely showering rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The trap nearby will lead to local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along Southern California.
Total rainfall over 1.3 cm is possible, and this can lead to floating rush and fast, as well as smooth roadways.
This will be the first rainfall of the region.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October can cause some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder but the troops remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the central U.S.A. on Sunday.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Great parts of the Central and Eastern United States will probably get a warm start in October, with degrees high at the twenty from Southern Plains to parts of the northeastern USA.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be about 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that Eastern America is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people looked at Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, so Thursday's grieving witness from Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual abuse that was supposed to have taken place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political fever continued, and broadcasters interrupted their ordinary missions to advertise the big surprise of Friday in the last second when it came to the fact that the Senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to carry out a week - long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate’s Court Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take off her clothes at a youth school party.
In a passionate witness, Kavanaugh insisted that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated average seer number for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeer numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the nielsen usually has problems with measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this number of viewers corresponds to the final game in the American football championship or the Oscar division.
Fox News Channel, whose advocates have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led among the networks, with an average seer number of 5.69 million for the hearing of the holidays, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interests were still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main person of Friday's drama.
The moderate republic's office made a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the elevator to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted and shouted at him.
He stood with a slight look for minutes while he was scolded, while the event was sent directly to CNN.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he is telling our land the truth?"
He heard that “you have power when so many women are powerless.”
Flake pointed out that his office had made an opinion, saying when the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the consultations directly several hours later, when the Court Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination was to be passed to the entire Senate for vote.
But Flake said that he was willing to do this only if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate in the next week, which the democratic minority has encouraged.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with her friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake’s choices had a great impact, since it was clear that the Republicans had not enough voices to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to investigate the accusations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of “political games” around Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opposers of her plan to leave the EU to run 'political gambling' with the future of Britain and to undermine the interests of the nation.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, printed side-by-side with her own on the front of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson has continued its attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "extremely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: The police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the death of the LSU player.
The police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) is arrested and sent for deliberate murder, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sams lost their glasses during the basket roof.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His deposit is set at USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a shot in the head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana Stat Police for their work group for the collection of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for contributions to the investigation that led to arrest.
LSU's athlete leader Joe Allva thanked the local police force for his "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returns per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said that the team is "knust" and "in shock" after Wayd's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ashes over Mexico City
The ash that sprays out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s public bureau for crisis prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ashes in one day.
The stage monitored several cases of bullying and shaking.
Images of social media showed a thin layer of ashes covering front routes on cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysics have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake shaking Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalan separaters before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for Independence had a collision with the police, while thousands of people participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote on relief.
A group of masked separatists retired by the rebellion police and bombed them with eggs and powder painting, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handmeng also broke out later in the day, when the police used batoons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independence demonstrators stood and cried “Never forget, never forgive, ” face to face with Unionist demonstrators who cried “Long Live Spain”.
Fourteen persons were treated for less damages they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension is still high in the freedom - oriented region one year after the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming overwhelming number of freedom, but it was a bad call because the vote was boikotted by most who were opposed to liberation.
According to Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at election stations throughout the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was still kept, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s ability to become independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents cry out of joy in getting a voice, but now we're stuck, ” he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalonian independence have had problems with maintaining pressure this year, since many of their bitterly well - known leaders have traveled in self - imposed exile or are in storage while waiting for their role in arranging the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict was encouraged by politicians on both sides.
“The situation becomes more and more tense,” he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been imprisoned for a trial since late last year, announced that he should be voting in the European Parliament next year.
“To be a candidate for the European election is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and regression from democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall

The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 BST.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the event had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A armburst may also have been fired against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livinston was astonished by Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 fights as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good meeting from Dolly Menga proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt’s side is now like Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's side still hasn't won on the highway in the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, which are eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home fight against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained unconquered through six battles in the division, and Chief Holt has not lost a fight after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances for his stupid guests.
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, when their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after slided in to meet Craig Halkett head past the target.
The host let Rangers play ahead, well knowing that they could make problems for their guests at deathball.
And that was how the decisive goal came to.
Rangers abandoned a free park and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a clear course, and he scored a target from the middle of the box.
During this stage, Rangers had had the ball mostly all the time, but the defense of the home team had proved to be inconsistent and the target guard Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos achieved a nearest score that Kelly had to save.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangerskeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston deathball in a short pass.
Crystals kept coming into the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two penalty requirements – once after Halkett's protest against Glenn Middleton, and once by hand – were ignored.
‘Fenomenal’ from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were all amazing and continue to exceed all expectations on the way up.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got on top again, but Holt is supposed to have a lot of the honor of how he has strengthened the layer after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes up through the whole fight.
On the other hand, Rangers did not have my inspiration to divorce.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they have failed to comply with this standard.
The last part of the battle was laboratories — they only got into the homework half once — and it was a little of a resurrection for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smile and blue sky on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
There has arisen a distinction between matters such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police stated security as the reason why a 25,000 people were not allowed to gather themselves before the mosque, but many followers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurdians — also relied on, criticizing both Erdogan’s politics and the German government’s decision to let him in the country.
The contradictory demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is celebrated as a hero of some German Turks and hated as an autocracy of others.
Deptford collision: Bicycler killed in car collision
A cyclist was killed in a collision like with a personnel car in London.
The collision took place in the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford southeast of the city, around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the bicycler was treated by an ambulance staff, but the man died in the place.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a drive where the driver escaped from the crime site in Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday’s collision.
The Metropolitan Police said that the police are working on identifying the man and notifying the relatives.
Road blocks and bus traffic are in place, and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six cops injured in rebellion.
Six prison officers are injured in an incident at a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Revolutions broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09.30 BST on Sunday, and still on.
Specialist Tornado officers have been loaded to handle the event, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one fly.
The officers were treated for smaller facial damage on the site.
A prison minister said: “Special prison staff have been sent in to handle an ongoing event at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons – the responsible will be transferred to the police and may have to spend even more time behind locks and hits."
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager received hospital treatment after an inmate had attacked.
And last October, the rebellion police was called in to deal with a serious incident where the employees were attacked with biljard bullets.
Orcan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood (may be favourable for dry areas)
It is the source of Arizona that is hit by a tropical lprint, but just what is likely to happen early next week, as the remaining power of Rosa moves through the wilderness areas of the southwest and leads to flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rain will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cycles have maintained the status as tropical storm or lprint within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.”
The last National Hurricane Center models foresee 5-10 cm rainfall, with up to 15 cm somewhere in Mongolon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest desert, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin Mountains, are likely to have between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside the flood, Rosa can be a blessing because the area suffers from dryness.
Even if flooding is a serious problem, some of this downbrows are likely to be favorable, since the Southwest U.S.A. is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, some more than 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme dryness, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the hurricane Rosa meets land at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has the hurricane force Sunday morning, with a maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific and thus loses power.
Thus, it is expected to meet Mexico with tropical storms on Monday night or afternoon.
The rainfall over parts of Mexico can be powerful and lead to great flooding.
‘Total rainfall of 7,5 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm rainfall’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm until it meets Arizona’s border on Tuesday morning as a tropical lprint, which moves further through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“The chief father expected by Rosa or the rest of it is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern desert in the United States, ” according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce deadly floods and floating rushs and rapidly in the desert and earthquakes in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four assaults for murder attempts.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of murder attempts, after a 16-year-old was found knife stuck in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsomer Norton at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday.
He was driven to the hospital, and his condition is supposed to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked everyone who can have mobile records of the event to contact.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has suffered "in the minority and mind" of the democratic party.
"A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the unreasonable and shocking tactics of the democratic party," said Trump in front of a referendum in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered "in the minority and mind" of the democratic party through the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the convention on Thursday, and denied strongly and emotionally the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he committed sexual abuse against her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford is also witnessed about his accusation during the hearing.
On Saturday the president said that “the American people saw how brilliant, skillful and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
“A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most skillful lawyers of our time, with spotless water in public service,” he told a gathering of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred discreetly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of the republics' votes in the interim elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of our lifetime's most important choices.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"This is why I travel around and fight for the best candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats are aimed at “motstanding and preventing”.
The first intermediate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to the assistant of a leader of the Republican Party to CNN.
Hundreds of killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed, and many were dragged to sea by huge waves that thundered against the beaches when a large earthquake and a tsunami met the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach of Palu, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves thundered in land around the sunset, destroyed everything in their way and drove many into the drowning death.
The tsunami came into the heels of a earthquake with strength 7.5.
“When the tsunamifare appeared yesterday, people still run on the beach with activities, did not escape immediately and ended up as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s Crisis Management Office (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“ The tsunami was not alone — it drove cars, trees and houses, it hit everything on land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to flee from the tsunami and survived."
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the crisis management facility showed many corrupted buildings and stores, disturbed and broken bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Afterquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was known by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Eat for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated that the force from the vast earthquakes of Friday was about 200 times more than the force of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s position at the end of a long, narrow bay may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the state.
Nugroho described the damage as “wide ” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels have crashed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found caught in the ruins of collapseed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death rates and damages can be the larger coast of the country 300 km north of Palu, in a area named Donggala, close to the heart of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication "was completely depressed, completely without information" from Donggala.
There are more than 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may become much worse."
On Saturday, the site was strongly criticized for not informing us that a tsunami had met Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had been hit before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording shared in social media, a man at the upper floor of a building is hearing desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching pastors on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water comes thundering to the beach, riping buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a huge power fracture that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
According to the authorities, the military has started sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other needs.
The city's airport is only open for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death rates after the tsunami in Indonesia rise over 800.
It's terrible.
World Vision’s staff from Donggala have come safely to the Palu center, where they have searched for shelter under the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me that they saw hundreds of destroyed houses," he said.
It's terrible.
As helping organizations began the dysting preparations for the provision of emergency aid, some complained that foreign assistants with great expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into a crisis area until it is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provinceal disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'Okay, this is a national disaster' we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet been statused."
When the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquakes and tsunami hopes friends and family of those who are still missing to be among their loved ones of the miraculous stories that light up the dark news of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a rifle.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated by rescue crews after spending two days under ruins with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders of the Asian lekes, which were carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mondayi, were his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional ought to bear," he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the executives who attended the beach festival in Palu.
However, the messages resulted only in grey hake marks, rather than a few blue hake marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.

Friday morning thiefs stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled a mini bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had cleared a mini bank in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who ran up behind the Brink's staff and stole a bag of money to be delivered.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West change his name – to Ye.
When he advertised the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The creation was formerly known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of its eighth album, launched in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the songer Ariana Grande on the program after she cancelled on 'emotional basis', according to the series creator.
Besides being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, discussing the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, all.
The album is more a representation of who we are."
He's one of many known rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously collaborated with West, has also differed between the use of ribbons and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's advertising president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sweared that he will never use military power against civilians by approaching the 50th anniversary of bloody regressions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that “he will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people”.
Military troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on the square of October 2, 1968, and killed as many as 300 people, during a period of left - political student movements rooted across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education leads youths into criminal gangs.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double their amount of research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and artistic intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. Government have made announcements on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its part, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number 1 in the innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough,” said Lee.
Double financial support may double the chance that the next great performance in artificial intelligence comes from the United States,” said Lee in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is director of the Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that hit the US's best Othello player, and later was a leader at Microsoft Research or Director of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee acknowledged the former technology competitions of the U.S. government, as the Defense Advanced Research Projects’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to help find the wise heads of the next generation.
According to Lee, scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to receive State aid.
“It’s not China’s stealing the academic leaders, it’s the companies,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired wise heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in artificial intelligence.
“I believe that those who have a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence should receive a residence permit offer automatically,” he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people through academic institutions,in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Previously this year, the United States Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
With regard to NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. law which aims to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonian votes in the referendum on whether the country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether or not to change its name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia to resolve a decade of dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, who also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour is a requirement for Greek territory, and has laid down veto to include them in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new navel, but nationalist opposers argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the slave majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boikottation campaign has caused doubts about the meeting will meet the 50 percent minimum requirement, which is mandatory for the validity of the vote.
The question of the voting note is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece."
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, a country that occurred after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's protective paraply, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be decisive because a high number of Members have said they will observe the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-third majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission has said that they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 p.m.
Yet, the meeting was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters gave their voice.
“I came to vote because of my children – we belong to Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko votes in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018. The referendum in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors so that they can become members of NATO and the EU.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) made a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by the Boikotte voters.
“We are positive to the NATO and the EU, but we want to be registered with a high head, not let us go,” says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our worth.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of European integration.”
Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead extremely necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our inhabitants want us to be members of the EU and NATO,” says Zaev after voting.
He says a yes reply will be a confirmation of our future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voting rights will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the meeting required.
Another study, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the blacks are planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious political obstacle to the pro-west government since it took over in May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero maneuvering through the entire Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a target for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attack player received an adaptation at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran around with three Brighton defenders before he got out on an open track.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defense before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passport to the left to reach Sterling.
The English attack player used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right shoes to beat Brightons Holder Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero still has some foot problems,” told the city manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
“We talked about that he was going to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a target right then."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League.
This target came for 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attack player sent the ball into the net right before it was over the deadline.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be a spoiler for Rockies.
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs and have no reason to bet strongly.
The always equally competitive Scherzer still hopes to stand on the track on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoffs of the Colorado team, who leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one fight in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card square with a 5-2 victory over the National Friday night, but still wants to secure their first division title.
Even if we don't have anything to win, at least we can play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the second team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of fight I'll be playing this year.
Why would I not want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have still not announced its starting pitchers for Sunday, but it's supposed to be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won this season 18 matches and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trumps People's Assembly in West Virginia
The president referred discreetly to the situation around the Supreme Court, admired Brett Kavanaugh, as he talked about the importance of the republics’ votes in the interim elections.
“All that we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant. That's why I'm travelling around and fighting for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happen right now.
And they are determined to take back power at any price, where you see the tinyness and evilness.
They don't care who they hurt, whoever they have to overrun to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give it to them."
The democratics, he said, are aimed at “motstanding and obstacles.”
"And you see it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "sune and bad and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate’s Court Committee and mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by name, on which the audience bowd highly.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you licked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, no, I expect one — it was a very bad body language — the worst body language I've ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to sensify me, there was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last one in a wide range of Labour parliamentarians who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of antisemitism.
In my case, I was supposed to be sentenced because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding how important it is to have responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – ironically similar matters that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
On the Nottingham East Labour report on Friday, it stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the atmosphere at many of the meetings, and the promise of “smoother, friendlyer” policy is too long forgotten if at least it ever began.
It becomes more and more clear that different opinions are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable to partial leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I had previously thought I shared many political attitudes with suddenly starting to expect I to take an U-swing and stand for the opinions I had never previously agreed on, involving the security of the nation or the internal market of the EU.
When I speak publicly — and I don’t have anything to say what I say — I receive a lot of bad messages on social media that require me to be disposed of, condemns center policy and tells me that I shouldn’t be part of Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
I know I'm more lucky about some of my colleagues, because the comments I usually receive are political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that sexual discrimination and racist comments every day, but never let themselves be cowled.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how severe excretion has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we are no longer such a party that is open to everyone, and every distrust proposal and every change of the rule of election will make the party narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years where I'm being invited to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much because it's going to do everything better.
But that's not why I took part in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had led my classroom in the public school I went on literally collapseed, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local council and as government minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, not even in the past elections.
No one in the Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political attitudes or disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who presented the proposal on Friday, I would just like to say that as the country runs our way towards a Brexit that will harm private persons, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and power on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to communicate is not to Nottingham Momentum – it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats of deliberation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best cares for your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the final result a little bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazing entertainment tent's Premiership Battle.
They're now at the top of the table, and they're the only unset by the ten.
Finally, their superior defense was as much as their ability to use the possibilities that led to the victory of their home team, and trainer Peter Murchie had good reason to be content.
"We have been challenged in our battles so far and are still unconquered, so I have to be pleased," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better to use the possibilities than we were."
Grant Andersons attempt for 14 minutes, with a target park from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the leadership, but a yellow card to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, made Melrose out of the position, and Jason Baggot performed a trial without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty park before he, just before a break, scored and targeted a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the other half strongly, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, with a target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on the bears, and from the restart, Ayr's leadership increased even more oath a trial from Stafford McDowell, with a target park from Climo.
Ayr’s functioning captain, Blain Macpherson, then received yellow card and Melrose exploited having an extra man on the track to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
Yet, the home team came strongly back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to handle Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the deposit behind the advanced Ayr wall.
Climo achieved a target park, as he did almost completely from restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong’s boxing park and sent flanks Gregor Henry off for the fifth family attempts.
Still Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that Still Game Star Ford Kieran is on his way into the servering industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a restaurant company with grants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program for which he writes manus and plays together with his long-term comedie partner, Greg Hemphill.
The Due has announced that the coming nineth season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress would not comment, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow's "living restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a country without coastline, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific.
Sailors patrol a riggined marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings lift a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicaca lake to the Amazon Sea are decorated with the motto: “We have right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
The whole country of Bolivia still has fresh in memory the coastline they lost to Chile during a bloody resource conflict in the 18th century, and the country longs for once again to sail in the Pacific.
These hopes may be larger than they have been for decades, awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1st after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has driving power, community spirit and peace of mind, and of course expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the judgment of the International Court on a large screen in many different parts of the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will give its ruling in favour of Bolivia’s claim that Chile — after decades of trackadic negotiations — is obligated to negotiate Bolivia’s own exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president — faced with a controversial re-election campaign next year — has also devoted much to the decision of Monday.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
However, some analytics believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia’s party, and that very little would change if it had.
The UN body, held in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard, says Paz Zárate, a chilenian expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia’s case, the last four years may actually have made things worse.
“The problem of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration,” said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has destroyed any other goodwill remaining on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it would be extremely difficult to discuss the matter afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the theory that the Court’s decision came unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday Bolivia will give “a extraordinary opportunity to open up a new generation’s relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “stop 139 years of disagreement, in favour of both parties”.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — has used the maritime situation as a political cover.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,” he added.
"The teaching is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never disrupt its nuclear weapons if they can't trust U.S. authorities.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to comply with their promises during a meeting between the two conflicting leaders of Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems ready to start the locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "want dream" to continue penalties and American opposition against is a statement that ever ends the Korean war will force North Korea into the knees.
The U.S. authorities are skeptical to accept the declaration without that Pyongyang first implements significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want another meeting.
But there is widespread doubt about whether Pyongyang really plans to release a arsenal country is likely to view as their only security guarantee.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mote shows in Paris reveal the last in huge headwear that is on the way to a clothing store close to you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne deducted a selection of strange, over-dimensional headwear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the motel leafs on the moteucha in Paris.
Very unpractical hats have been popular at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent down their outstanding creatures.
Valentino’s most spectacular clothing was an excessive beige hat decorated with a featherlike broad brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other superdimensional accessories included jeweled water melons, a troller hat or even ananas, but they are not made to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also deducted a selection of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had rebuilt lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last cry.
One creation reminded of diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cookie.
And if you're looking for even bigger fashion accessories, you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats can be on the way to a clothing store near you.
The superdimensional hats come straight into the heels of La Bomba, with a half-metre - wide brake that has been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractical hat that dominated social media has now sent another great creation down the catwalk — a beach bag in straw that is almost the size of the bathing suit model that wears it.
The orange raffia purse, which is edged with raffia dryers and completed with a white skin handle, was the most outstanding creature in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Moteuka in Paris.
The well - known styleist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the clothing stores next summer – when the designer has had such a great impact it would be difficult to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for the world’s citizens
Scotland's fresh oils continue to show academic superiority, and this has continued in 2018 with more than one year's excellent degree results. These are supported by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other social actions.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
As a educational body that can design and implement a tailored school course, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanded choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands when his head says.
If you speak to him in his own language, his words will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we can stay in English not only when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the graduation results of the year, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages of resistance from fresh oils.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the graduation character A.
The data, collected from the 74 member schools of the Freeschool Council, showed that 72 percent of students received the graduate character A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish, were also given A.
This illustrates that fresh oils in Scotland support foreign languages, which will undoubtedly need a decisive skills for children and young people in the future.
Languages such as vocational choices are now appreciated at the same level as real science, technology, engineering and mathematics on the pensum for fresh oils and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for the reasons of employers' failure to occupy an unemployed job, 17 percent could be attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills become increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalized world.
If you have learned a different language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive progress.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two - digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
That is why investment in language education is now crucial to the children of today.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with growing economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland, if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages that are considered to be most valuable for Britain on the road to 2020, such as Mandarine and Japanese.
No matter what interests your child, there will always be a selection of languages to choose between fresh oils, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scotish fresh oils aim to create a learning environment that will prepare their children and equipped them with the knowledge and ability they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today’s global business environment that languages are constantly decisive for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as ‘international communication capabilities’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity, and outlook for Scotland’s youths.
I'll get the bees fair.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost faced with fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday's pre-season.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After a exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-game pre-season plan.
"I don't need pre-seasonal matches in this stage of my career," he replied.
Time for Trump's people's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President starts a number of election meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five planned national meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his chosen Supreme Court candidate is awaited, Trump is aimed at obtaining support for the coming interim elections, since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when the voters go to the voters in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia people's meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's people's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will start at 7:00 a.m. this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's people's meeting in West Virginia online below via direct streaming at YouTube.
Trump will probably discuss the week's hearings for High Court Board Kavanaugh, which is accused of sexual abuse.
The main objective of all these referendums is to support republics facing a challenged election in November.
President Trump has therefore stated that these five national meetings in the next few weeks are aimed at “firing volunteers and supporters, trying to protect and expand the majority of the representatives in the Senate and the House”, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible while we move towards a busy campaign season”, Reuters heard by a campaign speaker for Trump who did not want to be named.
The night's referendum, which will be held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and covered by the Pittsburgh Press", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate Candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is following the opinions.
“It’s a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to lift his opinions,” said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA shows a fight spirit to keep their faith as they enter Sunday's single game
After three unilateral increases, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what the year's Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum’s swinging pendel is a completely poemed sports concept, but yet what players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led with six points and now there are four, so we're wearing it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the path.
Of course, Europe wants the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 remaining to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have got a little wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent game from tea to green, for example.
The deep crying of celebrations became higher as his round continued, and sink to a decisive putting to raise the match to the equal when he and Thomas were two below two.
His pudding, who won them the match of 15, was met with a similar scream — of the kind that shows that he still does not think the American team is chanceless.
“We really just have to put all the clutches on and focus on our own match,” said Spieth.
That's all these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have gained more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
The unusual but wonderful couples of Europe have four out of four and do not make a foot mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who avoided a bookey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided Bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday’s largest competitors, and no other players will see a European victory as the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everybody prefers both at the same time, in each of their holes.
Still, it is too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily kicked up with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bookey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swedish were so far in deficiency that they did not have the nubbesjans to recover.
But on Sunday there is no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look at close teams because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as teams so far, and lies far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the Team USA has the battle spirit missing some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 10-6 at the beginning of the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advance at the start of Ryder Cup's last day, after Hh completed the Sunday fourball and foursomes matches with 10-6 leadership against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods, and raised its score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who struggles to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's accidental side in the morning's four-balls and won the series 3-1.
The United States made more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but they did not recover any of the foregoing.
Jim Furyk's side has to pick up eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that has received four points in a row, and he and Molinari – together called “Melliwood” after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup’s history.
After crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they cooperated nastyly to beat down Woods and the American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with even more emphasized 5&4.
Woods, who halted through two matches on Saturday, shined in between, but now lost 19 of their 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting for the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and achieved a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brook's Kupka, ranging as number one and three worldly.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light brise southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who have won Major's three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight of 2&1 victory over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, a team has managed to pick up after a four-point pre-slash at the start of the single game, but as present holders only need Furyk's side to get a drawback to keep the trophue.
But after being the second best for two days, they do not seem to be able to deliver a counter attack on Saturday.
North Korea will “in no way” admit to unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust against the United States, and that the country will in no way agree to unilateral release of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization's Annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out “significant welfare measures” during the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, demonstrating the nuclear testing area and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We have nevertheless seen any similar response from the United States,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not under any circumstances unilaterally disarmament ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradually nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his statement was important because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament completely, as Pyongyang has done before.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the 'atom degradation of the Korean peninsula', while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has requested a formal conclusion of the Korean war from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international sanctions against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘atom disarmament first’ and lifts the pressure through penalties to achieve its goal forcefully, and even opposes the ‘Declaration of the End of War’, according to Ri.
“Belief that penalties can force us into our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuing penalties create further distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of another match between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months, and added: “If the other party in this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked as it is.”
The tone for Ri's speech was still very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the mainland U.S.A. with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "rakettman" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to 'complete destruction' of North Korea last year, Trump stood before the United Nations and commended Kim to be courageous enough to take the disarmament steps, but said that much work remains, and the sanctions must remain present until North Korea is nuclearly depressed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a timeframe for this, saying, "It has nothing to say whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures implemented.
However, the United States Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that “the sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained strongly and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased penalties against North Korea since 2006 to kick the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side lines of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but the last trip wasn't good.
He left Pyongyang in July and said they had made progress, but only hours after accused North Korea him of having made "procedural requirements".
North Korea undertaken in a meeting with Moon this month to lay down a missile area and a nuclear plant if the United States did “equivalent measures”.
He said Kim had said that these "comparative measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard Course to Get Suspended
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by dealing with the growing uculture of pumping through the night with coffee imprints as fuel.
A academic found that students at the best university in the world often did not know how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after he gave a lecture about the effect of sleep shortage on learning.
"After the talk, a girl came to me and said, "Why has no one said this before?"
She said nobody had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to the students the importance of good sleep habits in order to be academic and athletic and to the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for the university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw students suffering from serious sleep shortage.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In the one part, there is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, yoghing shoes, and books, and hear about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports performance is affected by sleep shortage and how important it is with a sleep routine.
In other parts, participants learn how long - term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes the participants think about their own daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know about this, as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in pumping all night, he said, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students led to an increasing problem of sleep shortage.
Enough sleep should be the student’s “secret weapons ” against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even as a means of weight gaining, when sleep deficiency puts the brain in famine, leading to constant famine.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course and took one of the classes of the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course available to the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all master students to take a similar study program before they are enrolled at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on a alarm for when to lay as well as for when to get up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disturb the dayryst and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Measure of Menga kills Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered probably a loss when Dolly Mengas target hit Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss of 18 matches as manager and left behind since his eight points from Ladbrokes Primeirship leaders Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to compensate.
Rangers now fall to the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind Hibernian on target difference.
There may be more trouble in the ghost for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after a object was thrown out of the remote public.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on the team, which swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup Semefinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been pleased to see how his well - trained team hit the opposers.
Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more about it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the fight when Mengas first passport sent Scott Pittman through at Allan McGregor's target, but the middle player was losing the chance.
A long free park of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target bar.
Rangers took control, but it looked like their game lent more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty park after 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers only managed two shots at targets for the first time, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly didn't get any problems with Lassana Coulibalys head and a stupid kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opened for 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it too hard.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his head cold when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to get away players to play exactly the kind of fight they like, as Lithgow and Halkett caught up a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the leadership in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacobs before Lithgow's head from the corner.
The Rangers investor Glenn Middleton probably had a late claim for a penalty park when he got in conflict with Jacobs, but once again Thomson went away.
Almanak: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the “Sunday Morning” almanak: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device we know today as the geiger counter.
The Geigerteller has been an important part of science since then, and also became a part of the popular culture through the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: “It's a geiger counter, it finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you take on these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals is released.”
Evans: "Should it make noise now!"
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention he gave name to live on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine learns the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory
Cells can reach a protein common in many cancers and then be injected again in the patient
A test vaccine has had promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, who learns to recognize cancer cells, experienced that her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, typically for many cancers, and then reinject these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives growth of different types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, which took immune cells from the patient and “instructed” to address cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, brought a strong defense of Trump after the SNL action.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was builded in a studio on Saturday Night Live after a familiar act where he praised American President Donald Trump and said he would make elections in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again-hat, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I speak to a white person, and then the person says, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was afraid of racism, I would have moved from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made ridiculous of Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though it was not broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded into social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West by laying out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had heard it in the back room about the choice of headaches.
"They mobbed me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They mobbed me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see that I understand the reality?" he said, "Will he take on me the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do."
Try love."
His comments were bowled at least twice, and the employees working at SNL looked ashamed, Variety, where a staff member said: “The whole studio became deadly.”
West was brought in as the last little substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song “I Love It” dressed as a Perrier-water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our courageousest: Thank you for putting in the mice.”
But talkshowvert Karen Hunter twittered that West is just "who he is and it's totally amazing".
“But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art” that I mean to cultivate and spy out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the raper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, and he said that from now on he was "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The raper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion, and then, of course, it's dead musical legends Prince, who changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington's outwards against "reliable masculinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role of the swordswinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent imagination series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31 - year - old actress has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and often says such roles on movies make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has gone wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic maskulinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he was very interested in the theme.
“I’m quite worried about it at the moment – where was it going wrong with masculinity? ” he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit believes that TV may have parts of the blame for the increase in "toxic maskulinity" due to the strong maskulin roles.
He continued: "What is inborn and what is given?
What is distributed on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate this aspect of being a man?
I think that is one of the really big questions today — how can we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any predecessor or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and he says he is “completed with battlefields and horses.”
From November Kit will play the main role in a new recording of Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife during the recordings, so there came something good out of it – my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kit's role figure Jon Snow is in love with in the Emmy prize-rewarded fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of a total of 14% in the number of inhabitants living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, says the health representative.
About 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The large majority of new cases have been transferred through sex, which indicates a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain parts of China through blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV in this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health staff at a conference in Yuntan Province.
Year by year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is said to be high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually marrying women.
Many of the disease infections are caused by inadequate protection by sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of an action to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the collaboration of leaked data on republic senators, flashes of “hazardous liars” and “conspiracy theories”
Member of the representatives' house, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday charges that members of her staff had placed the personal information to three republic senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles assured by the claims was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
“Liars, liars and more absurd lies,” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information was reported to include the home addresses and phone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill under a panel hearing at the Senate on the charges of assault against Brett Kavanaugh.
The lecture came a little after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the article was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
“This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie” continued Waters.
“The members of my staff - who have received their identitys, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false accusations – had absolutely no responsibility for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and a regular lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive," wrote Fleischer.
“This suggests that she has not the right temper for being a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
You can't defend them.
Don't doubt the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and understand."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being aggressive during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intermediaries, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
"Short – if it's true," he twittered.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned “relevant authorities and police about these false accusations.”
“We will ensure that the actors are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff.”
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – Blood poor Rowan Atkinson in spy parodi
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit suggestions in all new movies with a British snapshot and it seems to be present for this resurrection of Johnny English action comedie, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic self - satisfying about how obviously hopeless we have become the nation’s new export product?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his blowing eyes and the rubber view has made his license renewed to rot it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure designed in territories with non-English-speaking kinopublikum.
Of course, he is the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a doughnut Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one note in the music record with fire wagon theme during the opening ceremony at the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the longest forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's some great moment in the last Johnny English ride.
I loved how Johnny English approached a medieval armour helicopter and the rotor leaves sneaked his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent of physical comedie comes to his right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely excessive, especially now that the “serious” brands that are 007 and Mission Impossible have willingly away features of comedie.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and spitting as the damn film lies of Mr. Bean.
The current prerequisite is that Britain is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltred Britain's super-secret web network of spys and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guardian agent – an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a Prime Minister, a pumpous and depressed figure that already undergos a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this like-Teresa-May role, but the manuscript does not give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform that since each active spy has been revealed, she has to pick up some of the retired.
And that means the clowned Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobbed etablissement, but gives inofficial education in secret intelligence, there are some gentle sequences here when English offers a rocka academy for spy activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a fast orientation and reunited with his old, plagued helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, chopped with a submarine commander, a hysterical superclass women's role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin style of rotting everything to on the Queen's mission are back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is deceived by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the lumish Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with farcelike sides: clothed as servings, they fire a splendid French restaurant; they create chaos while they hide on board in Voltas luxury yacht; and English tries to use a VR headset to make known in Volta’s house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but even so loving and noisy it's so much like kid TV with the whole thing.
It's quite medium-sized, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't just think, "Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets to use his talent?
Labour denies that they have planned to let the British work for four days, but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will evaluate a radical plan that will give the British a four-day working week – but pay for five.
The party seems to want business leaders to use savings on the revolution with artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra weekly release.
This will result in a three - day celebration of employees, while they receive the same wage.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party’s economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day week so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party reported The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition that corresponds to the party’s desire to allow the pencil to turn to the benefit of the workers – in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day week during the campaign before the Parliamentary election in 2017.
However, the idea is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesman of Labour said, "A four-day week is not the party's policy, and is nothing that is considered by the party."
The Labour State Minister for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power from "unspecified directors" and "profits" of public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also means that current actors in water companies are in danger of not getting the whole share item back because a Labour government can do “deduct” on the basis of misunderstanding injustice.
He also confirmed the plans of placing workers in the corporate governance and setting up an employee fund to transfer 10 % of the own resources to companies in the private sector to employees, which may receive an annual profit of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI scanning of Kavanaugh can make them change their mind.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has issued a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least one week and raises the question of the Agency's findings may cause some republic senators to change their views.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the accusations came out and asked, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, clear, clear.
However, Graham’s voice seems to be cut in stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it has to be a spectacular finding,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it powerfully," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And none of those she mentioned could not confirm that.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to fighting poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosted to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive assignment; eradicate the world’s poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to flow to the great plenary of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase consciousness about the real goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group hoping to fight poverty by making more people work actively against poverty.
In order to receive free tickets for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the participants had to perform a number of tasks, or “actions”, such as voluntary work, send emails to a world leader, take a telephone or other meaningful ways to increase the consciousness of their goals of eliminating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when only 12 years are left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to make people fight for changes, or just another case of so - called “clickivism ” - that people feel that they contribute greatly by signing a signature campaign on the Internet or sending a tweet?
The Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have registered more than 19 million “actions ” from the followers, with a range of different goals.
They say that these actions have helped world leaders to declare obligations and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could point to 390 commitments and announcements due to their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main entities are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and founders based in the United Kingdom to “help children exploit their full potential” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 twots from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national authorities and the Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice with malnutrition a footnote in history”, said Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in Britain to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, “What makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult way — sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the important civil rights and the anti-aparteide movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe is some of the artists who act at the year's event in New York, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy sports - the Inner Industry Minister
Washington can, if necessary, take action to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealing the United States' Innenrigs Minister, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when it operates on the invitation from the legal government – is a suggestion to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
“The United States has the opportunity through the Navy to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary blocks to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organization profiled as the "Energy Consumers' voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington’s ways of dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are far on the road equal.
“The economic option to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said and referred to Russia as “one trick pony” with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements came after the Trump administration was on a round trip to strengthen exports of its floating natural gas to Europe; they want to replace Russia, the most cheap alternative for European consumers.
Colleagues of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, were therefore trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European Gas Line 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘catch’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the Northern European gas pipeline is worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas management capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is just motivated for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Minister for Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The position of the United States has met opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its responsibilities in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have major problems with third countries that intervene in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the BDI after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to think seriously about his president's candidate for 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “contemplate seriously” whether she would stand as a president candidate after the intermediate elections.
During a election meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wants to stop.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix the shaking government, and it includes a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'd like to think seriously about whether I'm going to stand as a president's candidate."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the election meeting and said that he was "having the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried until the margin of what Donald Trump's doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court Attendant Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI review before the vote."
However, a review published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should be standing in 2020.
58% of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stop, according to a opinion measurement by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The measurement showed higher support to former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% were against it.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed in the context of a possible candidateship in 2020 are among others Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he wanted to decide officially by January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to Track Palins PTSD during Trumps election meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being in sept.
He was arrested and sentenced for a home violence event Monday night.
“What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I have shared with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability of our soldiers, ” she told the audience at a choosing arrangement for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said about the son and other war veterans:“They come home a little changed, they come home the herd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect of what their soldiers and pilots and all other military members have contributed to the country. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and sent for violence at home for a woman, crushed with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policies
The eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States that refuses asylum to victims fleeing from gang or home violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and D.C. submitted an information from amicus curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged policy, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the prosecutor in Grace v. the Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August against the Federal Police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner “and his violent gangster’s sons” abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, producing a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have vigorous problems with gangs and home violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the anchor court of immigrants who allowed undocumented immigrants who fled from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Advocate General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy "sees away from many decades of state, federal and international law".
“The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle”, said the orientation of Amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refuses access to immigrants injures the US economy and says that there is a great chance that they will become founders and "contribute with necessary labour".
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political view,” said Sessions in the announcement of 11 June on policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems — even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operation in Palu – the death rates are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse.
“ It was very excited, ” says the 35 - year - old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever - sick son at an evacuation center in the most accommodated town of Palu.
"They see ambulances that are getting dead all the time.
Pure water is inadequate.”
It was possible to see people coming to ruined homes and lighting through water - damaged possessions in an attempt to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, which were injured in the earthquake with strength 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, sit outside Palus ’ military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe scarcovers.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recalls how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We had no time to save ourselves in security.
I was caught up by the wall that crashed, I think," said Haris to Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘trakassing’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper driving a four - page ad in an American newspaper that painted the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Peking of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to enter the Des Moines Register — the most selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections on November 6, a charge China rejects.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the elections in the United States marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, according to Reuters, U.S. officials.
Although it is normal that foreign authorities use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in a escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new customs rates on each other’s imports.
China's penalty duty early in the trade war was to affect export companies in countries such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, reports Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China, and former many - year governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader post in the Sunday Des Moines Register: "China now steps up the harassment by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press we enjoy in America to insert a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“As a contrast – at the newspaper on the street here in Beijing, you don’t find many different opinions and do not experience real reflections among common Chinese people around China’s problematic economic course, given that the media are under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not inform which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare female choosers away before the inter-election with Kavanaugh, warns analytics.
Since many of the top politicians of the Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual abuse, analytics warn that they will receive a reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings about this have been very strong, and most republics have already given signs of their desire to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn, ” said Grant Reeher, a professor of state science at Syracuse Universitys Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) suggests a FBI investigation for the last second will be enough to reassure angry chooser.
"Women will not forget the events of yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker of the progressive MoveOn Group last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C.
Friday morning, demonstrators sang “November is coming!” while they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s witness statement, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will explode,” declared Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analytist, to the news page.
“The people say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among female uncertain choosers in the suburbs and younger choosers between 18 and 29 years of age, which often do not vote even if they dislike the president.”
Even before Ford’s public evidence, which described the accusations of sexual abuse of the High Court candidate, analytics thought that if the Republican forced through the appointment, it would be a reaction.
“This has become a happy root for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
“It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final approval or Kavanaugh being imposed – it is also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated it”, pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of the Priorities of the United States, a group promoting the election of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the refrigerators of Fords and Kavanaugh’s witnesses, with a small majority in favour of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents were completely or quite convinced of Ford’s evidence, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh’s production.
In addition, 38% said that they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under their testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's playout, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford, plus at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate’s Justice Committee during the oath last week that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, committed her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her while at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the author of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology doctor, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data should be stored and which persons have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the purpose is “the dominance of the world”.
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store online" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, worklists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal data store online is that it is up to the user who should have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorization through data’.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, that the company should make available with resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company consists at the moment of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some initial developers on contract to work with the project and a bunch of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google that they should introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely calculated overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In an article published on Saturday on Media, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to protecting the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic in view of the next epoch of the web”, added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Celebration of Victoria Cross Recipients from World War 1st
The only priest of the English Church assigned a Victoria Corses as a fighter during World War 1 was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Colonel and priest Bernard Water were given honor on September 29, 1918 at the battle in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he was assigned the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Water, said that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather’s prize - gaining production.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Water bataljon led his head over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29 – “through very thick thickness and under strong protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he crashed against the shooting line and led the line “with great courage ” forward before he stormed a field cannon self - handed and kicked out three of the departments.
Colonel Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just a month before war was over.
Michael Water, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble. ”
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid down a crane after the parade, led by the body of Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Water said, “he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, ” adding:“The courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people. ”
MMA attendants were up all night to see the fightsport program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa pigs.
Imagine you've stayed awake all night to see the depth-packed Bellator 206, just to discover that you can't see the main fight.
The attendee of San Jose managed 13 matches, including six on the main card, and was displayed directly through the night of Britain at Channel 5.
At 6: 00 p.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the viewers in Britain were sitting down when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pigs.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to see the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the transition to the child program as “a kind of sick joke. ”
“It is state regulation that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 p.m. so that they have to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communication, as he was asked for the mission.
“Peppa pig, yes!”
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work on the mission plan to include the viewers of Great Brittannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the reconciliation," said Coker.
“But there’s six o’clock on Sunday, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday’s time.
But we're working on the matter.
Faith with -- when we put over, many messages went forward and back, and they weren't exactly of the kind sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But that wasn't what it was, it was an authority thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five fights — as we usually send — and we tried to stretch far for the followers, but tipped over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality
The Olympic stuper Tom Daley says he grew up with a minority feeling toward everyone because of his sexuality — but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until at the youth school he realized that "he wasn't like others."
In the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was standing up for the rights of the homofiles to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The ordinary program leader of the traditional program, Kirsty Young, must be gone for a few months because of disease.
Daley was a little disappearing from the first shipment of Laverne and said he felt "less worth" than any other person he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have the power and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze winner in the OL and has become a highly profiled LGBT ambassador, and he used his participation in the Australian Common-Government lecture to appeal to the decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he appears because he feels lucky to live openly without negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times the world champion said that his in love with a man - film creator Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013, “was surprised me. ”
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in so young age" - he participated in his first Olympic when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was hard to find someone in the same age who had experienced similar up- and downturns.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his “all perspective” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about just having to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold medals in the OL.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they had taken tickets to London in 2012 — since he wanted to sit first.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
“I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not inconquerable,” he said.
The following year Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life – to jump in front of a home public under the OL, the best feeling ever,” he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Proud of Heather Small – which meant much for him in the drive before the OL and still gives him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs goes to BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Form weak Mickelson took out for the golf tournament Ryder Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he's playing his 47. Ryder Cup game, but he's got to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12 times, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and four-some matches.
Instead of being in the center of events, as he had so often been for the United States, it five times the major winner shares the day between being a heavily leader and working with his game on the rank in the hope of correcting what cracks.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even at the top of the career and is not in the perfect form of the tight Le Golf National Railway, where the long rough area constantly punishes lost battles.
And if the path itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, the very British Open-Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fights this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson’s game may prove to be absolutely crucial.
Fear expresses trust in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Furyk.
“He has great confidence.
He is a "Hall of Famer" and has brought so much to these laws earlier, and this week.
I don't think he was gonna play two games.
I saw more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never completely reached up to his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven equals, but Furyk said his participation brought some immateral values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, and likes to go with others, he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He's giving much more than just the game."
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership will soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, European team captain, knows of experience that a significant leadership at the entrance of the last day’s single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into a unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 Battle at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point leadership over the Americans, but the hired victory at least possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only if,” said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and last night leader 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else in that team that this isn't over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get the scores on the tablet.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Bjørn is greatly satisfied with how his players managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t do better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, individual performances are in the center, and there is something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performances as a golf player are tested to the full.
It is the message you need to communicate to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also needs to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players make better individual than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the big revolts last day, and he was in the victory team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe performed “the miracle at Medinah”.
I remember every damn word of it,” he said as a answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had devastated with his players at the entrance of the last day.
“We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you would like to have a good start, such as the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a huge pressure on the middle fights.
Then we arrange our arrangements and send out the people in the way we feel for, you know, we're trying to create something magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the player order.
"I bet this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warships delayed again
The latest fregat of the German Navy would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the Cold War, but this will not happen until the early next year due to failure systems and galloping costs, reported local media.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the leadership of the totally new fregattes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been exposed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, quoting a military speaker.
The ship would have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007 will replace the old fregattes of the Bremen class.
They are agreed to be equipped with a strong cannon, a number of anti-air shoots and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important qualities include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to use the latest fregates for up to two years away from the home port.
However, slow delays mean that the advanced warships — they were told to give Germany strength on the sea — will already be expired before they are put in service, reports Die Zeit.
The destiny F125 freight created headlines last year, when German marine officially refused to drive the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss, Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of return, but German media mentioned a number of important "software and hardware defects" that made the warship unusable in a battle mission.
The software defects were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older fregates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge overweight, which reduces the performance and limits the marine’s opportunities for upgrading in the future.
The 7000-tonn heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class as were used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the whole project — including the training of the crew — has become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached thrilling €3.1 billion – from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the new fregats are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s marine forces are shrinking.
Previously this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Head of the Defence Committee of the German Government, confirmed that the Navy is actually “awaiting the vessels of use.”
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships had been arranged, but no new vessels came.
He's sorry that none of the Fregattes of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust Thieve Listens on the secret lives of the flager mice
New research carried out by a landown in the Scotland will reveal how flager mice use the landscape in hunting for food.
There is hope that finders will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future preservation measures.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common flager mice and dwarf flager mice as well as brownlace and water flager mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flager mice activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flager micerops and the species that do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of the habitat that are most important to the flager mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be taken, such as planting crops and the best care for the forest for flager mice and other associated species.
The flager mice population in Scotland and Britain has fallen considerably through the past century.
They are threatened by construction and construction work that affects jungle places and the restriction of habitats.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, the same with flue paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as hue tax attacks.
In fact, flagermus isn't blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they need their ears more than their eyes to catch prey.
They use advanced ecolocation to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flager mice very seriously.
They have ten skillful experts who regularly carry out studies, maps of jungle places, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only own flagmus reserve at Threave landownership in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland’s ten flagermus species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a perfect area for bats," he says.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and by other property will help us to understand more about what they need to enjoy."
He emphasizes the importance of maping the flager mice before the maintenance of a property since unconscious destruction of one single jungle place can kill up to 400 females and young ones, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
Flager mice are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb them, or destroy their jungle places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish colleague of Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the audience to help in the work.
She says: “We still have much to learn about our flager mice, and for many species we simply don’t know how the populations are doing. ”
Ronaldo rejects the charges of rape while lawyers are going to prosecute German magazines.
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the accusations of rape against himself as "false news" and says that people "want to be famous" by using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The attack player for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's accused of paying her $375,000 afterwards for keeping close to the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video at Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after reporting the charges, 33 - year - old Ronaldo rejected the accusations as “false news. ”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times the Goldball wins into the camera.
"They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want to be famous by giving up my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good," the football player adds with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel because of the claims, which they have called “a unacceptable manufacturing of suspects in the private sphere,” according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for “remember damage to a extent corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal protection in recent years. ”
The claimed event must have occurred in June 2009 at a suite in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the football player’s room, where he is supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents presented to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the claimed event and told her that he was “99% a good person” who was betrayed by the “one percent”.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in hospitals, but later they made reconciliations outside the court because she was “life - feared of revenge ” and also worried about“ becoming publicly dependent. ”
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to abandon the reconciliation because she's still traumatized after the supposed event.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed abuse, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain “will mourn forever” for losing car manufacturers
Britain 'will mourn forever' if they lose the status of world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota had told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an appointment," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border passing at a possible Brexit without agreement could mean less jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As Britain leaves the European Union at the end of March, I think that production at our factory stops,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Executive Director at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they'll close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what the car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks of any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated on the basis of “order by need” and it is arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, as industry says, can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day's storage at Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus the production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa Mays Brexit plan for further connection with the EU is “presistly designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
“We need an agreement. We want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not only enjoy success at the moment but that we take this opportunity,” he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The budget, not only from Toyota but also other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful sight of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned that increasing costs in the long term would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade unions leader at the factory, said that members are increasingly worried: “My experience says that when these jobs disappear, they will never return. ”
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be exposed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's destiny meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein may be "exposed for another week" while the fight around Brett Kavanaugh continued, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has the supervision of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who examines Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to legal exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Deputy Minister of Justice or not, and thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been investigated in Washington's speculation for months.
Previously this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of discussing the conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th constitutional extension.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was on the way to a volunteer.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations, New York, would take place Thursday.
Trump said that he “will mostly let go of ” kicking Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoiding conflicting with Senate’s Justice Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both the Witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a FBI investigation of one week on charges against Kavanaugh, which further put a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date of the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's postponement because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will dispute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
The program host Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the rejection of the "self-goodness" of TV-reporters, even though she added, "I don't disagree with their self-goodness."
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
"The President is making more questionnaires than any former presidents," she said and added without proof: "We've looked at the numbers."
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but “if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it often, and you've seen that we've done it frequently in the last few weeks, and it's gonna replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or is participating in open events or press conferences on visits of important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause when he took a solar race and sometimes had a strange behavior before a multitude of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and a desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a Scottish Member of Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain would leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the costs of application for residence and employment permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Debates between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue have been made through the summer and are expected to land on a solution for the harvest.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I understand this must be a very difficult time for you all.
I would therefore repeat how much I appreciate the efforts of each coworker, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and competence that strengthen and improve the work of health services to the benefit of patients and local communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we hope that you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing urgent surgery after head damage
Defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had an urgent operation after having suffered a head injury during the Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the newspaper Tennessean.
Tennessee States' chief trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sideline and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before they placed him on a bear and took him back for further investigation.
A functionary from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘no information is available on the type/range of the injury yet’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transition from Illinois.
He had five tags on Saturday before he ended the fight, giving a total of 18 tags for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying a property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying property in Britain.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young choosers.
The increase in document tax will be incurred by those who do not pay tax in the UK
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will be charged with a higher document fee when buying property in Britain — and the extra money will be used to help homeless ones.
The action will be considered to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract youth choosers with a promise to offer more reasonable housing and to face high income groups.
The appropriations will be imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's actions to remedy the situation of homeless people.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the current documentary fee, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on housing number two and housing purchases for rent – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to spend up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built property in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “spook cities ” because of the many foreign buyers mostly staying outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson made suggestions for reducing the documentary fee to help more young people own their own home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and demanded that Theresa May reject quotas on reasonable housing to solve Britain’s “shameful housing policy”.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a spectacular range of proposed housing reforms, including rental checks and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give municipal governments greater power to build new homes.
May said: “I said last year that I would take up my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream — that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign - based companies, to buy housing as it is too hard to work British citizens.
Too many people the dream of owning their own dwelling has become far too far, and the unworthy situation for the homeless persevere."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager before or later.
The 42 - year - old Scottish enjoys the challenge of reliving the club in the northeast, which currently holds the third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“ But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there is always something that draws me back.
However, that option would only come if I succeed in the club leadership."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he wasn't worried about following such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured if I can get the club back in the Premier League."
From the structure and facilities of this club they no doubt belong to the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'm probably just going to think I've succeeded here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the management for three years, after a period of assisting boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month short event in Hearts' Trainer Stack.
Then he helped Alloa to resurrect himself from decline to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of decline to win the master title of the subsequent season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the play career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a proper distinction," he recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“ I really thought that leadership was the right thing for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did well, created a reasonable income of it, and experienced some fine highlights.
But football play can be hard.
There are many things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I go through it in terms of stress and pressure in the job, but the leadership feels quite right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, it feels as the most comfortable thing I've known throughout my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-liter is 17.30 on Saturdays, study shows
The summer’s heat wave has strengthened the income of British hard - pressed pubs, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Puberts and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2.7% in July – while restaurant income fell 4.8%, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a corporate advisor of CGA, summarised the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a similar pattern as last month June, when the pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were affected even harder.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurant turnover in June was only worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the very best result, but an increase that was stronger equal to the restaurants went down.
Food - served pubs were also difficult with the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for the racing drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, the turnover increased by 6.6% that month, with food servering decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman, analytics from the RSM hotel and restaurant, said: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and large sports and social events are still the main factors in marketing in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulties, and a turnover fall of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will give a long-term breathing space.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the braking of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry marketing controller for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows research
A study of 20 000 youth school students revealed pages with “fair Insta”.
The news has increased concerns about sharing sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" that they show to their parents.
One in five children — some are only 11 years old — sets up social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 youth students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to image sharing pages at Instagram.
The news has increased concerns about sharing sexual content.
20% of the students said they had an innocent "main account" to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came over the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me. ”
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Private Schools Conference (HMC) revealed that 40% of the 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan said, "It is frightening that so many youths are tempted to set up sites where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "vote of free sports practicers" in Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to govern Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for the leaders of sports to get insight into her extensive experiences in the international nviå over the last ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British, and world-wide freedom environment, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said, “I’m excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have much to contribute to guide sports in Scotland. ”
The American won 200 and 400 meters under the OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic Gold, now firm BBC expert, and after a temporary ice-chemical attack, she couldn't go.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that only time will show whether I want to be restored and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am well back and have learned to go again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!»
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company has divided the opinion on the Internet with an advertising that compares breast - breast - feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump that is carried close to the body”, Elvie, the technology-based company for consumer products, released a healthy and flirting, musical video-inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cage full of high and cows to a song, including the following text: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can see no tail" and "If you don't understand it, this is not jury, it is my tits."
The choir continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the “grassomes ” in the mauribrans.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and food to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after their birth," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump gets fine place in a breast-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Publicly traumatic for both mother and baby.
But – hello, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: "For a failure ad."
Others defend the ad, and a woman admitted that the song is "unbelievably funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," it was one who wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny advertising to mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like “cues. ”
This is not a advertising that hylls or judges the maize.”
At the end of the video the women reveal that they've all danced with the discreet pump in the bh.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes, and gets fine place in a breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provoking launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put an eyelight on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in a entertaining and recognizing way showing the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret.
The number of arrested migrant children has gone through although the monthly border crossing has remained relatively stable, partly because hard rhetoric and politics introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by making claims to a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential support players and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, a superior official of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed for the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who sought to be a support player for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no former criminal record.
‘Nearly 80% of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep persecuting these people," says Albence.
Police officers are trying to handle their children faster and introduce new rules that indicate that some of them must meet in court within one month of arrest, and not 60 days of the previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be presented through a video conference instead of meeting personally to lead their case of residence for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in care, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to reception workers and reports produced in the last few months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who are more struggling are easily ignored because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can strengthen traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks U.S., French, and Turkish ‘Occupational Powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech in the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the war of the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the Minister of Vice - State, said that the foreign forces remained illegally on Syrian ground under the ceiling of combating terrorism and “will be treated afterwards.”
He said to the assembly: "They must withdraw immediately and without condition."
Moualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people are on refuge.
He said that Damascus will continue to “keep this sacred struggle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories” for both terrorist groups and “all foreign presence”.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-devastated country.
As for refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused “some western countries ” of“ sprinkling irrational escape ” that makes refugees stay away.
“We have addressed the international society and humanitarian organisations to organise these returns,” he said.
They police what is really a pure humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey establishing a buffer zone in the last major defence position of the rebells at Idlib has created an opportunity to press on for political conversations.
The Russian/Turkish agreement prevented a large scale attack of Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including warriors of Al-Qaida-associated Nusra Front, who “will be destroyed”.
The UN mission Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to invite the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and oppositional members to develop a post-war basis for Syria and to rail the road for new elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘transmission of the articles of the present Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-elections in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope to, rich court and scandals would put an end to presidentship before that time.
In what would undoubtedly become “the most dramatic conclusion of a presidentship ever!”
At the moment there is no sign of searight.
Since 2014, the viewer's best time has doubled more than 1.05 million in CNN and almost threefolded to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, up to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. The Rachel Maddow Show has toped the cable cable cables with a total of 3.5 million viewers at evenings with great news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because we don’t understand anything,” said Neal Baer, program leader of the ABC drama “Designed Survivor” on a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedy creator and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club”, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to vote on Trump.
She asked why.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, actions in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Issue is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you stretch far to be an illuminated person when you sit down for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dyp thickness in background material" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with struts feather worth $15,000 ('a clothe covered with hybris,' said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' colorful descriptions of Trumps, uh ..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way anymore.
“One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of “Pawn Stars” about Trump’s varied role crew and daily turn on the plot (fighting with NFL, shamross Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode or you'll be hanging after.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he buried himself in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't rip himself off, not when Brett Kavanaugh is going to meet the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States is at stake.
“I remember when we put all the crazy programs in ancient times and people said this was the end of Western civilization,” said Fleiss.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most common choices of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district experiences a stream of money after a relocation of a conventional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting about the same seat.
This newly entranced suburb district in Pittsburg stands with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb stands against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the 12th district of ancient Pennsylvania, who overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was rearranged after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the ancient districts were a constitutional manipulation of the election circuits in the favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race of campaign financing between the largest party funding groups, DCCC (Democracy Campaign Congressional Committee) and NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a button of victory in a closely followed supplementary option for Pennsylvania’s 18th district to the Congress last March.
That seat had been loved by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the territory with 20 points.
Political experts have given the democrats a small leadership.
The United States assessed penalties against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the leadership team to the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the American diplomates from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, ” said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, who received estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials suspended a top - level conference focusing on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year considered as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid - September, however, officials of the top government made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, which stopped all the plans for penalties against El Salvador.
Visitary president Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak to the conference, which is now planned in the middle of October, to show the importance of the administration adds the collection, said the diplomat.
And the three U.S. broadcasts returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman at the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomates, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the basis of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analytist who is close to the administration and who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the chest may be Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal exercise, which is now very solid proof in public documents.
Mueller also claims to extend the investigation to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interference with our elections.
If the Congress would change, Trump would be put to responsibility in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the voters again, and perhaps eventually a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe that Trump's fall is inevitable – nor for his contradictions in Europe.
We must all be chosen on both sides of the Atlantic which will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a state coup against Hitler, if only the West had risen against him and supported the Czechoslovakes at Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
The course of history is about such vibrations, and the unpleasant March of democracy is accelerated or obscured.
The Americans are faced with several of these vibration points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in harsh weather since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret audiences by the president and wondered that he was inappropriate to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is wrong.
“How would we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote at the inter-election of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we don't stand those tests, democracy will be faced with a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the experiences I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me out to light the Sabbath light on the table with the hake cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in the certainty that the victory of the Austrians after the impressive match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee damage prevented the middleway player Graham Dorrans from making his first performance for the season in the drawback game 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jumping board to make bigger things.
"It was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We went into the game and thought we could get something and got one point.
Maybe we could have nicked at the end, but the equal was probably a good result.
I think they were better at the first time, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
On Thursday it'll be a big night in Europe.
We hope for three points, but it will be hard because they had a good result in the last fight, but with the home public in my back I am sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
Last year was absolutely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good, and the boys enjoy; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, put the past season behind us and make it.”
Women lose night sleep because of fear of pension saving
Although the participants in the study had a clear formation of how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the Nationalwide study said they talked to the mate about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
“ People want to be taken care of by someone in the family, but they don’t do anything to make that conversation, ” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Activity.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not say what you want in advance.
Discussion with the advisor and the family where and how care should be given, for such choices may be of great importance to determine the costs.
Include your financial counselor: The counselor can also help you to find out how to pay for the expenses.
Financial options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance police for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance police with cash value to help cover these expenditure or self-surance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Compare your legal documents: Remove legal problems immediately.
Make a health authority place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that health workers will comply with your desires if you are to be prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some authority over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to hospitals.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write up the details in a list so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake — who’s the doctors? ” asked Martin.
“What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that list in place.'

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a strong earthquake and tsunami that met the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and deaths are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to get information from Donggala rulership, a region north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7,5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a tight Bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and the tsunami.
Donggala is a rulership that extends over 300 km with coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, a administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the barbecues in the central province of Sulawesis, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, at the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also met West Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic fire in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesian Aceh province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that met 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, over half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A strong earthquake met 6.8 in the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast, nearly 700 killed.
2009: A tremendous earthquake 7.6 encountered near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A tremendous earthquake of 7.5 hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters that raged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A large earthquake affected the kingdom of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, while humans were reminded of the devastation of the mortal earthquake and the tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes affect Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested after charges of violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-president candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested after prosecution.
Palin, 29 years from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested after suspects of domestic violence, crushed with a report on domestic violence and contradiction of arrest, according to a report published by Alaska State Police Saturday.
According to the police report, he was supposed to have taken the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged abuse.
Palin is being arrested in the Mat-Su warranty prison and is arrested for an unsafe debt letter worth $500, reported KTUU.
He was presented before the court on Saturday, where he declared “not guilty, absolutely ” when he was asked how he responded to the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A infringements, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and put in a cure of $250,000.
He has also been accused of a infringement of Class B, which can be punished by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time it has been sent for Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the supposed attack.
The case is brought to Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was sentenced for violence at home, crushed with the report on violence in the home, and for holding a weapon while he was drunk in the event.
His boyfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds of killed
At least 384 people are killed after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with strength 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and death rates are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake was affected near the central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thrumped across the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek death penalty for suspected terror attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state of federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, supposedly used a truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit down walkers and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious body injury intentionally, according to an intention to seek death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both these points qualify for possible death penalty, according to the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal major jury 22 pointedal, including eight sentences for murder in connection with monetary extortion, was thrown in the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecutors in matters of organised crime, and a sentence for violence and waste of vehicles.
The attack demanded “significant planning and enforcement”, said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov did it as “horseful, cruel and corrupt.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco”, declares the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time Southern District of New York held a case that could give death penalty.
The prosecutor, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for murdering two drug sellers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, in 1953, for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after the conspiracy of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the detectives that he was fond of what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the assertion.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare himself guilty after the prosecution of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said that they were “offently disappointed ” over the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a confession and lifetime in prison without a possibility of release only will prolong the traumas of these events for all involved,” said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the army of the people" today during a demonstration during the Tory conference.
The former UKip leader said that the politicians would be given the “feeling pressure” from the Eurosceptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrations in Birmingham that Britain would have been deceived now if Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge for May to reconcile its deeply divided rows has been emphasized by pro-Remain Tories who participated in a own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State fights to keep his Brexit plan on the track of the attacks of Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the relapse – and force European shippers and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told the Demonstrants in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He proposed that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan."
When explaining his resistance to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone declared that the referendum had changed since the vote in 2016: “The statement that the British people have changed their views and wants to remain in the European Union is completely wrong.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say: Minister of State, listen to the people.
“The Brexit plan is unpopular in the public, and the opposition will not vote for it; it is unpopular in the party and in our activists, which are actually the ones that trap the streets and get us elected first.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: "State Ministers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage stated that politicians would have “feeling the pressure” if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken by the referendum in 2016.
“This is now about the confidence between us – the people – and those politicians,” he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not escape with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the top of betraying Brexit, feel pressured.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain."
Meanwhile, Remaineers marched through Birmingham before having a two - hour political collection in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists vifted with Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives of security problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
“This are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland”, he added.
"It's a complete pearl.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers seriously as a president candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to "estimate seriously as a president's candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of the future during a Council House meeting west in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elected in November against the Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors, who have used the city house format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she was planning to be a president candidate.
Warren said it's time for "women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting.
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode who killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man that was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near the campus at the Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died as a result,” said police manager Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the place and had weapons with him, and he admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without a suspicion and was in charge of the East Baton Rouge Parish police chamber.
Sims was a two meters high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts the previous season. The average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns per battle.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims towards the world championship title after stallords give him the victory of Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear from that moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stallors would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start, and he almost fed Hamilton off the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first drove into the depot and let Hamilton continue to drive in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pitstop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver opposed the inside to be free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstapen started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21th anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get to a fast finish and overcome Kimi Raikon, which was number four.
Finally, he came through the 44th round depot, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds and the Raikon took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me out.
The team has done a fantastic job to get a good two-span," said Hamilton.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a political event on Saturday for her persistence that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
When the president spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford’s witnesses before the Senate’s Justice Committee, but he commented that the event in the Senate shows that people are “insane, terrible and unsure.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been done in the last days of the Senate, when you experience your mind, when you see people who are angry and bad and terrible and speak false,” he said.
“When you look at deliveries and leakages, they say, “Oh, I haven’t done it.
I have not done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't licked."
Hey, wait a minute.
We licked... no, we didn't leak," he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein refused that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I did not leak her story,” said Feinstein to the Committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidentially, and I kept it confidentially as she asked."
But her denial was not gratified by the president, who during the party arrangement on Saturday night commented: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
“They have decided to take back power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control," said the president, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants had an early two-country ride through shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they hit Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
That was the third meeting of the season between the laws, and Giants had won the three previous battles.
Dwyer’s opening came for four minutes at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull’s help, and David Rutherford set up the game when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned to the home team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt set up to Cownie’s compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer assured that Giants had the leadership at a break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again compensated with a mastery goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nielsen give the Dundee leadership for the first time during the battle late in the second, and he secured the victory with the team's five halfway out in the final round.
Giants, who has now lost four of the last five fights, plays at home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Aeroplane leader dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers escape earthquakes
A flyer in Indonesia is celebrated as after he died and ensured that a plane with hundreds of passengers could be removed safely.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy squads continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of Palu City.
Even after the colleagues had fled for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave their post in the strongly swinging control tower at the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the trackway just then, could safely lighten.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Talsperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australias ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rates may reach thousands, and the country’s disaster protection body reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“The numbers are expected to increase further since many bodies are still captured under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the body.
Up to six feet [6 m] high waves have rashed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Man sees ambulances that are getting dead all the time.
There's a lack of clean water.
The mini markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross works febrilely to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the military: “I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was affected by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports now that a man is missing after the crash in Lagune
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, reporting earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that every Saturday afternoon there was one male passage they had not overlooked.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been transported to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and everyone’s condition was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon right outside the railway.
Some Witnesses believed that the plane was missed on the railway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wave through mid - deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said that the airlines were panicing and screaming and he had a smaller head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a bridge also helped in the rescue work by using a respirable boat to transport people in land before the plane fell about 30 meters below the water surface.
Data from the Aviation Security Network suggest that 111 people have died in crash with PNG-registered planes in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutors ended the procedure on Saturday in a new trial for a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. analytics at the Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile prints to pump the movements of 29 - year - old, Quinton Tellis and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, accused the night she died.
Rowlett said he collected location data from several mobiles that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which struggled with what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same place as Chambers' cell phone in the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the Witness box on Saturday and claimed he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was true when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said he was lying because my trailer was in Nashville.
Another dispute was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile magazines suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telli's call, contact details, messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense will begin its procedure on Sunday after the plan.
The judge said he expected the case to be left to the jury later that day.

A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image to the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims hip hop has moved from the origin of political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make socially gased hips popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have experienced a new flower in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York’s child passes sue pairs for dismissal after “racist” message
A New York childcare officer suspends a pair of discriminatory resignations after receiving a malformed message from her mother, complaining that she was “any black person. ”
The couple rejects their racistity and compares the application to “expression”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she found that Giselle Maurice was black when she met up to the first day of work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEII ENDA EN SWART PERSON”, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the mistakes, a “uncomfortable ” Plasco-Flaxman quit Maurice, claiming that their dismissed childpasser, African, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and was then sent home with a Uber.
Now the Maurice couple suspends for compensation for the dismissal and requires compensation in size order $350 per day for the six - month disposal scheme she was promised, but without contract.
“I wanted to show them that – hello, you just don’t,” she said to New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have turned back against the accusations that they are racist and say the resignation of Maurice was the only right thing, since they felt they couldn't trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she hadn’t meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
“ But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the application for “expression” says Plasco was due to his wife’s having only two months for semester and being in a “very difficult situation.”
“Is there such a person you want to punish?
It's not very nice", added the sharemaker.
While the legal matter goes on, the national court has been quick to condemn the couple of social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The Paddington draft feared that the readers would not accept a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says that the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the child book of a little cloth bear, would have been greatly satisfied with the rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release was “bitter sweet” after he went away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member” and adds that her father was very proud of his success in secret.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a proud person," she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who does a good thing: you are proud of it even though it is not really your fault.
I think he looked at Paddington's success a little like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
At landing, the daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it looked so bad that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I got the phone from Nad that said she would die in two minutes and I had to say good - bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my friend.
I'll be back to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost its effect, and left the system.
She died a while earlier, and the organs in her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there waiting, in certainty that it happened.
I couldn't shout and scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving over the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she had.
"Nobody knew," she says.
“I looked down all the time and the tears ran in a smooth stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards with mourning women to prevent bridge suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers of follk can call for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 years old when he was depressed and killed at 18 years of age.
“ I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day, ” she says.
The 45 - year - old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promising cook with a infectious smile.
"All knew him on the smile.
They said that his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was one of those who found him after he killed his life.
Sharon says, "I'm constantly worried that it's gonna be an infectious effect."
Sharon made the cards “to tell people that there are people out there to go to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself - you need to talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for years, lost Mark, his partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t tell me he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed attitude.
On the first Christmas day, he was completely in the basement – when the kids opened the Christmas gifts, they did not get eye contact or anything.”
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: “There is a big hole in the family.
It's breaking us up.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts research
“I thought that if we could get some of the things he asked for – a time-limited investigation – we might get to a certain consensus,” said Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee “folded apart” along fixed partial boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his republic supporters want the FBI to examine?
The reproach was due to the timing.
The interim options are only five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans probably do it bad, it will be significantly more difficult for them to get the man they want to go to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has called around to senators, driving lobby activities to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and met her wife Ashley there when she was a personal secretary for Bush.
What happens after the FBI's report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him imprisoned in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean scrapers fall under Kim
The number of North Korean apocalypses to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer declared.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Meeting, said that there had been 1127 drops last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most of the choppers from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flies through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China views the prompts as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South — technically still in war — has improved considerably in the last few months.
Previously this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for discussions about the denuclearisation negotiations.
This happened after the historical meeting in June between the U.S. president Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed largely to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US penalties for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions there is no possibility that we will be unilaterally rusting down first,” said Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader of the Representatives’ house, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Candidate "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unable to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the statements in an interview on Saturday during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could only think that if a woman had acted like this, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said on Thursday on his reaction to Kavanaugh’s witnesses before the Senate’s Justice Committee.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual abuse on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotionate in his opening declaration, sometimes he almost shouted and was crying when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democrats of the Committee and called the claims against him a “great and coordinated character murder” organized by liberals who were angry for the loss of the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony shows that he cannot sit in the Supreme Court since it shows that he is predominant against democrats.
"I mean he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in court if he was approved and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I want to say this – if he does not tell the truth to the Congress and the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now in,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is at present Judge at D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abort rights), since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the question Kavanaugh avoided questions whether he wanted to review certain court decisions.
“This is not the time to send a hysterical, partial person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,” said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It is a righteous wrath, months and years of anger, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We weep when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so strange, do you?"
She continues: “I was helped by a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said that she also weeps when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to “you might think I am sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was amazing."
Tears are allowed as the expiry of anger partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs was in a man - dominated office, crying with unexplained anger, and I was gripped in the neck of an elderly woman — a cold boss I had always been a little afraid of — who drove me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're sorry and happy because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic Congresswoman from Colorado at the time, had worked with Gary Hart when he was a president candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to an oath to his spouse on board a boat named Monkey Business and withdrawn from the elections, Schroeder was very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to examine the possibilities of presenting himself as a president candidate.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she said with a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed were one more.
Some called it "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Since it was close to the end of the campaign, she lay behind the funding and sweared that she wouldn’t stop if she didn’t get $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount, or?" she wonders.
When she held her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration of the system that made it so difficult to drive money in and reach choosers instead of delegates, and anger of sexism — that she fell together in cry.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown, ” Schroeder recalls how the press referred to her.
“You should think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember I thought I thought what they would write on my cemetery?
"She cries?"
How the US-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The opening ointments of the trade war between the United States and China were ears deaf, and even though the battle is far from over, a rifle between the countries can be favorable for Beijing in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by paying duty on important Chinese exports, including solar cell panels, steel and aluminium.
The main eskalation occurred this week with new customs rates of goods worth $200 billion, which means duty of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has repayed every time, now in the latest five to ten percent of American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US attacks for attacks, and the second largest economy in the world will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
To get Washington to step down means to give up demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating to the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressures around trade war with the United States can give a long - term positive countout for China by reducing mutual dependency between the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ring effects in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than the audience has seen before”, said Abigail Grace, a researcher colleague focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thoughtsmy.
Syria “clear” for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help to restore the land, which has been raged after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is in progress.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to the progress of combating terrorism,” he says.
The state continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now prepared for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic actions affected by their daily lives and lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime will accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
Yet, he stressed that contingent assistance or assistance from countries supporting the rebellion would not be accepted.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after beating Team USA with a final result of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times after each other on European earth and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recycled the throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn had the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was awkward under large parts of the tournament, wound his tea-beats in the water at pair-3.16 holes, and had to see himself beaten by Francesco Molinari.
