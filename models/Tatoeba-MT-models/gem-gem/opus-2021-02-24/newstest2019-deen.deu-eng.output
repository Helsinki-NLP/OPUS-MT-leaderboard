DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that one comes to the conversation that one also talks to him about why he seems to have felt something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "picture".
Despite the monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed to a certain time that this would be the case," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had explained his retirement from the DFB team in July and also justified it with the reason that Grindel had not defended him against racist adversities during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism to Özil that he is not ready for a conversation with federal trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that when "you leave a team or change a association, you talk about it with your trainer and I'm sorry that this conversation has not yet been achieved."
Linz: Garden hut in Schreberg Artennownlung burned
At 14.13 p.m., the professional firearm Linz was alarmed for a fire in the Angerhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly through the Schreberg Arten settlement, there was a delay in danger.
The vocational fire force went out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the end and fire shoots had to be removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had set up a battery for the shop at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, the charging device was according to firearms in the area of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be detected, as is the cause of fire.
However, he may be considerable, for the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry mother denies: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What has Lindsay Lohan only led to this very strange action?
She seemed to want to remove the children from a claimed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has lively streamed as she seems to want to remove the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial mean of the stream.
Here you see "For luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flee from the actress, Lohan follows the parents and her children.
She prosecutes adults to deal with children.
For all of this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right," Lohan is hearing in the video how she continues following the family along the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obvious wrathful mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress delights how shocked she is - and she keeps her wings.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Sonde "Hayabusa2" started in Japan in December 2014.
It is intended to draw closer to the asteroid Ryugu so much that it can suck material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.

Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Head of Supervisory Board
At the beginning, there was a tweet.
In early August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk announced a withdrawal from the Eletroautobuilder to the stock markets.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla CEO withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but the Chairman of the Board may remain.

Sharp guard - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
On the party day it is intended to deal with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, at the front Front Ex-Ex-Minister Boris Johnson.
Reference for a new state name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state on the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in Northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name duplicates for years.
Now they agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be called Northern Macedonia, and this Sunday is what the people will say about it - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against the right-populist Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the atmosphere is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against the right-popular Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Worker Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" workout lasts longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce still exists," said Peter Mertens' development board on the industry sheet "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, Audi CEO Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all motor/drive combinations were expected to be checked," he said at that time.
Mertens now said: "In early July we reached an important stage goal in the construction of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI drivers.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel scandal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board declined a decision on the future of the citylore and wishes to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities suggest to the Audi CEO that, after the exhaust fraud is known, the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values is authorised.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
The company is currently headed by Bram Schot as Commissioner.
As a result of the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses in Audi, said Schot of the "Heilbronner Voice".
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Scot sets on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi Electroauto, there are already 15.000 reservations.
Grindel seeks re-selection - Lahm should be in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and Özil affair, will again candidate for the office as DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to make her as well as it is," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the "current sports studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the Association would find it "noteworthy" if he after the supplement for the football-EM 2024 had not "the desire to cooperate in the future project".
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach in April 2016.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB federal day on 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Chef Organisator Philipp Lahm is supposed to cooperate in the DFB Bureau, according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues agree in the Bureau that he will be consulted in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, warmly invited to provide his experience in sports issues," said Grindel.
He did not want to participate in speculations, whether his follower could become a DFB-Chef.
As a consequence from the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player without a migration background should become the integration message of the DFB in the future.
Currently, this office operates the buried Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, and the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person without a migration background clearly influences society and football and says, "The topic is important, then we need to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our associations in places where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Decrease correctly with semi-smart weight
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat.
Muscle and bone mass can also show them.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's rather for the wrist.
He doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscles.

Erdoğan opens Moschee in Cologne
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Moschee in Cologne on Saturday.
==References====External links======External links======External links==
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan invited the German government to deliver living followers of the Gülen movement in Germany and to take action against Kurdish Separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisants of the PKK or golden movement to shake our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Moschee, the Cologne center was partially locked.
Several thousand policemen were in operation - among them also scarf shooters.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is deemed to be the extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhcalls and Horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for more engagement in the fight against poverty and disease at a joint concert in the New York Central Park.
"Be engaged wherever you can only," said Mendes at the festival in the night on Sunday before about 60,000 audiences.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and willing to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and auxiliary organisations showed themselves at the multi-hour spectacle on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a terrible second when many spectators thought the noise of a falling metal creature for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Soon panic arose, people ran apart.
Seven spectators had been easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin reassured the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free of charge as each year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to be married had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors, the audience was happy and applause - books for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although he spoke together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for more equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke to the US Senat's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge at the Supreme Court and thus kicked many women in the head.
At least three women have suspected abuse until attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake demanded a FBI investigation of charges, after two women who have experienced their own sexual abuses, faced him on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also like to meet in an elevator with me at any time," Flake now said at the concert in New York about the audience.
Freedom of press: Federal Government defends the cast of the journalist
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the ruling of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German label "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone first.
The T-shirt, if not the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance of the expiry of the press conference.
The journalist's action has caused a strong disturbance, which is unacceptable.
That's why he caused person protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are subject to claimed spying activities or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah golden movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failure of the push attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threatened to prison several decades.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: Only early September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of prisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had ensured supervision.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still processes against them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well-looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at that twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actress was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for moist-friend conversations at the theke of Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, hits some beer, some wine or even more high-percentage drinks to attract the mood and tongues.
Not a few promises also drink courage for compulsory singing deposits.
On Friday another sequence of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Greatest Day".
The Münchner did not get the trip to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a self - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes only two small sleeves.
The Bed Selfie shows a completely luminous Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he has only a powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - insights that he has now won: "Rule one: Don't go to Inas night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And a syringe.
And the round of eggs that Ina swoops at half three leaves away as well.
The alcohol consumption is truly written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted just a few tips to combat distress.
They were enough of instant browns, fishbreads or - probably the most targeting - headache tablets.
Others just enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive Kinostar.
As Ina Müller has overcome the night's lap, it is not known to date.
Since it has been moderating the TV fun at the theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tester...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrath
The entrance into the 36 kilometers long railway in the Red Cup country in Treysa is difficult to find and disperse.
Recipes against the grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly distinct.
Sharpening, cigarette chickens, waste and unrat, demolated trash and now demonstrated signs - since long time the entrance has been presented with a seat group to the cycling road on the Haße hill in Treysa.
For the foregoing object Railway in the Red Cup country, a more than unfamiliar view.
The topic has been addressed by members of the ADFC site group Schwalmstadt, but others have been discussed longer, according to the cycling officer of Ulrich Wöstenhagen City.
The problem has already been addressed by the Council of Bicycles.
There is no solution yet.
The proposals range from the transfer of the seat group to the regular clearance of the waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the commandment of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Desert Copenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic was also brought into the local council.
Not only the waste travels bicyclers and residents - the seat group is a regular meeting point to celebrate on weekends.
It is not only often loud, the layers are also destroyed: peppers ripped out of the earth, trash demolated, shields knitted around, seat furniture decorated.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the word-writing drops on the hot stone.
You're upset that the racing area on the cycling road is in Treysa's place to meet.
"Beside the entire cycling path here is clearly the focus on the Haße hill," the cycling officer, who is now concerned about the new cycling site in goathain that is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it'll be pretty expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hill: "There may be a significant increase in the threshold of breaking into the community.
However, this would require that there will be a police line in time.
In principle, Desert Cenhagen wants to develop the Haße Hügel.
He needs to be more attractive.
The speculation of the cycling path to date could be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expansionable.
Our cycling path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical risk station.
There's no turning track on the hate hill.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the transport flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the Cultural Train Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the Lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city district-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "in the sympathetic Hiltrup family with eye-swinkings", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family with each other at coffee and cake from the honorary officials of the Cultural Train Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Himig, a long albanian living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Blackies.
This contest, according to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a news.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city yet.
What were the texts associated with?
The Hiltrup Sea and the marketalles were particularly often mentioned at the sites.
Rolf Himig circumvented all the songs in his shameful song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Culture Station was also appreciated.
Once again, it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short rebuilding breaks with short interviews with the artists or suggestions on their creation.
Thus they learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemicals, but now he also taught guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schmelmann, Franke knew that the recently occurred in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And in the meantime, Alvin Jasic has placed all kinds on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltrup's gastronomy.
Yet there was something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others could also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schimmelmann.
Further musicians can play a song: Him with his Hiltrup camp, who particularly impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers of guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the final again - and even sounded "rightly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
Leden was able to make the jury of the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, entering the melody and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City District Offensive.
The district offensive had introduced the event from its ten-year-old existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams who sit together.
For each page there is a screen of view, in which four cards have keywords, which can be discriminated - the old trick with the red slide - only when you put them in.
Thus it is ensured that the opposite can not read anything by accident.
For example, on the cards, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Two windows.
Third dice.
Fourth party.
These are the terms that are now to be encrypted.
Because it is not the terms, but codes to be guessed here.
Alternatively one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which might be "3.4.2".
They should be advised in "decrypto" not the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: in this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "cube", "Fest" and "window" in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponential team as far as possible; for it wins the party if it fails to knock the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Warp" for the dice, "lease" as contrast to the festival; here would of course also be something like "party" and "prag" because he was watching at school and knowing the window crash there.
That's how it goes round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the concepts of the opposite - it can be better combined with any reference given by the encryptor there.
If possible, mysterious, but not too distorted, the rescriptions should be so, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptical of "decrypto" is the rules.
The players must probably study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The declaration video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has let go once, will be fascinated how much feeling is in this invisible game.
In total, however, "decrypto" is not as firm as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also suggests a agent to a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And who's only about rating and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and disturbing guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man worked the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday on Sunday equally twice.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the upper city of a passing police line, and later he also found in the upper city in a trick when he disturbed other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the place reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at Kulmbach Police Inspection at the prison cell.
In a fastening state, he must also be criminally responsible for the use of marks of constitutional organisations.
Working Pressy was the home of the shoe blocks
The railway operation in Pressig has been the rotation sheet in Frankenwald for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
"When buffers knocked on buffers, it was heard in full pressure," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the railway station.
That didn't make anybody up.
There also the brakes were silent and the wagons kicked.
It was pure railway.
Pronunciations that are symbolic for Dinkels homeland pressy.
Nowhere in Frankenwald, a place was so characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain range to the north, which has its hill point in Steinbach at the woods after an increase of about 220 hectares.
In order to handle this, earlier train and shoe blocks were needed that had their home in pressy.
In 1901 the Bavarian landing day approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, teaching workshops, driving and railway mastery.
"The heartpiece was the roller that had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, rail historian and 47 years of occupational railways.
The station (BW) Pressig, which was subject to Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the next routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northern Halfs.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a 160-man personnel; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in pressy at the time.
The electricalisation of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 walls were ranged per month.
Parts of the work were cancelled in 1982, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not seen a better use of the site, including in the point of goods transport."
At Pentecost 1989, the train director Nürnberg celebrated a pumpous railway station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years Electricity Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were 10 000 enthusiastic spectators here," remembers Georg Dinkel.
It'll be a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangerbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The rankiers and inhibitors did the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Railway Station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images are here in the inflictedPlus article.
Kerber with optact follow-up at China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledonsieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.

In the "Art and Enjoy" series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittehrenbach in the weekend.
With great ease registered organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, opened the Special Vernissage "Windspiel Performance".
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Enjoy".
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor claim showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelärernbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He's been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprising but announced Hahn his retirement a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he placed his task in proven young hands with good future perspectives.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and have contributed to flyers in the past.
Also this year, at the occasion of art & enjoyment, there is a 70-cents special letter brand designed by them, available at every art station.
There, too, this year's poster "bents" can be designed by Volker Hahn, purchased for eight euros.
He was pleased with the high demand of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler was won from Nuremberg for the musical frame.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses player.
It is artworks of metal or ceramics, often with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor at the right side of the "Happy Tree" is expected by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree steam, colourfully brightened, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hives and 24 alu tubes as a soundpiece.
With the sun in the background through the bushwork, the object works softly and invites to stay.
From Eckental Barbara washneck, which prefers in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On half the route, Siegrid Frey from Eckental issued her work "The Wind the heavenly child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows its colorful imagination of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The topic "Windspiel-Performance" to swallow through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition may be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albattes: singer celebrate 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albaths also made their distress at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to find out that after the resolving of the church crown "Cäcilia" there should be no singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the Tinbush they raised the MGV 68 Albanians from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was great in "The House of Meeting".
"It'll be full today," said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanians singers.
For the anniversary, they had relived the foundation feast.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break first.
At the end of the 50-year-old existence, the tradition festival was back.
A elegant ball was asked for festive clothing before.
The guests were not sitting in seat rows like otherwise in the "House of Meeting" but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, movement was suggested: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pulled the controllers and asked to the dance surface.

Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The upstairs march.
Three games, three victories - the USC Münster reserve under the screen rule of Axel Büring is quite right in Liga three.
No trace of screaming or fractures, the independents make their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite good.
"It wasn't clear, but we have already left an impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker insisted immediately: "This is a defeat that we can live very well with.
We are not dissatisfied." On the contrary.
In the evening at a post-day birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game cut off.
Yes, the result is in fact an optical deception.
In the third sentence, the guests had a setball.
"If they bring it into the goal, such a game can be chicken," Büring knows years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full exploitation into the goal.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our neck.
I've seen quite good Volleyball in phase," Annacker didn't hate the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.
Where the trip is going for the independents, after just three playdays, does not seem to be seen.
"For that it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one, he feels confirmed: "The Third League has an incredibly good level.
With regionalliga-volleyball, this is not closely comparable." In the fourth league they do not want to turn their view down anyway.
If the West is not being polluted in the next few weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven parties.
On Saturday, we'll go to Emlichheim first.
Aasee arrives in dinner on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Hede Keller became a star on the "Throme Ship".
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have been involved in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chiefhostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Throomship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went from board forever.
The series that led her to be a star could be responsible for her failure to marry Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"It could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world, and many of my admired colleagues saw me in the height of my eyes," says Keller in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
At first she was always "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but this changed with the "traumship".
Because now the journalists called only at Heide Keller.
"I don't know if he liked it."
She thinks it's possible that her then man could have been quite jealous, but "how many men also screwed his conversations about problems and feelings."
Keller always tried for Hans von Borsody to be the only right and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've made it," as she continues.
She always felt that she wasn't good enough for him.
He saw in me a emancipated woman that I was never really, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage with Thomas Härtner, the cellar said again yes, "though I was afraid that it could also go wrong another time."
On the day before the total wedding, I was crying in the garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never did it work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone too naive to love."
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ Ressort Zurich, has this time awakened to the ZFF opening party.
Our folding is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the grey glory in which a green carpet is tucked on the six-sixth place, bleachs him over the fee.
But it's keeping film festival, where more or less famous ones want to sun in the light of light.
Thus, on this late Thursday evening, he turns over the place to make it easy in the "Aquaclean WC-Oase".
Thus, the public toilet facilities, sponsored by a large sanitary company, celebrate their premiere at the festival: The needs institution in the parterre of a new pavilion is a lot of effort to stream a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it smells in the Lord's Oase for some reasons to heaven.
So out here, over on the other side of the street: Invited guests who have enjoyed the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the movie, celebrate the festival beginning each year with a party in the three-stage shop.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: From all the earthballs are known to come from the works shown.
What do you have to do with an article about this festival, so that you do not fall into a reclame for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds a tie around the foils that have placed a good fee to him, and two bully doormen actually vibrate him generously.
Inside, the charges, they dance far after midnight to live music or are pretended by DJ Rhythms to which they yell each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite pendants.
In the delicate shop in the souterrain, the easter is waiting for slurring mouths, besides the incomparable raw cucumber Culatello di Zibello is cut freshly, a chocolate fountain is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales panels full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without large losses.
You must love this country for it!
The fold studys the shield at the wheel stairs: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the wheel stairs."
If it's two separate instructions, he's stayed in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it's certainly saved life.
In the household goods department at the upper floor, the poultry cocktail is caught with espresso prepared with the name "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, will not be forced.
And George Clooney, who has been wearing a brand for years, isn't here on the evening either.
However, between local prominence, cash table and kitchen articles, a face that appears known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It's probably not far from his main actors.
And really: At the same time, Viggo Mortensen, with almost 60 almost acting like a chorknabe, walks through the quantity.
He's not being pleasant, he's not doing it, he's not being stolen.
Just for this restraint, like misunderstood as a blame, international stars love this film festival.

They hadn't played bad - as in stone gardens, like against shelterhorst - over wide phases, the transmitters.
Only the beginning phase "we've been totally sleeping," the ASV trainer was angry.
Soon the houselords with 8:1, even the early time that Bieletzki had taken, did not fruit at first.
"Then suddenly a back went through the team," Bieletzki assembled the second quarter hour.
For a break, the residue was only two gates.
Especially sending's best, Marius Hintze, met in the phase another time.
After the change, it became even better from visitor view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst was equal to 15:15, and then the swap switch almost carried through.
Four minutes before the sirene, the forespring was still seemingly resting three hits (29:26).
And then?
Intervene in the unparty.
Bieletzki usually avoids seeking the guilt with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff took, "was a joke."
LIT had laughed well and hit to the end four times - during the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, backwards also standing well against seven men and thrown onto the empty gate again and again.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory" said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV tower: Hints (9), Sergeant (6), Slag (4), Kreatsmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pole (2).

The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers in the network.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts on the network.
In addition, security updates, such as Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to fit computers with antiviral protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has missed his threatening deployment as head of the billions of heavy companies.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervisor SEC annexed to an extrajudicial dispute on misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost the permission to lead börsnotated companies.

He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter supporters, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share that the funding was secured.
This would be a total of $72 billion for Tesla.
Later, Musk roared back: Tesla stays on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a foreign chairman, set up two independent board members and also set up a committee that monitors Musk's communication.

Inquiries: 46 percent do not want Merkel as a Chancellor until 2021
After the crossings of the past weeks, the GroKo discards several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - AfD has the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a counter to 17 per cent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 per cent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday Bundestagswahl, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
This is why the great coalition is currently lost by all major research institutes - except Allensbach - in the matter of Sunday.
The government parties are totally 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestagswahl, they received 53.4 percent together.
The bandwidth is also large for the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, is 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting rates from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10%, FDP on 9%.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent up and down depending on the proportion of the vote.
However, the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also decreased significantly since the Federal Day election in 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of Kanzler, as the Emnid survey showed in the order of the BamS.
Only every second (50 per cent) wishes the survey up to date that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal day election in three years, 41 per cent are for a new choice.
Also, in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been significant popularities for Merkel.
Divided Germans also assess whether Merkel should reconsider the CDU Presidency in December.
47 percent are, according to Emnid, 44 percent.
Hence, 64 per cent of EU supporters want a candidate, 35 per cent not.
Outhanging at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Does Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder there are no more romantic scholarly stories - it should talk to Aldi about poultry meat.
Munich - In times of the digital "Fast Food-Datings" by Tinder and Co. the supermarket as an acronist location for the great love is almost an anakronistic romantic.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced carpet meat, boxershort snacks at the Wühlbord or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than a just swipe to the right.
The App Tinder is in the reputation to be less a contact but rather a sleek stock exchange.
We have awakened the test: how do women react, not long in the first message about the hot brei?
Here is the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory Potenzial will have it when love luck precedes an out-the-eye-missing and-recovered plot.
If the guy still reports to his worshiper under the e-mail address bio-putenmeat@gmx.de, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she would wish to find her dreamer, with whom she has talked shortly about the "30 percent reduced bio-pound meat".
For her faith in the magic of analogal knowledge learning, she deserved at least her Happy End à la Hollywood.

Football: District Liga: Researchers appearing the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine encourages
There were moments in this young season, and Alois Fetsch went to the court with his hard.
Wortkarg, the coach of the Football Districtist VfL Wolbeck, first retreated (inside) to reflect on the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it's going around again on the Brandhove Road.
Taufrier Beleg is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past time only shrink thin at the rise.
Yes, I'm very pleased with the appearance.
"We made the rooms tight and pressed on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch commended his boys and came to each individual for the party to simply say "thank you" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him, Luca Rehberg came from the 4-4-2 almost naked over to a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited for balls at the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his ex (17th), the interchanged Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
Almost would have revenged when the SCA in Minute 41 was twice personalized by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberboomer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his expertise.
After the break, the VfL took over the full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed hardly.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes input.
With the exchange of Mile's case, Fetsch of the left side missed a fresh cell cure again.
When Oldenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, 18 meters before the guest house, there was an indirect release for the placelords.
The vulnerable approached himself and demonstrated his danger with standards.
Westhues" Things with the right sleeve hit the bottom left from the view of the shooter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty more minutes that should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flyed the leather in the chamber in the 80th minute unfortunately.
Dividing judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive wolbeck in the final phase, before he had the victory on the pouch in the 87th minute of 12 meters.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

When a helicopter was landed, turbulence was found, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The Heli was captured by a windbow, forced on the ground and came to the ground.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in corporate boards
Only 8 percent of the boards were female on the first September, as shown in the report "The Power of the Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will cross them," said the foundation business leader Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-occupied leaderships - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The residue makes German competitors less diversified, innovation-friendly and future-oriented.
It is another business culture.
In addition, the small increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is due only to positive impulses in the enterprises of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
Although, according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years pre-ritters - the proportion of women stagnated.
Last time 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit again consistent women in the next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would continue to take no self-obligation to increase the proportion of "zero percent" to date.
Another picture is found in the supervisory boards: On 1 September, the female share was 30.5% - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"Reclaimed the same number of women for the boards each year, a percentage of 40 per cent would have been reached in 2023," says the report.
Some even make mises: luxury cards: Which manufacturer deserves mostly per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take with each sold Ferrari 280,000 euros and make 69,000 euros operating profits.
Large cars, great profits: This slogan is still valid today - in most cases.
Who makes most profit per car among the precious providers.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers who sell them per car?
This question has been addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhafer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made operating profits with each sold car 69,000 euros in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover comes only to about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even to each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in race with prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros profit before interest and tax EBIT.

Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian has been fatally injured in Bonn in the collision of a car with a taxi.
The taxi drivers, the physician and their drivers were severely injured, as the police informed.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had taken over a red ampel on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then stood on a crossing with the taxi riding at Green.
After the collision, the doctor car kicked against an ampelmast and a tree.
He captured the Passent who died still on the accident site.
Chauffeur of the emergency car and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be exempted from operating forces.
The also severely injured 29-year-old physician could free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another accompanying emergency doctor tried to do this - but without success.
The three seriously injured persons were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close coordination with the Bonner State Prosecutor, determine who is blamed for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we do it uncomfortable
After the blamable from the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
On West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat may still be speaking.
Similarly, the scene was in the 74th minute in which the re-generated Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford probably led the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the passport of Mark Nobel, all the defendants of Manchester remained standing, and Arnautovic was all the time of the world to shoot the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of previously inadequate performance.
It is quite different at the moment in the Uniteds City of Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos large competitors, Pep Guardiola, came to an unwanted 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team broke through the defense of the outsider for the first time.
Sergio Agüero provided for the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former port shooter, and thus also for the jump to the table tip.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2-degradation in the ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londons.
The 27-year-old meeting in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation hardly after 70 minutes.
Better Daniel Sturridge did it in the 89th minute with his sleezer.
So after the Reds were started with a faultless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp's team in the cup, and the remis in the league also crashed the Blues Liverpool from the table tip.
Like City, the two London City Clubs also celebrated Todtenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (with Watford) 2:0-winning.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played, had to tolerate a success message until the 81th minute on the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defense Craig Cathcart broke up a hereinput of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into its own gate, only two minutes later, Mesut Özil with his third season occurrence made the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory in succession of Watford, is newly located right behind the large rival Todtenham on Rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave Upstairs Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained unbeaten at 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a sequence and prove the 8th place.
VW core mark missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris car salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - officially no topic and yet present: The Diesel scandal and the rings for driving bans and re-matching should not be released by the German car companies at the Paris industry meeting.
From the next week, at the 2018 automobile salon, they show their new things together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not really play a major role anymore.
The possible exchange and refreshment offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, would be an important issue at least behind the shiny scenes of the fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is involved with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are here and include their first pure electrical models: The e-tron of the Ingol towns is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But both were officially presented.
The iNext by BMW should start only 2021.
The new 3er is the focus in Paris.
Overall, over 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
Besides car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair that celebrates its 120th birthday this year will take place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, about one million visitors arrived.
At least 380 people have died in the heavy earthquakes and the following tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured people.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second had the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, and there have been tremendous damage to matters.
After the earthquake, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach to a festival.
It is feared that the numbers of victims are still significantly high.
The figures have come from Palu only so far.
However, many other communities are also concerned - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
Approximately 150 bikes celebrate worship in Werdahl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service of the motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdahl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikes was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the psychiatric concerns of the PS strong two-cycle drivers.
Between April and September always takes place on the last Sunday of a month of traditional motorcycle goddess service (MoGo) at the Nordhelle house.
The conclusion of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Peace Church in Eveking.
On Sunday, about 150 bikes were gathered there to do anything else than regular worship.
Already from 10:00 p.m. the Bolides were set up before the church's entrance portal.
First of all, the bikers were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a defty curry worst.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were included.
The preach was held during the Biker-Gottes service of Pfarrer Dirk Gregorek.
The songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical painting.
"But the bikes prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetic-called tons," said Father Frank Schröder.
This was certainly also a novum in the history of motorcycle gods service yesterday.
Fuchtorfer Home Association celebrates a great festival: After the apple comes the milk
And Borish was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Great interest also raised Georg Hartmann-Nieemerg.
He had his apple press in the baggage and demonstrated his amazing audience step by step the process from the mature apple to the apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Neverg leave the children the field, and let them fill the apples in the great tricker.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely broken mass.
I don't think many of the children could imagine how they should get a tasteful drink.
However, they were also able to look at this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and wrapped by networks, Georg Hartmann-Nieemerg stacked the somewhat like häckel goods layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice walked into a large vessel.
However, the fertilizer farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "saet box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in fertilizer" was similarly large.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press but also discovered the built hipburg for themselves.
Active of the Fuchtorfer companionship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited some stations to play short-term games.
The home association will also offer a day of action next year.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season plan: "Shot situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth degradation of the Bundesliga, trainer André Breitenrichter gathered his disappointed professional of Hannover 96 around himself and couraged them.
However, there was a lot of positive things before 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt not to see.
"It's a terrible situation, but you need to get out as a team," said the 96-Football Profi Pirmin Schwegler and pushed out, "This is naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further sieglosous Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met to connect, stands with two counters down the bottom and is a declining candidate in their current constitution.
On the contrary, the superior Ante Rebic celebrated Frankfurt the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB-pocalcier, who, after the successful general sample for the Europe-League game against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatian Vice-Weltmeister Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action of the Hessen and never managed by Hannover's defense.
The WM longly attacked storms showed with its pace and enforcement ability why it is so valuable for enthusiasm.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed by the FC Liverpool was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began vigorously.
Lucas Torro (17.) was first endangered by a distorted headball to the gate network.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a prospective position in the last moment from the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short term Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership for the houselords fell almost necessarily and fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defected corner in the penal room, Haller extended by head before the gate, where Ndocka only needed to keep the foot.
It was the first counterparty for the defense player who came in the summer by the French secondlichist AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who could be thought through and didn't allow 96-torwart Michael Esser.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach broad rider responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxons now played a little more courageously forward, inflamming ideas remained up to shortly before the end, however, when the connection was still achieved.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed a cross on De Guzmán, which only had to move the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against exaggerated guests, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Thrusts Despite cool temperatures, there was good mood at the October Festival in the city centre.
Münchener Oberburger Meister Dieter Reiter created it before millions of public at the opening of the 185.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christian celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Creuz Fest on September 14, or Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the church of the city, then is a procession to the Holy Creuz Church with the Final Own.
The Holy Creus Church hosts the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and is supposed to have shot on the legend after a Swedish soldier.
From the shot wound, then blood flows.
This led to a great cruise to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Creus Church.
This has not been built until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the significance of the Geisinger parish, the service had been visited badly.
After the worship, the procession took place to the Holy Creuz Church and with the final sight ended the church part of the Cross Festival.
For many years, the Catholic Church NChor has then invited to the worldly part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The choir members provided visitors with warm food as well as a wide range of cakes and weather adapted, farmhouseeis.
On the afternoon, the parish community still offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Sieger informed the visitors about the damage to Fassade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue to take place until the next year.
After a period of time, the damage could be more accurately detected and the individual tenders were more specifically prepared.
It is certain that renovation comes more expensive than planned, because the damages already existing a few years ago have grown, but more has been found, which was only possible by the inauguration of the ears.
The soccer pollution work is complete, the winter is still supposed to be started with the natural stone work and one hopes to be able to finish the half of these work this year.
Introduction: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münster Viewstraße
Life aid Donau-Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münster View Street.
The fact that in the Münster View Street, "a very special house" is now being delivered to his destination - there was agreement with all the attendants at the dedication date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have already lived in the home of the Danube-Iller living in the lives for some time have been dependent on the special architecture of the reconstruction.
Wide walks, hallways and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas has taken account of Rudolf Bader's concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago, when the former officer building of the US Army was placed on the test level for the mobile inhabitants: "The house had come into the years and no longer in time in the equipment," said Bader backwards.
In 2016, the baggers drew to rip the house.
The reconstruction should be designed as friendly and bright as possible, so that the inhabitants can feel well, according to the architect.
Life aid Donau-Iller Opens new home
About €4.6 million invested life aid in the reconstruction.
The free state granted EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
The construction work has remained in the planned framework, according to architect Bader, as well as financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Assistance, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and simultaneous fire-safe construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allow the inhabitants to experience freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social management of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the particular needs of its inhabitants, which need help to be mobile."
The living and functionality have been well combined, said Creutmayer.
And further, "The property in this situation is a real happiness because it is no longer available in today's situation."
Overall, the new home in the Münster View Street offers space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three groups of residents, on nearly 1500 square meters.
Proud is life-help business leader Heinz on the eleven full-time forces who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Swesig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unit, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to all the people of the country not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unit.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday.
The objective must remain to create the same life conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked in average longer than the people in West Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can explain this to nobody almost 30 years after the German unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this ugly dog end the Korean conflict?
The one year Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngjang made the South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office informed on Sunday, the two old dogs reached their recipients already on Thursday.
They then took place in Panmunjom, together with three kilos of dogfood to "enabling" the animals.
The dogs with the thick white skin, spitting ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced to the north at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in the middle of September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions, such as the Olympic Games in 2020, and to apply together for the exhibition of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the test system Tongchang Ri for missile drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What's Austria?
At the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this Memorial year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have appeared, mostly answering this question to the past hundred years.
It is quite different from that of Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Picture Book", Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - so is the inofficial motto for today's starting working week of the Great Coalition.
Nearly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU last did not mantraly swore the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, kassiers and other employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but if it is.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its task again - to the government - then it should not be stopped with conceptual debates now.
If the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamages of the last few weeks, it may already show on Monday.
In the evening, the tops of the government parties meet the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to call this round on a regular basis to uncover conflicts early; a lesson from all the disputes.
Firstly, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel refugees and the Immigration Law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums slip away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty for technical rehabilitation of older diesel.
While there has been an approach in the Diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the planned law on the immigration of professionals.
The SPD calls for a lead perspective for rejected asylum candidates who work or do training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "trading" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal have joined GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Conflict is good.
Without a dispute, a society of so many, sometimes contradictory interests does not lead forward.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute should not be reconstructed for partical reasons for the question of His or His nonsense.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should be argued - but always have the life-effectiveness of people in mind.
What can be done and benefits many?
With this lead question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmaticly cleared - and thus recover confidence.
In particular, the people's parties now have to fight.
Sulphur checks working hours at Hardinger
Minister in Vision
Does the Ministry of Labour infringe the current law of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to see this more accurately.
"Every day and night" would have worked on social security reform, a overwhelming social minister reported at the presentation of itself two weeks ago.
At list-Pilz-Mandatenrin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is awful - she now brings the matter to Parliament by request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not at all to announce infringements of existing service law before running cameras".
Yet, she now has questions to be able to "free Harer" from any suspect.
Police rides a road on looking for women's body
MarxGreen - Lange didn't want to say that.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, Steben is buried on the state road between Naila and Bad.
The route is locked in the MarxGreen area until Monday.
The detectives had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with his guide, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters in several times of use.
In addition, together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority in the area of the stated road piece, a soil anomalia was discovered.
For more than a year, public prosecution and criminal police have already been working on the missing case.
Once again, a cycling route was locked up and examined with sonar devices at MarxGreen, because the detectives suspected that here, as part of the new construction of the State Road, Heike's body could have been distorted 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalls in Barcelona before Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's coming to crowns before.
Separatists have not forgotten the autumn 2017 police operation.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of October 1, 2017, there were conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder in order to prevent them from getting closer to a demonstration of the National Police and Civil Guard.
About 3,000 police officers of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in use last year at the referendum classified as illegal in the elections.
When attempting to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the some 6,000 separaters would then have tried to break through the police chain with violence, and the officials, among other things, were thrown with colour bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 others had been easily injured, it was called upon to the authorities.
On Monday, the first year is the reference for independence.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid Catalonia had placed forced management in autumn 2017.
The former regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the former regional government and other activists of the separatist movement continue to sit in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
Following the office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced management was terminated.
However, the new regional president Quim Torra is also in favour of the 'right of self-determining' of the Catalans.
Football: Upperliga Westfalen: Uncommon Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torless
Red-white agels continue to step on the place.
Also at the FC Gütersloh it only reached a 0:0-decision.
The final light, and the third last, they uncovered before 438 audiences in the Heidewald Stadium as collected fraudlessness.
The first half was overlookable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, those who would prefer to pick up a beer or a bratworst could do this without worry.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was virtually no.
First shot after half an hour
Responsible for the first (harmless) trap shot of the entire party signed goodsloh's Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - way the Ahlener had, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes had a shot from the penal space border to a parade.
The hosts were even harmlesser.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged injuriously, for him, Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute Sebastian Mützel, from 18 meters, focused hardly over the cabinet and after an hour, the goods lovers also appeared openly for the first time.
After a ball conquest by Matthew Wieckowicz, it went well.
The rapidly presented account about Sinan Aygün "County" Nick Flock (62.) with a lazy shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they had a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after an ex-agener Tim Manstein's cornerball.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91th minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it didn't bring anything in.
Angelo Daut endeavored to strike out the positive: "I like that we played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood ahead.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were still against wood wickede and that, although our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlen's interim trainer found.
Offensive "placed everything so a little" against a team, "which just wanted to defend.
Anyway, I didn't feel like we could get a counter door," said Daut.
However, as a spectator, they did not feel like his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too necessitated for this.
Crown fields Thanksgiving Market: Fortunately, there are plenty of creams
The Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are delighted by the Räkenfelder table issue for which these donations are intended.
The honorary officials assure: "These donations remain in the field of receipt."
At the opening, the sky appeared brilliantly blue, but the space was still somewhat empty, but this should still change in the course of the day.
For, "Here it is so nicely soling, that's why we're here today," said one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a proper Humor Prize.
For the Brockmann couple, which was supposed to be weighted against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in the short term.
The Verena (daughters of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's plenty of creams.
And the "replacement" could not be used to entertain the increasing number of visitors in musical terms.
This came so well that later an hour some people songs were sung.
"Simple great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Venemeyer was able to spend the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many assets with their cities, including mainly associations.
"In fact there should not be something like a table," he still thanked for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek commended the use of all those in operation at the cities and included the further festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful stroke - there's something going on.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd took off the cork with the help of the firearm and brought it to the winter quarter.
Many cities have been worked for physical welfare.
From sweet to heartful was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, has become creative in his decupier saw.
Furnierwork, beer deck with ranking fields motives and some more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three rank fields imker: "Reckfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschlütern.
The latter has another speciality.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to get back again, as well as the cake tasted.
The sociality is that the visitors have stayed long to the evening hours, even without stage programs that are not available at the autumn festival.
Smoking with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate installation
In Lengerich, unknown ones have hardly promoted the construction of a skate system.
In several places there are corresponding butterflies, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, police warrants have been issued for injury.
In large letters, the three words "Scate Park for Lengerich" appeared on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the vocational elections on September 19, a corresponding writing was discovered on the advertising sign on the staircase to Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of the time seemed to have been left "only" with an edding, it could have been removed without problems.
"Not a few days later, it was then back there, this time sprayed," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given just this case by calling on the table on several large companies from Länggarich.
If the skate system is built, it is also intended to allow the realisation of it by sponsors.
There are promises already, explained Jörg Hesselmann from the urban sector of school, sport and culture, without name.
Well possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the broken table.
For years, local policy and administration have been focusing on the topic of Skate installation.
After the old one had been cut off at the LWL clinic, after a while the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted mostly for the fire parking.
However, this admonition was not implemented - too many factors seemed to have spoken against a construction in this place.
At the end of June, a turn was followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It is based on a decision this year, so that a positive vote 2019 could be built.
Close pass in flight security becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, German airlines do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm will come," said the Chef of the Air Safety Company, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the airline summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and delays in flights is the long-known personal need for European air navigation, for which there is no fast solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots will take four to five years," said the trade unions.
The market for fully trained lots was empty throughout Europe.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas once again criticized the fact that various air trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, representatives of the Bundes, the countries, airlines, airlines and airports meet in order to deal with the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work defence and overtime, this won't go without us," explained the GdF's head, who has many members in the German Air Safety Federation.
Maas once again made the EU Commission's standards responsible for the lotsing mikes.
Transport forecasts for the current regulatory period until 2019 had been far too low.
The costs and personal savings derived from the national air navigation security are now fully dependent on the operational business.
Maas appealed to Bundesverkehrsminister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) in Brussels for regulations that "not further cut off the air".
At present, EU data would be voted by 2024 and there would be further worsening fears.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobby printing by airlines.
"Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now harvested exactly what they have seeded in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delay costs of airlines will lead to a change in mind.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "similar training and future pact", said Maas.
The up to date announced recording of 120 lotsing students over the next five years was just enough to compensate for the age-related courses.
The necessary staff building is not yet linked to this.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board is responsible for corporate construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the restructuring of the Group.
According to the will of Chief Guido Churchhoff, who was appointed Chairman of the Board on Sunday, the crisis group should be divided into two independent societies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and are listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction in staff beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two retirements, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are facing them.
However, the final decision is expected to take a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is intended to be linked with elevators and supply.
Barcelona: Violence with demos of police and Catalan independence advocates.
Two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have made violent conflicts with many injured people.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered together on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
However, according to the staff, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break through the security locking.
They would have attacked the officials with color and throw shots.
Rangeleien was also reported between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me that there were six arrests.
Better salaries and evaluation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police had wanted to declare the colleagues who had done almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish Central Government in Catalonia.
At the same time they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civilists feel that it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they.
The demonstrators felt it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why have they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they cheated us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearians, who wanted to mention his name only with Daniel, rejected the prosecution.
"Of course we want to support our companions who only made their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for implementing our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," assured the policeman.
Panne allowed access to personal data British Minister
A safety gap in a mobile app led to the temporary access of the personal data of Ministers and Members of the Conservative British Tory Party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown ones after the panne became known one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises by top party: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star storm has played "the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) win of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensive Star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and doing good," said Allegri.
Although we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and we have grown from the moment.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three gate models, Juve turned the game after the early residue through the Tres Mertens (10th minute) and first depended on the worst persecutor.
First, the real Madrid gathered thorn hunter gave up the former federal league professor Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo, after a corner by headball, also worked for the meeting of defense manager Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who had only to push in shortly before the gate line.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
However, Allgri also wants to see gates of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record tower shooter.
"We have to get even better in serving him," asked the coach.
Best Juve Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ superpower seems to become even more impressive.
Seven Siege in seven games is the flawless series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the relapse seven years already has six counter predominant jumps on Naples.
The table range trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not chanceless against Turin.
But the top party was decided at the latest after the spot reference of the already confused Mario Rui (58.).
The Portuguese had to go too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow rot from the place.
"We have played well against a good naple," commented the Turin Coach.
It also allowed Emre Can to feel.
The German national player has gone through with Juve.
The professional coming from FC Liverpool was in operation at all seven League parties.
The middle field player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, who said Allegri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turiners and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes his name
Rapper Kanye West, with a particularly cruel appearance, gave attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" in the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for stairs and questionnaires with the audiences.

The pseudonym, however, is not a news.

"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Circular A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no hole for his disappointment.
This was a weak game of us today.
The enemy was simply more vigorous, we have almost never put him in trouble." Consequently, thinly, the list of Hoetmarer deposit options is read.
Grade two torchances in 90 minutes, so only rare games can be positive.
Football crystal A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwachenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first round, the first but used Maik Krause from angle to early lead (7.).
In the 43th minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-working by Krause, he turned free.
The hosts had only a double possibility as first Moritz Höne missed Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and found his master in Jan Blome's postcut in Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) forgave all.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the gate line with the hand and saw red - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stirred the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had been severely criticized before, that was then different today than in the last few weeks," was Florian Kraus's facility.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.

Football: Circular A2 Münster: spectacle football in Albania: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think about it," he ranked by words.
"We haven't got access to them." With that he probably said the wing song with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites that felt with collective offensive desire.
Yet, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, twisted freaky and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, was the relief that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Alba, plays the mastership and the other, Albersloh, fights for class content.
Understandably, with mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was by distance our best seasonal performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we keep on one of the top teams of the League over the entire game time, that was really phenomenal."
So bitterly, it seems that you now have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjicher Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th seasonal event (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he mustarded over the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can't stop completely.
"This was crazy what he had done," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent without jealousness.
Shortly before the change of page, his elf made the compensation: McGill's release from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through into the long toreck (45.).
After the page change, it was McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went somewhere.
It was a knocky, action-loaded game.
Nübel shocked albums again (64th), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was similar to (69th).
Despite abundance, Albersloh failed to reconvert the last Concordia match (80th).
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
"The game against Shapedettes, that's what we now have to win," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Frohning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone.

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-night.
However, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled to seek to get the tolerance price in Tutzing personally.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterward, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, Academy Director Udo Hahn acknowledged him as he proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in Tutzing Castle always appeared prominent, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual programme.
At the end of October, songmaker Constantin Wecker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Nowadays, France's President, Emmanuel Macron, also agreed: He wants to receive the "tolerance prize" given to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives TV moderner Dunja Hayali (who we reported).
The about 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is not sure!" says in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without a limit."
Waffnmentals, destruction, torture, death - the war insults every human idea."
From structural racism in society through the scissors between arm and empire to radical change in work by digitisation, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to look for solutions or at least for part solutions."
At a meeting for 200.
The birthday of Karl Marx is next to expect more visitors of capitalism criticism, others rather a tendency "from left outside to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We are 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said student director Dr. Ulrike Haendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
The musical cabal with Tina Teubner was suitable for both adults and men on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner had sex understanding, not only with humor and heartwarmness for the (feeled) woman and the (feeled) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set it in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben was seated in a sweep.
It is one of the male sparing partners, sometimes even to the end of the sentence, and one of them is a true pianist: so kingly accompanying Sükorv Teubner that some might have wished a solo.
That was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that is, as it fits to the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had put a paradoxon into the game: the satisfaction of the man comes if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not benefit.
The piano-Solo now demonstrates itself: What would come from the composition of Mozarts, "the Nannerl" would have opened the door inevitably?
Thus, Sükkrub glides over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a played dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers delivered Karlheinz Kleine, the lover of the association, the Chansonette.
However, the Chairman of Heidemarie Markenbeck was not allowed to take additional thanks.
She had the idea to get the Duo next to shows in Stuttgart and Frankfurt one in Wolbeck.

"I was really satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We haven't handled them," said ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more anxious about the many outstanding chances.
The concentration at the end made his crew miss this time.

Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the Volleyballers of the BSV East Bevern have re-established in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.

"This was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We have now worked on this," Trainer Dominik Münch rejoiced for a nearly blameless performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first passage almost dominated the guests according to popularity.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice champion of the year before at 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the two bar, but hasn't come into the game.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has put up with high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led with 12:8. "The adoption has changed to three bars.
We couldn't keep the replacement pressure.
Food has been sucking, and we've had a little bit of a drink," said Münch.
At 18:17, the fully ball girls from the ruhr area had their nose in front.
Although East Bevern defended four sentence balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.

International: Turkish municipality: Moschee opening as a missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great disib mosque was imposed in Cologne by the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The Moschee opening in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a bunch of sharing that can only be toughly reversed," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's redaction network.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, reconciliable appearance.
"To underline the belongingness of the Muslims to Germany with German top politicians, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," said Sofuoglu.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has strengthened many reservations.

On 18 October (Thursday) at 19.30 p.m., the home association Nottuln already organises its fifth notulner Volksträff in the chamber of the Old Office.
Almost on the day, it's then a year ago that we've been doing a referendum for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a permanent part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our genus was so fast bleeding in Nottuln eta.
Whether in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace of the office was always fully occupied.
"The program at the next referendum is like always a colorful mixture of German people-, hiking- and sailor songs, Folksongs, Evergreens and old slaughters," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friends of musicians to Nottuln.
On the first "Birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer promised with his accordeon.
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbouring circle of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish people band.
The people's makers remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Volksträff Emsdetten, with his international version of the song "Fruche in the night", enthusiasticed the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
"We expect many happy guests to spend a social and humorous evening again," says the invitation to the home association.
Whoever plays a instrument and wants to be active, is invited to join.

From pure fruit building to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the circuit association for gardening and country care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses were set for the circuit association for garden and country care Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbach City Hall on Saturday evening.
In 1893, he was raised from baptism by mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
The purpose of the fruit Building Association was also different from today's work - it was actually about fruit Building, about flowers and garden Building.
"On that time, in the epoch of the education, the fruit tree was a favorite son of the elites," said circuit home career Günter Dippold in his celebration lecture.
Fruit trees should seam remote roads, in schools so-called industrial gardens.
Obstan Building is still the task of the 55 Garden Building Associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprises nearly 7000 members.
But this does not exhaust the spectrum.
A natural garden construction, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition plays a similar role as the provision of knowledge, healthy diet and youth work.
The multitude of the fields of a garden construction unit, the members of the Hutschdorf Youth Group "Mulwürfe" showed entertainment at the stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary especially in the digital era," said the circuit chairman Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The caston collection was a huge cause for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with smartphone & co.
Schreckm promised to plant two trees with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are supposed to stand, the circuit association decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the particular importance of the garden construction units for the villages.
The circular association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern for many gardening associations in the rural area, also made circuit business leaders and experts Friedhelm Haun doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the circuit association, including the need for self-care after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was dosed.
In the late 50s, however, the garden of use has turned into a garage of decoration and living.
"The nature has been in existence, it has been before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, for the garden construction units, there are the incentives to not let down so that our home is beautiful and vital.
It also includes greeting the new citizens in our associations, the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif the successful festival, which was celebrated by the towers of the music association Thurnau.

The Head of Government also reminded that the monarchy opponent Larsen 2010 had occurred at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the sows of bones and light a concert with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" place such a description of the rocky live musical experience on Saturday night in the hall of the civil center of the shoe factory: Hardrock purely of three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No sign of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the environment - all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loud-stark the about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rocknight visible.
Already the "Tiger Bonesaw" Quartett with Frontmann and Guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince the concert standing even with the latest, unknown pieces of own springs and the next CD.
Before the stage, it is danced to play the band at a vocal and printing stage.
Although "addition" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
That hardrock is not the same as hardrock, shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on the bass and slagzeuger Kai Hölscher with its alternative, sometimes recalling sounds of classic rock in the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" comes to "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only the desired, very balladenous "Take Me Home" is deployed by changing melodic passages to the guitar-lasting rock riffs of the versatile songs.
However, since its foundation in 2005, the "The Ignition" Quartet has played a special degree of familiarity.
Full of agility the band presents its hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" has been documented with its appearances before a very large audience - recently in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China in 2017 - is obvious and unhearable.
Songer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also plays with the band at the only coverted song of the evening, "Word Up" from Cameo from the 80s, completely own accents.
To feel even more exposed sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann provides a rejoicing solo in the meantime, running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs genrely to a hardrock concert like this: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the mixing team's comments at the threeer concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" are about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of press air hammers, but is still clearly under the excessions of the "Wacken-Feitval", which "The Ignition" refers to on their website.
Ear debilitating 120 decibels in noise drive volumes, as used by the annual metal deck in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience does not have to do with this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang type have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone sauces and concerted with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead man at the Essen/Mülheim airport in a sailing aircraft accident
At Mülheim Airport/Essen, there was a fatal accident.
On a parking area at Mülheim Airport/Essen, a sailing aircraft crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the airport of Mülheim/Essen, there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
According to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a sailing aircraft was crashed at the fair parking at the airport.
The pilot died.
As the "WAZ" continues to report, if the aeroplane student had been on board alone, it is supposed to be a seater.
The plane has already been at the time of the accident at landing.
The crash station is only located near a seat on the airport site.
But a October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two ruhr district cities and directly on the journey to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a parking & ride offer at large events in the fair Food or the Gruga Hall in Food.
Trump says to Kim: "And then we loved"
The fact that the US President of North Korea, Kim, despite the nuclear crises, has been well-sened is not a mystery.
Now, however, Trump made his colleague a real declaration of love.
She also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married president of the United States has known to be a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
In the public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Before adherents in the United States of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half that old sprout of the Pjöngjang ruler dynasty, although it proves to be very tender in the rings around North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was hard, he too, and between us it went from time to time," said Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also brought political fruits: Trump pointed to the stop of all atomic and missile tests announced by Kim, even though critics still see little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - whether his martial threat signs are famous - does not seem to be more conscious of the US president.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they loved."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so inpresidial.
But he cares very little about this, declared Trump and then directed his point finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so simple to be present."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there pushing into this filled arena, but we would only have 200 people outside.
October fest locks many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospherely and at the top addicted by sun satisfied: Very varied and with a good shot of October Festflair, Baesweiler's town was poured out on Sunday.

Reserved refugees thanks to video from Libyan prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their disastrous conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video, allowing their salvation.
In July, the group had turned the recording into their cell in the coastal town of Sawija under life risk and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Migration Organisation (IOM).
The refugees were eventually fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe through the Mediterranean.
With the video, he took his own statement to life in danger.
One of his competitors was almost struck to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the conditions of arrest had been disastrous: "They hit us all with pipes and stocks."
They gave us nothing to eat. We had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are strangered in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been returned to their homeland this year by means of the programme, said the IOM speaker in the Western African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad conditions of arrest in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a help call by phone video.
International organisations have long been criticizing the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as human being unworthy.
The North African state, which is dominated to large parts of military, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the National School on Sunday afternoon to prepare her school for Monday, she was surprised by an interrupter.
At 16:50 the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front of the 1st floor, she saw a man fleeing immediately.
Only through a door, then through the roofterrace, and from there through a steak into the ground floor or the courtyard.
The teacher informed the police who took up the investigations.
Whether things have been stolen or money can not be said yet.

German had been caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central francs after he had caught the car from all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a grass and liberated the missing since the service evening, the police informed on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld said that, despite the cold nights and long time without care, the data were in good health condition.
He claimed to look forward to his home now.
The pensioner had been reported by his family as missing after he had not returned on Tuesday from a ride with his land car through the local pastures and fields.
Despite intensive search actions, the man had remained unclear for days.
Laschet admonishes the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) urged the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on his own information, to state of law in Turkey.
The relationships of the two countries are currently "overshadowed", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns particularly arrest waves, the freedom of the press and the freedom of religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalise in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that legal status is a very important requirement.
Laschet, according to his own details, also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Thereafter, Erdogan once again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a short term building in the airline of the Federal Defence Ministry at the Cologne Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place on the castle of Wahn - but that had been rejected by the castle owners from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to open the Ditib Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the construction.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the United States: North Korea demands disarmament
While President Trump is not tired of stressing the successes in the negotiations on denuclearisation of North Korea, the ostatic regime represents the conditions of necessity.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a meeting of Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has instructed the US Government at the UN General debate to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean penalty with its existing sanctions.
"The latest stop is therefore that the United States builds on force measures that are fatal for trust education," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and there is no way to defuse ourselves as the first," the North Korean headquarters conducted.
That criminal actions could force North Korea into the knees is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped his nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test, Ri emphasized.
However, from the U.S. page there were no "consistent reactions", the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country alone last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo urged the United Nations in recent days to take strictly into account the penalties.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met the dominant of North Korea, Kim Jong Un.
After the first Summit in Singapore, the president of the United States seeks a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will travel to Pjöngjang again for discussions about the end of the North Korean nuclear programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth event, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White ceiling and flower jewelry on the tables and a great buffet waited for the guests after the Harvest Thanksgiving Service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with beauty from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality for which the young people wanted to thank with food.
The start with the new facility was not exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembered.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were best prepared for the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: An electricity loss had put the huge, second-in-a-line refrigerator out of operation, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the beginning: although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and youths wanted to make it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Beter it can't make cooks," a visitor was impressed, while Hokkaido cucumber soup was served or guests were allowed to use cheese, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and adolescents put on their legs," stressed practitioner Frank Beckmann, while the magician Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art made amazements.
Jürgen Sator leaves the national board NRW of the table
From frustration about criticism from its own rows, the head of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, issued his posts in the National Association.
Sartor had become known all the way because the Essener table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had retired in July as vice chief of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The Head of the Tablen-Landess Association NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed to the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-term alternate alternate deputy.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can follow his step - there people have expressed themselves who didn't know exactly why the eater table does this."
But Sartor is still active for the eater table - "six days the week, there's nothing to change," said Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized criticism to colleagues of other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You can't follow the approach "without us starving the people in the city".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people do not hungry.
The Essener did not participate at a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's been told me too much sweet shame," he said.
There are all these social fusions that criticized me at that time.

Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund grew newly from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had intervened against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, a 0:2 residue, but was still 4:2 victory in the second half time.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compare with a double-ette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, which was exchanged by Favre in the 63th minute, with another double-ette in the final phase (86./94.) provided the glorious completion of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Against a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic before the break, the Stuttgarter had to fear in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unnoticed Goalie Ron-Robert targets factored a curiosous deposit owner who helped guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss Quartet Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a lead from the hand twice, finally played 2:2 and still waiting for an external victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1 with his second federal liaison.
At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann was a summerless, as well as the second match after an hour.

Alassanne Pléa is seen as a goal goat in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase coming from OGC Nice met for the third time in sequence and for the seventh time in the seventh duty game.
After seven rounds Gladbach is occupied with the fourth place.

Although Stuttgart's Defense Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert targets brought the Bremer back to the game by a curios embarked owner (68.), a quarter before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the abundantly acting Stuttgart back to the victory street.
Nürnberg decided the Duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team with Foulpenalty on course.
Macedonian vote on new state names
Today, in Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens agree on the change of their country's name to Northern Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades of swelling conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be resolved.
Because of its name-name northern province, Athens had insisted on a change in name and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become rapidly NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrics in U-Haft.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the marital entry into force for all, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-old friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, in Hamburg, the two gave a yes to them.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had said before the "picture" presentation.
"If we marry, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Friday fraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had been excited on June 30, 2017 with an angry appearance.
Thus, he had proclaimed for the subject of "punched" to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU).
"This was your Shabowski motif," he said in announcement to the accidental announcement of the DDR-Grenz opening by Günter Schabowski.

Garden day: 400 meters crushed crush
There was a lot of work before the members of the Civil Association of Childrenhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
For about 400 meters of hectare around the gardens of the inhabitants of the pepper house should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, about twelve supporters went to work.
"We do this to reduce the costs," explained the Chairman of the Civil Association Walter Schröer.
And there have been so many things.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but, fortunately, it's just a form.
Because already in the spring, the hills have been screwed.
The following breakfast at work has also been a long tradition.
"It's supposed to keep everyone at power," said Walter Schröer.

Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal for the finalisation of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old placed a perfect course on the Olympia trail on Sunday.

The Gauting Police Inspector refers to the first inbreak of this autumn in a single family house.
Fortunately, the killers failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is going to make use of interrupters again.
Thus the police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday the first inbreak attempt of this autumn.
The fact that it has remained at the single family house on the Kingswieser Street is due to the alarm system.
It started when the killers lay hand on Friday shortly before 20 p.m.
The interrupters realized that the inhabitants were not home.
But the alarm system seemed to surprise them so that they took the escape without prostitution.
Tips to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite bei Hertha: Collected by the reality: Bayern against Ajax demanded
The prediction is indispensable: the defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "not fall."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate facility for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small part of the new coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to rise to the largest autumn depth for the monniks.
"A week ago, you had the impression that we are indefeated.
Now we got a little reality," Thomas Müller found after the deserved 0:2-degradation at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction to the Champions-League-Duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us, he knows that this is really annoying us and we therefore give it to Tuesday gas.
For the first time for more than a year outwards, no own gate shot, as at the same time of the pre-season, two duty games in series without victory, lost the table leadership in the football federal liga first to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failure of Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-and-man-tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle sticks over the outside have delivered equally two blueauses within three days, as the last excessive Bayers are to be knocked.
"They who know the FC Bayern know that we do not like this and we will do everything so that we can be successful again," stressed Kovac.
Otherwise, he walked gently with his losers in his birth city and pushed his first defeat as Munchner Coach only on the re-defective dealing with chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless be the first intermediate factor in his duration before the national playpause - otherwise the sound would probably be sharpening.
So Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second king class event of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which was also sophisticated at the start of AEC Athens by 3:0.
"Now it's taken us in two games, but we're going to make our gates again," announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
Like after the lost pokalfinale against Eintracht Frankfurt, Joshua Kimmich Klarxt spoke at the same place.
The legal defendant acted in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think this is all a shame, we have to work it up again because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed just before departure from the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh playday of the previous game time, the Bayers were even with five counters behind Dortmund, which now, with a point of advance, took over the top again.
And in this way, Kimmich valued at least positively with an eyetwinker, that the public debate on the supposedly invisible Bayers has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Shooting Line: Özil-Causa: sharp attacks from Erdogan to Grindel
With serious allegations, Turkish President Erdogan proclaims an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the link line.
Now you want to create a new post.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the definition of the permanent issue Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish State President criticized the dealing with the ex-world champion in Germany in order to open the big Ditib Moschee in Cologne, the DFB-Chef defended the association line.
On the early Sunday morning, Özil's personally sharply attacked grindel announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration background in the U teams - that such a thing is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration agent.
At the same time, Grindel again explained that Erdogan is not for the values of football and DFB.
He had insisted on racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with sharp words.
Our born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in Domstadt.
Honestly, I could not disguise it as her president that our two young men who went up to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the WM affair, which was taken by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to stand before players in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm Migrant - that's not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for the return of Özil to the national team.
As a result, next to the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, are now called an additional integration representative.
"If a person without a migration background clearly influences society and football and says, "The topic is important, there we need to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our associations in places where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Out and Özil affair, he wants to reconsider the office as DFB president next year.
"I do my work and try to make her as good as it is," said Grindel.
Years build three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 and 13.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharines in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marital entry into force for all, the politician married his long-old friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the entry into force of the marriage for everyone, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-old friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, in Hamburg, the two gave a yes to them.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for them, Kahrs had said before the "picture" presentation.
If we get married, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Friday fraction and one of the speakers of the Seeheimer Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had been excited on June 30, 2017 with an angry appearance.
Thus, he had proclaimed for the subject of "punched" to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU).
"This was your Shabowski motif," he said in announcement to the accidental announcement of the DDR-Grenz opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, equal sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adopting law.
Reference started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the expected referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state began with tension.
Approximately 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
It consists of the same named northern province of the neighbouring Greece.

If the citizens agree with yes, they will also give the start shot for the West integration of their country.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and to discharge family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not alter the continuation of organs with explicit consent, underlines Swiss transplantation.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and to discharge family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available at death can be registered there.
Their wishes are then available in the event of Swiss transplantation.
The new procedure does not alter the continuation of organs, as in Germany, only with express consent, underlines Swiss transplantation.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card will be found at the decisive moment for possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the family does not know the desire of the dead.
"You then have to decide as a vice in the sense of the dead what is often very burdensome," always said.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible institutional donations on the hospital card, as the speaker of the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can register their wishes - per or opposite organ donation - there is not," she says.
Federal Minister for Health, Jens Spahn, has spoken for a new arrangement of the donation of the institutions.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be regarded as an organ donor unless he or his family or his family were contradicted.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old students are world champion in head account
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in the headquarters.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
On Sunday, Martina Flamme-Jasper informed the science museum Phaeno, the exhibition site of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greeting from Germany proved the third place.
The latest WM shareholder was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensionary from France, as head arrival judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Sachses) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants from the audience arrived with pocket calculators.
Wenzel's greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when billing.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
Overall 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greeting was already two years ago when 14-year-olds were in Bielefeld.
With concepts like super brain, genius or miracle son, organizers can little start loud.
"Heavy accounts can be trained," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even calculating competitions in stages.
For example, the square root draw of six digits includes the disciplines.
In terms of versatility, the candidates receive surprise tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here the Germans would also have good chances, said the main arbitrator.
Otherwise, Asians are often beneficial because in early children's headquarters they are learning more intensely and with other, effective methods.

Polare cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Mrs. Holle shakes out her beds in the west next week for the first time: Polare Cold Air reaches Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) the snowfall limit falls at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in tight valleys, it could snow down to about 1,000 meters at strong intensity, said it.
From Bregenzerwald to High Taurus, above 2,000 meters are expected to be 20 to 40 cm of new snow.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Tummelsee, Biel Height, Burnerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertouren, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winterly.
Farmers may start the annual knick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein's farmers may start with the annual kick care on Monday.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have been the landscape of the Forest Darm State for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and slopes are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retracting rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the manager of the Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living toes
The Knicks were established on the basis of a order of Danish King Christian VI, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein in 1766.
The "living toeen" were not only field limitation and bovine tune, but they also delivered firewood and bars to farmers for their workshops.
From that time, his name was also "Knick": "Knicking" of the axes made it possible to develop the dense, flooded boundaries.
Today, between the North Sea and the East Sea ranges about 45 000 kilometers of the hills and gives the image of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species as a reserve space.
In one kilometer Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and breast up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only fulfil the knick if it is maintained in the winter accordingly.
Otherwise, he embraces a light series of trees, which, besides the variety of species, also involves the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, it is only allowed to operate outside the breakdown period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian speaks about Situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami in the interview with the editorial Network Germany (RND):
Were you on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then, when I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
How is the situation now on the island?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can be imported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that all have been completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also spent other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are running on surrounding hills where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they do not have access to water and food.
Some stop in front of their homes, there are still rebels.
Because many food shops and also the tank stations are completely closed, people are partially stealing food and petrol.
The public service has gone completely down, the national government is helping.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partially running freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but it did not work before and we got information only via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people who do not know whether they live and where they stay because people were on their way to work, not at home during the earthquakes.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information about that?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions, which were not affected by tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they are running to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't a island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We usually know how we respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has crashed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI survey in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled hearings is very limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the high thin majority for the controversial judges Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set the detectives a deadline until Friday to clarify the suspicious incidents that are left over 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh's appeal accompanied by a cultural fight had been triggered on Friday.
Following an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer exposed rageful tirads against oppositional democracies, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Erzconservative Judge at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secured when sudden Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demands a FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends welcomed.
President Trump, who had still called the "decision" of the serious talks on Thursday, first held further attacks against the women and spoke, in contrast, of "happiness in the accident".
In this way, he said, the last doubts could be removed.
Later, Trump attacked the democracies sharply in an electoral environment, because they refused Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You have felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The ease on Schalke is large after the first seasonal victory.
Yet, against Mainz, the factor time also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - Nowadays Christian Heidel is known to be a huge pessimist in football games.
This was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our punishment room," said the Sports Board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
Finally, the royal blues had succeeded in bringing the nearly 1:0 against the Rheinhessen over the time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and expert.
It could actually have changed.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creation 11 of the team of Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In total, the first half time was good, both playful and pressing.", with increasing duration, the head seemed to have a role to play.
Do not really create a headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours," said Heidel, "If the crew was only half as nervous as I am on the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give this out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," said a creature who had no insignificant share with his headball event: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
But at the end only the victory counts.
The relief was evident throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the first phase and make a fireworks of it," said Schalkes Chiefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the crew and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageously, so we have to play games over 90 minutes
The largest manko of the afternoon: King Blue missed to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met the Latte twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been scared," said Tedesco, "you've already felt the fear a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scalker.
Fishbachau: Smoking pillar in the head tachtal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He has been followed repeatedly by Ernst Reiling and Lore Housechild.
"I have made it my job to get interesting people to graves for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Räkenfelder Meeting" - that association who cooperates in the orientation of the evening with the "Cultural Policy" Alliance.
El-Mafaalani goes very slowly into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaks of how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With a lot of geisty, handheld numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses to answer the question of a metaphor.
At a table, the German society, the first generation's migrants sit on the catent table.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to get to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the large table and now want to agree.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is important not whether you are politically or leftly aligned, but, "Is I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
At first rather behave, then the discussion round is going to be increasingly dominant.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, tells two teachers how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands, not on the stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on eye height.
Sociology professor does not urge his opinion, stressing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Maphalani.
Even during the following signature hour, he has been an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the Foyer, in intensive discussion in prepared Kurdish specialities.

Building in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 lands
The need is apparently huge: more than 100 stakeholders have purchased one of the lands in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening sold the first lands in the new construction area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick is informed of this.
In addition, the application phase has been completed for those 20 lands offering the municipality at more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Well 100 applications had been received, so Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" with regard to application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the Plieninger mayor, it is the goal to have drawn up the applicant list for the 20 lands until the end of the year and to present them to the municipality.
After that, the award can be made.
A total of 50 lands are created on the area in the south of Landsham for single and double houses and four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight living units each.
The explanation is now almost completed, the roads and pathways are to be assembled soon.
One single property and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 lands in the socially compatible model.
The two multi-familie houses of the municipality are to be built according to Frick as a remunerable living room.
Totally 16 houses supported by the Free State, income-oriented.
Space for 200 people
Gross estimates are created in the area of the new construction area Landsham-South housing for approximately 200 people.
Not only this: Now, beginning of October, according to Frick there, the start for the rebuilding of a children's day place.

Thus Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also at the bank
For the third time, Naldo doesn't thanks to the Domenico Tedesco at Schalke-Trainer.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in sequence, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great in many people if the almost two meters large Brazilian had spoken the fruit of the soul.
But after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05, as usual in the middle circle, the Schalker players gathered together and thanked Domenico Tedesco at all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all called the simpleness of Naldo, joined and said: "We have to thank you, coach!"
"This was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his new reserveist, had no grief.
Probably Naldo, who has been celebrated in the past season as the best shalker, knows that he has actually not been hit at the stop - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "last control".
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you very honestly," said Tedesco about the moment he had told Naldo that he was not in the first elf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the association," Tedesco justified the step.
Naldo has played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can go through now.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last took Naldo too.
And on which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself in the bank as an exemplary teamplayer.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry continued its valley journey compared to the euro area in August.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
In Europe, Austria still has the third best vote behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute informed on Monday its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the PMI of the euro zone grew by 1.1 to 45.1 points, yet the index is the 13th month in sequence under the mark of 50 counters, indicating growth.
In August, only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold with 50,9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index has reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley journey could mean that the worst was over," said Markit Economy Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - in the third quarter - remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in view: Export contracts in the euro area have no longer fallen as strong as since November 2011.
Companies therefore resigned the seventh month in a row of posts.
In China, industrial production also decreased more than initially in August.
The mood survey decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points at first.
The Index of Shopping Managers bases its figures on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in turnover, employment, storage and prices.
