A republic strategy to counteract the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter as a myth by confirming that the election fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by the flash.
In the United States, the lawyers of the Republicans have reported only 300 cases of election fraud in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative effect on the participation of the elections.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the implementation of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of the US governments have been proclaiming new laws since 2009 which have difficulties in the registration or initial process.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new republic representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of election law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the voters to present a photo card and evidence to the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for the premature voting duty, declare the right to register as a voter on the election day, and nationals agree to the election law for which a court act exists.
Before the 2006 elections, no US State has requested the voters to show a photo card.
Indiana was the first state of the state of the state of the state who has raised such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities have a hurry to extend this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they supported draft law in 34 states which forced the voters to show a photo card.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million elected persons have no light card issued by a government authority of their State.
In addition, five million new electors in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid in order to obtain the required identification.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low income in a proportional manner.
In fact, 25% of the Afro-Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required photo card.
This is still enough.
The students who are considered to be voters who give their voice more and more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo card issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state of the state for election requested evidence of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state of state that introduced such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws that call for the voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, republic lawyers in 2011 have promoted laws in eight states which have abolished the registration of voters on the election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general elections have contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new choosers in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislatures have adopted laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the period for the preliminary vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the voters who chose in advance were Afro-Americans, although they are only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites represented 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws which restrict the registration of the voters.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The United States General Attorney has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage partially.
For example, only 16 of the 34 state states have adopted laws which require the presentation of a photo map.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the election law.
The democratic critics are proclaiming the participatory nature of the laws adopted and viewing the influence of the results in the countries that are decisive for 2012 as a clear objective.
A report from the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the election board to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative effect on the participation of the elections.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer prior identification: should the test be carried out or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes mismatching results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger delay for the men already undecisive to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We have received the opinion of two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to provide clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that when monitoring after 12 years, the probability of the formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 years when you have a direct relative who has already been sick of prostate cancer.
In men of afro-American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer disease has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and other indolent.
The patient must be really understood the extent of the risk of his cancer disease by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect life quality in the long term, and in these cases it is rather decided to monitor the disease actively.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer have no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They are proposed to be monitored actively and to be treated in advance of the disease.
The criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who is not, are determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether it should be done or not.
In collaboration with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed a instrument to assess the benefits and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means of preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if all were to eat well and move sufficiently.
"If there were no smokers, this value would increase at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
The fight against tobacco dependency remains a priority for the Canadian cancer society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It harms people’s health strongly.
"Today there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian cancer society, overweight and adiposites also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-, grimm-darm-, mast-darm, food tubes, abdominal muscles and breast-feeding cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against cerebral cancer throughout life," he adds.
Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much amount, it increases the risk of disease in a wreck or mast tarm cancer.
Warts should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Laterly, the body cells can damage and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamin
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not at present firm.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found out the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preload.
"The execution of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of Higgs-Boson has thrilled a certain appearance last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, one believes that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "most false" explanation of nature and behaviour of the matter - but was not yet observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics convention in Kyoto, but data is still missing to be absolutely secure about it.
Still, let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, because it seems that there's only a small risk of deceiving, and let's look at what's going on.
There is a necessarily necessarily necessarily necessary law in this world, which means that two objects cannot be present at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strong as you will hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it appears that such a law also applies to it: the Pauli's rule of exclusion, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "Quant state", with this "state" largely consisting of some of their properties.
From this the physicians divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, called Fermione and gently obeying the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, a bad band of anarchists who aren't holy - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same time at the same place.
These Bosons, according to The Particle Adventure website, are divided into two groups by the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing): the Mesons we are not going to treat here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature are spreading and the Higgs Boson would be related somehow.
It must be stressed here, however, that these Bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boon of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of the electromagnetic force.
For if a particle is accelerated with an electric charge or the direction is changed, the electromagnetic field is "destructed" exactly in this place, in like a steam that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bostons "trailers of power".
Stabler Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "depressed" so that this Boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the ingredient must achieve very high energy, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be feared by a very large rock.
That is why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a paper would never hold by itself at the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as the photon, too) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research be "good", Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicians to examine all the differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are also many physicians who hope that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has great deficiencies because it does not provide an explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no.
By the way, in the early 60s, the laser pioneers did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the dead physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and the 1962 himself developed the first permanent stroke laser (the first were pumped) - already said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a laboratory.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
In 1969, for example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical work.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eyes" and has introduced it in 2009 the nobel price for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our life, but it means that you can never really know...
Palliative Care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on Death in Dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the heavier question of the end of life.
The debate must be reopened soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, there is still a lot to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to consider this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that injured him had left him a deadline of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at his home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the morning.
"It's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
At the table siting before a delicious lunch, he is willing to resign to be helped with dinner.
Courageously, he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to heal my diarrhoea because this is humiliating," he informs.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man pinches in standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning into the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"This depends on the ability of the person," he takes a step back, he finds.
For several people who work in the Palliative Care are believed to take place large events in the midst of these steps.
Patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage, they are no longer caught by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by embroidery".
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want any more in life," she says before she accepts a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy in the next few days.
At Victor-Gadbois home, you offer a group of voluntary body care and help at the food recording.
The Palliative Care is then used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11.700 inhabitants have a bed for the Palliative Care.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the desire, the death is granted a oral care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetes have no longer to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served Mr X a beer that died during the night.
Today morning his son will drown the beer to the feet of the dead.
"We also help family and patients," reports Nursing Director Nathalie Savard.
Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other.
Besides a 93 - year - old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and who is well supported by his head kisses, while he gets honored, a 36 - year - old man who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children dies in a tragic way after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients instructed to the home of Victor Gadbois are from their residence, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to Palliative Care, i.e. to a care that should help help patients suffer when the latter has reached the end stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois home and the family for home palliative care in the vast Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
Exactly this great lack of healthcare in Quebec ensures that several doctors specialized in Palliative care look forward to adopting a law on the regulation of death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since the month of October, a manifest in circulation has been signed by prominent personalities of Palliative Care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not capable enough to ensure that all rights to a high-quality palliative care are entitled before accepting to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients badly until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
The chances of survival by Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a disturbing chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'm going to stop the treatment, she replied to me that she regrets the fight, she told me.
But she had told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thanks to the nursing personnel for not taking place this wish after their pain has been mildened by a team of Palliative Care.
However, it must be clearly stated that the palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of Montreal, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often react to the terminal sedation, which goes on to sleep the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relieving will be more and more able to react to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not mildened say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want you to sleep me," but "I want my pain to be mildened."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandale large sizes in Quebec
Officials of the road construction agency, companies of the construction industry, monetary operators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unions and maffios are scattered.
A "industri" which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is breaking down since drastic measures have been taken," says Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Quebec and former Head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him due to an in-depth examination of the disturbances in connection with the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister had only agreed against.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribes of officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport had only saved a billion dollars to the contracts," because some were instinctive to obtain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to fall," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to show "the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit that was launched in 2011, with its troops of economic auditors, investigators and analysts of the government, also makes great efforts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau troop" who since 2009 has achieved the "channel cartel" of Montreal in the artificial emergence of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has conducted regular house searches and accused of fraud and corruption against municipal office carriers such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has retired from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected to have repeatedly received butterfly in the exchange of public orders.
Explicitly accused of engineers of the Montreal Street construction office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lastly, it has been excited by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for receiving public contracts.
For several years he has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary connected with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to province parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted to organising an illegal procurement for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channeling contracts whose costs were artificially charged by it
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribe money of $736,000 as a compensation for canal contracts whose costs he artificially expensed.
Other officials of the road construction agency have admitted that they were being fed by artificially blowing the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organiser of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget filling his boxes with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr Tremblay retired in early November, which led Montreal to a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Members of Montreal who was alarming.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the eastern part of the island, she rejected the sale of a municipal property from 2010 that was purchased for $5 million and re-saled for 1.6 million farmers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation, which is ultimately carried out, she says, "it draws to a thread that allows you to understand the functioning of the ant submigrated system to stop the evil and blame the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "powerful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need a detection unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on his part, notes that "officers have stolen several hundred million dollars," however, considers the role of "mandate carriers who are on the picture" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a share of 70% black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he laughs: "I was told that this was just a weak settlement of reality."
The government of Quebec suggests that donations to parties be limited to $100, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as the campaign expenditure are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the award of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international view of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau calls on those who are laughing about throwing a look in their own rear courtyard...
"PPSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of game every day.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In the football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparing training of INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have made progressive progress.
So you make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to carry out games very high levels.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the stomach and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti embraces respect for all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many titles with viewed associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a injury series.
The confidence he put in me is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're lying behind.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves for the eighthfinal in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play out the return of the eighthfinal as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make himself a long-term name.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG shall provide funds for the purpose of adopting concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to disappear this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry out the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We completed with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another crew, those of Montpellier, has achieved a even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux call the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us is expected.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something that you can suggest, this is certainly a frustrating thing.
You're wondering what the people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A crew will build up in time.
In the Champions League we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a association that has not been able to qualify for the eighthfinal since two seasons, and which has also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed in the play break with 15 points in advance!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good during the last season, were "boasted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To be so better that you're talking about a "Zlatan dependency".
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he was playing, he made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those around him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, also enables all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some time.
I've seen things that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teachings, and today we have to show an example of behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, is close to the players, and stimulates to victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does this forced unavoidable in Spain on 16 October (1:1) represent a start-up game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has taken advantage of all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without the bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as many times in these technologies, a political vision is viable: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monoples, leads to financial crisiss.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but can be converted to dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15.000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin reached a maximum of $30 (EUR 23) in June 2011, he fell five months later to $2 before he recovered to around $10 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to move forward in a video game that can be won or purchased by games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are collectors of the accounts, auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers at the same time.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the handled bitcoins are available in the account book of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This happens via a mathematical task launched on the computers, whereas the winner, which is a kind of temporary central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before the whole "hacked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay the same money for deceit twice very fast (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains without link, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million but can be divided up to a hundred million set, which leaves a certain play room...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the performance of calculation.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also reveals these deficiencies.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Wiizmann Institute in Israel analysed the accounts and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "mega-closure sale" was started.
"Three thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, who converted Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in dealers, and latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be photographed and detected by a telephone, Pierre Noizat assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to cover hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin continues, but 2013 could be a turnpoint," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also provides for the re-evaluation of the various risks considered today in the event of the success of this currency.
We've departed from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take the possession of its territory again, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders fleeing to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, as was at the time of the Soviet Union.
They want to defend their centuries and archaic traditions, even if they have joined Dschihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbekians and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local opposers, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The deduction of the French troops from the base point in Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with mantle trees financed by French loans, has been properly done.
The trucks and tanks overflyed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more input from the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overridden by war because of the battles of the various rebellious groups.
Their takeover was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved to date.
Former Mujaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war have come back to power in 2001.
They have transformed themselves into trademakers by enrolling the government's lands to sell them as a land of construction to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American subcontracting.
They have been in trial, and most of them have not been involved in the fights themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not consist of thiefs.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of American funds: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and his ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population is below 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the single parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
A army is now present.
Will the authorities under whose command they will stand be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already endeavoring to restore the military in the province that will be withdrawn from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identity should have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which has existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidial power from it.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially in the event of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, its country has dependent on foreign assistance since the 1950s and long ago.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional fabrics are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a 30-year-old country of war, state control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor was widespread that Afghanistan owned immense soil treasures.
This further enhances the impression that the Western countries were only on-site to authorize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper cream on-site, or without means of transport for exporting through the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations in the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French war troops was completed on 20 November.
The new collaboration agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: Girl and Junggymnasia, French Institute at Universitys, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous common work and actions for the repair of agriculture in thousands of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
These work, for which numerous local workers were needed, have helped to suppress the resurrection: water, wells, drinking water, forestry, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave back after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard in these more than 2000 metres high valleys.
In the message, thousands of written requests have been made for small agricultural projects by municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to liberate farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, what they would like to do in their own statements, it would be necessary to continue smaller, more well controlled and directly affected civil assistance to their benefit.
A Constitution with the breast tan in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided with regard to the Constitutional Declaration which temporarily gives him unlimited power than ever, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
A week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a preliminary, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal controversy.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "take the right with his feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to abstain from their project to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way of finding its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is obsolete throughout the country.
After confirmation in an interview with the American Week View Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
Especially the Egyptian people with this regression to an overhauled vote is put to an ultimate extent: "Anything you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power", the latter should suspectly end after the constitution was adopted.
Mostly 85 Islamist members of this Constitutional Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they rejected the view that they have not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity last morning, 11 persons, vice-presidents, were added in all haste.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
In addition, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed for prayer at the time, since some members of the body were of the opinion that the pendeluhr of the constitutional congregation was not exactly going.
The text that was adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2 which took all attention remains identical with that of the 1971 Constitution and says that "the principles of the Sharia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made it more strictly possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Shineness" responds to the liberals who only consider it a propaganda struggle.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done on other articles.
In particular, they have given Article 220 in the eye to the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing as "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The first signs of theocracy can be seen in this.
The fears of the Liberals are also devoted to the fact that the next director of this university is likely to be far less temperate than the current.
"Not a specific religious commitment can be recognized at the moment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, who have partly been trained in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work about the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
However, he admits, "that there may be a multi-definition in respect of Article 220, as the terms used are rejected from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamian jurisdiction, Nm. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised in how far civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the extensive powers it confers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the request of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not presented to Parliament, but to a national Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also informs their fears regarding the text that they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, highlights Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television yesterday evening, demonstrations are planned for today afternoon.
The professors of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of Sole
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and an unaffected nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Bend against the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It says that everyone who baths in this river receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the stilling of the storm and fishing.
Jesus appeared to his disciples here after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Faithful people are going on the path of suffering or crossing Jesus Christ (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossing place, the anointing stone and the grave of Jesus is located.
Here is the Christian view of the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew as a result of the tree from which the Cross was made for Jesus ’ crucifying.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place of the Jews - the clay walls, the remnants of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different religions there leave notes with wishes that then come true.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins by their own strength.
All others bring an air sailway to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height, the famous skiing area Hermon is located, where it draws numerous tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The shippers have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, it was claimed that pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
On just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting ones should have a visit.
Among these is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock caves in the Jewish desert, are stored and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exposures.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Al Basha bath, which offers several halls of ancient Turkish bathrooms with sculptures of the visitors and bathroom servants of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Relli Museum where you can admire images of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir stores.
The entry is free, and donations are fundamentally rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most important department is the monument for the children, built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars shine.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main refreshment areas of Israel are located on the Mediterranean coasts, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceans.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed during winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 °C and the air is warming up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing throughout the year.
Moreover, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swems without any problem on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors are here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing mucous, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczems, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and calm down nerves.
To touch the secrets of old age
These secrets contain the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolis and Mesopotamia was linked.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are glad to swallow through the narrow streets named by star marks.
Fortune shall be the legend according to all those who touch the walls in the street with their star mark.
In Jaffa you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusades.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In carefully restored theatre, concerts and opera are listed today.
Watchlist for Tourists
If you travel to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the journey is preferable to take in no euros, but in dollars that can simply be switched into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually come forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway railway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations connecting the suburb to the upper city.
Exactly, it is a underground sealway.
A drive within the city costs 6 shekels, which includes climbing for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be conducted in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public traffic rests.
And Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only cosque food is served, excluding swine meat, sea products, fish without shrubs and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Rather, you have the choice between different dishes with hammer and beef meat, soups and desserts (prepared with cocose milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, freed balls of purified beans and herbs (falafels) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no scattering dogs.
For this, there are many well-fooded cats who spread comfortably and unhealthy through the streets.
In the evening, they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like live places and don't say no to delicious.
Car rental costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 per mark (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance also costs $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Access cards for museums cost 30 shekels.
In Numbers
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventures and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparative period in 2010, before the abolition of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and civil lawyers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals already act with false certificates
Each year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families remaining in the home country.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each migrant of work, has to carry out a test certifying the knowledge of Russian language.
To date, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing economy and in retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will in the future become a duty for all guest workers.
In this respect, not only language tests, but also tests must be put into the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both receipt and prolongation of work permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian official language is.
Similarly, those who received their training certificates and diplomas prior to the destruction of the USSR in 1991 are excluded from this law.
Sense, problematics and the protection of rights
The total of the exams will be under the Egide of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Sankt Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can carry out tests in all cities; now more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, civil lawyers asked several times before the entry into force of the law in the press: what does it actually bring?
What changes does the requirement to provide language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, against speakers of the migration authority, it is to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many now talk about the protection of workers' rights," says the head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Immigrants face problems without vocational, educational, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will compel people with evil intents who will put him under the suggestion of help into a dark, tight Baracke, where he will endure with dozens of his months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home country, you will be promised one, and at arrival you will be deceived, get their passports taken off and do not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the head of the work migration of the Tajikistan migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't squeeze, boss!
Yet, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only able to control the language of the target country, but they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not as much as their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmen, Usbekians and Tajiks can also afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children but to buy them proper clothes, shoes and schools.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizen lawyers emphasize the following important aspects regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to discard the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Accession for Unauthorized"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, legalisation costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Huschkadamow comments to journalists.
"But don't protect any cost of false papers"
Already on the day when the law entered into force, it appeared that not only the registration documents of migrants can be false.
Some counterfeit certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by federal migration authorities.
The fake papers were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a work migrant three thousand rubles.
The most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption in order to avoid simply buying certifications, both officials and civil lawyers agree.
At the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time only that they will receive time for a language basis course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where there is no need for active communication with people.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to reinforce the arms law for private arms owners.
Thus, the authorities respond to the recent events: injured in shooting on weddings and seven dead at the Amokloop of the Moscow Jurist Dmitri Winogradow.
The police are trying to prohibit the carrying of non-death weapons in the public and to increase the age of possession of guns from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Law will be presented soon to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attracting the screws".
On the Internet an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of various arms organisations - demand that the authorities take away from "sinneless exacerbations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, expressed the criminal lawyer, Wasily Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the Statisticals of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the application of the registered weapons in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that reinforcement of the law for private arms owners of criminals will not prevent the use of criminals on the black market.
Today, according to the authors in Moscow, you can find every possible weapon for little money.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons come across several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Stack for 10 years.
Screenshot of a site that accepts weapon orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly by the police officers.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms camps.
Many military camps often experienced explosions.
"There are evidence that in some cases it was a firefire to hide the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
A contribution to the black market, according to Baranez, also contributes to the arms manufacturers.
"Today there are numerous private armor factories that do not stand up with international competition and therefore swallow the weapons under the hand on the black market, such as in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kirgisistan.
"There is a own, sometimes craftsmanufacturing and a maffia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
A report was written in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Ministry of State Statistics, Criminological Literature and public-accessible information on arms portals.
The main part of the illegal weapons comes from the detectives from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by "the guilt of responsible persons who have come to deal with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% are defending in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor of a weapons store, which does not want to be named, assured that weapons found at illegal excavations have long been buying nobody anymore because they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more frequent that dealers get the replacement in a weapon camp.
A gun, such as a gun of type TT, is bought over a fahnrich.
The gun is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"Of course, the police are aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crime, regularly carry out control purchases in traders offering illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"As in luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are most frequently found via acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested me to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales advisor. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are merchants on the markets, but there you have to go there and get along with a code like "of Ivan Ivanovich, who can tell that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am at the moment even getting to some slacks about a friend I trust.
He also delivers me the scraps just because he knows that I don't screw him.
New ones are looking for weapons on different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes did not change according to him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," remembers the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but I'm riding with the seller into the woods, and there we're setting up a target disc.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There is no need for any paper or personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says in the advertising ad on the website "Buy champion gun or gun".
There users give up your orders and make requests.
Are you also selling to minors?
"Of course without a license", the user asks "Iwan" (world quotation).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless shiny web sites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
The people come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and may swallow coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following schedule: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws are not applicable.
The responsibles accept the orders.
The buyer has the money over a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the commonly useful organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that eventually you can go out empty and come behind grids if you place an application on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless shiny web sites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and have the right to throw coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US dollars
In buying illegal guns, experts are expected to have prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow by the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarow for $100 to $300.
You have to wait for up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by supervisors of the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of crimes with illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States Fast Food and Supermarket Employees
Every fourth U.S. youth sits behind Mc Donald's cash.
In recent days, there have been massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food cats such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens.
No one yet can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon go back to the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several links-oriented publicly useful organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple walmart and fast food workers, the organisations of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
Until now, this industry of the economy is hardly organized in commerce.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handmen.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, lay down their work and discussed their work with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group of persons is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from winds over hunting guns and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are between 8 and 27% more favourable than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the product only so cheap because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of bars or hand scanners.
Participants of the protesters at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the own health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart colleague who deserves 9.5 US dollars the hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California in Berkeley show that if the company increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost $3.2 billion Walmart.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart would kill the wages totally to the customers, every purchase cost them only 46 cent more in the future.
This would be for them per year compared to today more expenditure of only $12.39.
Professors of Walmart satisfy that only nine states protested and did not save any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted in its shop from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart sold some 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart boxes carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, argued in an interview on the website of the left-handed Huffington Post that in total, "less than five" Walmart employees had deployed the work and the protest action was just "a further PR-trick" of the trade unions organized by the protests.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goals were not Walmart (which are not desirable in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you any sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York receive 8.90 US dollars the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it's possible to get out in New York with so little money, I can't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American youths after school at McDonald's were behind the theke, but the adolescents still lived with their parents.
Nearly one saw the main source of income in it or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with employees of McDonald's, I have constantly met people who regret that they have to come out with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests who began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cassiers and kitchens of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars the hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of businesses from standing in the way of this goal and reproving or dismissing trade unions members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were strong protests this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protest was a assembly on the afternoon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democratics spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrations were also supported by other prominent New York democracies, for example, Citizen Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support the fast-food employees so that they can gain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of their type in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundreds of people on the ground, of whom not all of them are occupied in the fast-food industry, in which they work in New York tens of thousands.
It is not yet possible to see if the radio of these protests will mobilise all the masses.
"To date, the brain can only be overlisted moderately"
The theme of extended reality, which is popular with supporters of modern technologies, is in recent times usually seen by the lens of a special glass.
First, in summer, Google presented a working model at his annual conference, then in November it became known that Microsoft had also registered a patent.
However, in conversation with the manager of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company's scientists.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with just hands and creating virtual surfaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group conducts.
- We are dealing with the interaction of human and machines, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has remained mostly in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to see for 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox Console and the Kinect sensors are progressive, and today, no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in movement control.
- What else will we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more takable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its surroundings are recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of this screwed Virtual Reality helmet!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overestimated?
- It is certainly not the solution of all purpose, since it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all the surroundings about its actions and intents.
Actually, every kind of interaction with computers is good, but each one in its specific necks.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project where we experimented with short and hard instead of with exhaustive gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically, it could be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
However, the future as a whole belongs to mixed control types, such as geist and language.
- How?
- For example, would we ask you to give you this spray?
They say it and simultaneously suggest it.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean, you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the respective time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we will have to work mainly on developing new sensor types that enable people to get more accurate responses.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What claims do you make based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little for gestures in particular.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with a regulatable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, where today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed a device just like this, without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Doesn't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared channel and the second one a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It is not intended for calculating the object depth.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, kinect-like system where we could play with different camera tendencies to find out how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember well, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the road, but I think the following: The most great variant would be a "changed" extended reality, where we could switch over a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality through the glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- For a moment, imagine that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She sees pressure outstandingly!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" some handfest, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams produces at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is at present but still so weak as if someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nervous ends in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overliste the brain?
It makes it think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely a person who is physically located in a closed room, to be believed he is in an open, practically infinite space instead; here we work on concepts with loopbands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
Until now, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and there are many working years ahead of us.
That is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to urban inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
The list already included high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success goes beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagante artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed barbecue, one of them at the Russian museum, the summer garden, the scene meetings or the vernises.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract great crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social philosophical artists who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and hefted by his presence on the street his fellow citizens a smile in their face and brings them good fun.
Recently, he took a rotor and became a Petersburger Drehorgel player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artistic behavior, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or Turkish in the city?
I chose the color Red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image advisers and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the grain worm produces aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newsky, where my work was exhibited.
I understood I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognised painters then ended, and new and free painters like me were ununderstandable.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, so with the representatives of Gazonewschina; of which "Puschkinskaja 10" was created, and then was only once finished.
It draws me to theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this united in your art clinic... it was important for me to stand at the centre of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artist club for the boheme, the house of Petersburg Bohemia, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how sneur with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wearing tight tricots and among them also belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin, who said today.
When the group began to play live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he learned with us.
The Gallery "D 137" or the club "Gribodov" also originates in the Art Clinic.
There our staff and ancestors went.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a press survey on the award of "the personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and that made me at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a human being of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognised style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the topic "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I was social in the past, but now it hurts and prepares fear to be like that.
In a clown, all of this is blurred and lost his tragedy.
I love the bigs, and I have big ideas.
For example, let us save the world by stating that everyone has to dress completely.
Everyone now watchs the clothes and orients themselves on the outer side and not on the inside of the man.
But maybe you can't give a man the hand, but you should sprinkle in his face.
The deceit disappears through the clothing.
We've recently seen you in the role of the city's rotor player, a cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if I don't?
- Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- Commercial art must be cautious, respectful and flattering today.
We see the destruction of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now each cult star has about 100 attendants.
- The acts of Stas Michailow come to several thousands!
- To him, abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there are less management, money, and everything goes to nothing.
I have attendants, and the most important thing is not to cheat on them and not destroy the achieved.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that even hung with a collector in a series of works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually arrive at the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something completely different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said to serve the culture.
But not each of them can deal with culture.
The real Zaren were different, because the Zaren may not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good consultants in Moscow at present.
In Petersburg, we have some experts, but they are locked up because they need higher level experts who correctly evaluate the first ones and free them.
Now only counts your own taste.
The same applies to the erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the Cultural Capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and an appropriate nutrition ground.
It's hard to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural nutrition soil, for example, for now we have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
There are many curious people in Europe who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the past century.
The project is financed from support from the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the universe
Earth in danger.
Thermal heating or collapsing with crochesteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthly inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question how we can continue to plant in the severity or on the replacement planet?
In my view, there are no many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could live at least hypotheticly.
"Precisely Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of the Venus exists a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in high height or in the cycle of the Venus, i.e. in the All.
The question of reproduction in All, the researchers first addressed the flora.
Even a half century before that, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of herbs grown in the Orbit did not at least differ from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of small fruitflies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, watchleaders were sent into the universe to investigate how gravity affects the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chicken must find stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chicks went wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn fell completely off.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chickens drop and then put it all in, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Wladimir Sychew for a failed experiment with the chickens in all.
The last cake with animals flooded 16 years ago into the courtyard.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" only will be equal sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized to the All.
In principle, there was nothing special in this regard.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," said Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats were grown up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals who are ripped out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproduction drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do that in principle.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
However, women have been flying to the All for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk in Terechkowa.
The most valuable humanity has is the female organism.
Our moves fled away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to life after this flight?
"Nobody finally answered this question," says the space veteran Ventang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkowa, was born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was two times in the orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, was born a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy adults.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying in the Orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the preparation centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
The cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.
The water is the severity.
Even though adults feel water pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Jagtyanders would testify that life on the land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is located about 9 months in the abdomen of the mother in the fertile water, and that it can be more accustomed to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just just two weeks.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while the severity is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and pelvis muscles rapidly decrease and thereby also decreases the ability to push the child out.
Well, let's take care of this by means of birth-introduction aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the non-significant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeletal and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in the orbit like an adult for training in a load suit.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment that we are conducting together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled person, a completely inappropriate human being," predicts the head of the Bioethic Commission of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe is just a theory.
But at some point it will be real when the earth's inhabitants in their spaceships break up into a remote planet, which will be the home for their offspring born in all.
NKU-Chef: Control of the black system fails by debts of politics
Czech Republic has good control facilities and adequate laws in the context of public orders, but does not apply them.
The Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Neivyší controlní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says this in the conversation for Aktuáln.cz.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be properly applied - and this is not the case with us," comments Kala on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he refers to the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system then prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then it can not simply come to the government chairman, and the control office whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law is obliged to obstacle to its activity," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Auditors of the Chamber of Members, you spoke of a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What was it specific?
This is a parallel test we started with about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is the fact that the European Legislative sets out how public orders should be carried out, which is based on national legislation, and eventually the actual practical application is still available.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the test has not yet been completed, we have been able to detect extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws may even be a bit "stricter and perfecter" in us, but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of law.
How can the project help you? What is the result for you from this project?
Exactly such a common control could help us to stop continually trying to perfect the laws and to reduce and interpret thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means to acquire a matter at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and exclude unlawful enrichment or even crime.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal too.
Perhaps it's even so that we only burden the system with excessive paper crap, and those who look for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech award law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a authority similar to our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant to the NKU is the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar to that of us and has a colleague that is just a little different, but in principle both authorities are working similarly.
The competences are also to a certain extent comparable, although Germany is a state of state, i.e. that these accounts are also available in each of the states - the German system is different from our.
The BRH may only control federal funds which correspond to our government funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting offices.
With regard to German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information, but in some respects Germany is often called a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the checkers are better there?
I don't think so, but as I said, I don't like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also facing problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything of collaboration with our authority, would they?
With regard to Czech legislation, what was the significance for your authority of the novelling of the award law, do you feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only a short time in force, it has not yet affected our tests.
Since our controls take place afterwards, there must be a certain delay here.
So far, we have experienced effects in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of inefficiency" and analysed and analysed with this nearly 14.000 public orders - here the changes will naturally affect as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tendering have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system in charge of further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hopes that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may be that the rules become "stricter" and cannot be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, those subject to an examination are responsible for the institution (e.g. in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to comply with any non-compliance with the award law with infringement of budgetary discipline.
But is it useful to make the law even more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let us say what way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not illuminate the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "Black System" - exactly what does that mean?
Is the black system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then it can not simply come to the government chairman, and the control office whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he can't say that we do this as if nothing would be.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what we think is missing.
On the streets there is a single ice slide, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic, there is partially snow and ice smoothness.
However, the roads are mostly well travelable, sometimes increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well travelable this morning, with snow and ice sleeve.
The temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 °C, it should become slightly warmer over the day.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the deeper hills it remains just a thin sneak.
However, the rooms of the iron mountain are approximately 30 cm of snow.
According to the District Street Guard ruled restricted views.
The R6 fast road and the first road class in the region are currently unlimited.
For example, attention is given to bridges on which the railways are sometimes required and smooth.
Similarly, all roadways of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, can be operated.
However, on these streets the snowest is required or departureed.
In particular in the higher layers, there is therefore increased attention.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets Ostböhmens is threatened by ice glow, higher layers and in the mountains is sometimes located on the streets, while the road and motorway direction is informed on their websites.
The road championships warn drivers against ice smoothness, which can occur in particular in higher levels in the pardubice district.
It can be used for ice smoothing in the circles of Lanškroun, Ustí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto, especially on roads of the second and third road class.
The streets I/43 and I/34 for Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the giant mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
A rainy snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
It is mainly sunny or hotter today in East Bohemia, and it remains largely defeatless.
The temperatures are between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Arrows County
The streets in the Pilsen district are well travelable today, but local attention is offered, and the route should be adjusted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures then fell, it can get to ice smooth on the streets.
It is also expected to be fog locally, but the view will be improved during the day.
This information comes from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, but increased attention, however, recommends the road championships between the 80th and 131st kilometers.
The roadways of the first class of roads are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smooth can be cut off.
The roadways of the second and third road class are moist and therefore the reference to possible required sections shall also apply here.
drivers should be particularly cautious in the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
County Olomouc
With Schtagach, drivers today have to expect to go towards the heights in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of freight vehicles, Schtagenach stays on the Pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow drying forced the road masteries to use, in the Šumperk circuit, according to the road management information, some 3 cm new snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the railways are mostly unlimited.
"In the circle of Šumperk remains the most snowly in the heights.
On the passport Červenohorské sedlo the drivers must expect to go towards Jeseník with Schtagenach," said a street manager Šumperk today to the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the circuit of Jeseník also had to go out in the night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet up to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimitedly accessible, but in the Šternberk circle, drivers must be carefully driving in forest sections, since the railways are still moist.
Ústí nad Labem County, Liberec County
In northern Bohemia, road masteries report a number of badly transportable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smooth, the mountain road is locked from Telnice to Knínice in the Ustí n.K. circuit according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper layers below zero, so snow and ice will stay on the streets. From the depths, especially southeast of the Bohemian Mediterranean mountains, no problems are reported, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disorders have been reported so far.
Ice slide is reported in particular from the Štětí circuit.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - every day rain and melting snow, in the night of cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes and from the road I/13 at the border of the district Ústí n.L. and Liberec, bad conditions of transport are reported.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required because of axes that were pressed from the snow load to the railway.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think about taking place in less than a month of world decay?
This is one of the disaster reports that we are so happy to come to.
With our tap tap tap, we're rather funny about it and say that we're the only band of the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's underground.
In December you will also realise a unique project with three concerts against the world’s decline.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a country-wide beneficiary event that we have planned for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will be held in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be at about the time at which the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphician Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the decline in the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the condition in which we give this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world's end, whose purchase via www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap tap, along with other artists, has also recorded the sog. Hymne against the world’s decline with the title "World Decline falls out".
Already today, the hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also come to the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, at the end, provided that everything works and the decline of the world doesn't take place...
The hymne is intended to be sung by all artists at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transferred lively in a direct switch from Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sing with...
How did you get to collaboration with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech Culture scene, which is related to realising many beneficiary events and concerts...
We are trying to intensify these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the reimbursement of the concerts against the decline of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, at which we have been working six years with the Association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with different recreational activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the practitioners, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we are supposed to build a own building in which we will then move with this project.
Several groups and artists appear at each concert.
What criteria did you choose these?
We wanted to make up a program that all generations, including children, call.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý occurs in Prague.
More information is available on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we are presenting at Prague spring for the first time, and we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year, we would like to appear in the Czech house in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would like to link this to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans have not been very small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organically?
It's not as bad as it appears at the first look.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, of course, we have to drag many instrument bags and other baggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us to have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison of how it looks in individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were witnesses in Russia that in the east everything is still in its beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual if someone is on the road in the wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even obvious there that you leave a wheelchair driver in elevator, for example.
Happyly, there are also associations there who are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we have to collect toward the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation depends always on the efforts of the stakeholders.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public room, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not usually that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead with the Band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our range, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to establish a band?
At that time I began as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I am a musician myself, including Saxofon, I founded a music-AG with a colleague.
Now, and with time, as our moderner, Lária Anlovič, uses to say, something is going out of control (laughing).
But the band has only been known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that collaboration with known singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and do not see it outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funds, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment, and so on.
Was it your goal to take it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can handle things differently.
In the show business today, one of them often copies to the other.
This is logical in his way, since everything new is considered with caution and is only accepted after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
The first impression that the spectator has mostly is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely excessive because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for all society.
Was it helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also ask for a certain discipline.
This is, however, quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have samples twice a week, have to finish preparatory phases, and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm ends with many fast.
But this is how it works everywhere in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá州a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join is always welcome to us.
Does take place on the day before the predicted world decline, Thursday 20 December 2012 at 21 a.m.
Event locations are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three events are finally connected by live showing and there is a joint interpretation of the hymne "World Decline falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to provide the funds for providing a multifunctional disabled education centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was registered as the twentieth member of this space authority at a meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA Ministerial Council. Poland is thus the second member of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and took part in several ESA projects in the following years.
The road of Poland into the space was evidently started much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasms engaged in space, not always on understanding.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warschauer Observatory, where the author presented thoughts of his pioneer work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 the Prix REP-Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognised contribution to the development of space, among other things, was appreciated by the name of one of the craters on the earthly side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway route was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or brake the draisine.
This information comes only from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missiles.
The research was conducted by the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents delivered show that research has been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
The research was then clearly interrupted by the invasion of the German Army.
In 1937, in the special press of the design of a photoelectric hunting drake appeared, the "Raketa - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared in the following year.
Both projects focused on the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the transient Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komité Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space society.
At the time there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was expected that the research of the space would have a future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Polish space society PTA tried to join the International Space Federation established in 1951, and the PTA became a ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation for Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA took a major part in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Raketa Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The missile with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh a total of 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests started with the two-level RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further development level should already be able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was stopped.
Follower of the first type RM rocket was the meteor-1 rocket developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-level missile, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this missile, which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A missile has a transport room of 0.4 litres of capacity, meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the meteor 2 missile was developed in the aviation institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg use load to a height of approximately 60 km.
Afterwards, the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Republic of Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on public work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on public work.
This decision prompted a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final effect, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with loose financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (loans) there are price tensions.
Under this term, a condition is to be understood in which the manufacturer is attempting to consist in economic competition by importing favourable goods by "inviting" competition in order to increase its market share and increase its profit.
In large scale, this means that most companies move their production to abroad or purchase them in favour, or quit their business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with similar high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is still strengthened by the absolute unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay their taxes and thereby replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are excessive in this place.
The unreasonable practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments provide their own population with private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to the laws in force.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital in particular in the field of wages.
This is done by economic force in the case of long-term unemployment, and by circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
For a few years, in Germany there have been public food tax offices for arms who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of persons concerned is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase their income until the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The spare measures will undoubtedly go beyond the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as was in the 19th century) under the pressure of a disastrous disaster of their social level, or for a hunger wage at the edge of society and hope that private investment capital will sometime flow into the country.
Here, of course, is the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty is wandering from one country to another; or capital remains out of the way, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa the employees are working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State may not participate in its own economy with capital and that plan economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is closely maintained in its view that the State cannot intervene in the economy in a direct manner.
But then you have to wonder whether private capital does not affect policy and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even directs it.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically almighty and present lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual distribution, legislation, in which practically everything is tough but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a Ministry of State does not have financial resources in private, close to industry, instruct legal undertakings to develop draft laws.
These draft laws will then be adopted on the Bundestag.
All violence is then no longer used by the people, as the Western Constitutions proclaim, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are currently getting into a situation as they described in their work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesar and Pompeius' time: "The State has long been understood in destruction, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against measuring money, by illegal relief of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew without inhibition, and the people went to election with already bought voices" ... "People with character did not complain for officials, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "There was really started to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole rule, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, who replaced democracy permanently by sole rule.
As it appears, today's society, as well as in ancient times, is based on the unrespected preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to social interests.
The private capital has not been able to recognize and implement the benefit of the entire society from its nature.
The result, as was today, is an unprecedented decade of elites, who are not at least trying to make deep reforms.
The cause of fascism and communism, therefore, must be searched for in the unrespected liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's point of view, the destruction of this regime in favour of liberal democracies can be considered a certain break when the next round is already in place.
Especially disastrous is the fact that today's elites are faced with the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human life in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know from older and newer history, in perfect ignorance.
The abolition of the law on public work is not a solution here, at least no permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopole position of private capital in the society in favour of the State.
Israel: The laboratory of the chaos.
"... that nothing comes from violence or ever occurs" Sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in Refrain is: "...so we don't forget how broken we are" .
"If my sons didn't want war, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as always, there was a number of reactions.
The ones stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed to the Palestinian Arabs and declare the state of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write in this place about who is born in this ever-recovering wave of the killer and who is victims; in the end, the people of Israel today, including the self-administration areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about opening the readers the look behind the scenes, looking at whose 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot land in the Middle East is especially desirable.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them, and from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly affects the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the fight for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less evident is the question of whether it were really always those personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is focused on less individuals and that this concentration of money and its resulting power did not develop within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, a special producing that could be called the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone is above them, but I don't exclude this) - the Redhschilds.
A lot is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the 1990s of the 19th century to prevent the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in the background of which the strength of their power, the growth of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are conducting wars or resting on them ( prior to the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis, only four remained, while Russia in the meantime undersigned its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, started during the Civil War, publishing own (speaking: state) banknotes and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to release his own banknotes and wanted to remove the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to accuse the FED for the trigger of the world economy crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschilds led to the formation of a plan for the defence of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemaurer of 33, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed at eliminating the great monarchist state creatures of Europe, in particular the second war would break the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (a such number would provide their comforts and luxury and would not also consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecomenism is here nothing more than the premise) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening the situation (see the foundation of the FED, in order not to repeat crisiss such as those caused by them in 1907).
After the murder of Habsburger throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Zarian Empire by the revolution of the Bolshews.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economicly unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarian Empire was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Ungarn took place.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politics to create a latent conflict situation by placing Germany with huge war repairs, thus creating the condition of poorer masses, so that they had to underjoy the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, offering the debtors named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-population state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should take into account the function of a fifth column and also take into account to eliminate the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, where a branch aimed at the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first contradictions with the inhabited Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was loose from the chain where the international bankers had held him at the beginning or whether everything went by plan, it is hard to estimate, at least the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state through the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war repairs against Germany for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed in exposing this war, the Jewish people will be a victim in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, as in the Second World War.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (only think of how sharply people are divided into Israel’s adherents and opponents).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only triggers in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are electing only their own candidates.
The present Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism sensitive politician who loyally devoted to international bankers, who is doing everything to develop a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai organization of cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and in which it could come to a destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control over the only two miles wide road of Hormus, over which 20% of the world's earth's destruction.
In what light do the words of David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a wholesome crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocracies.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the young and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one can buy or sell, because he has the sign, name of the animal or number of his name.
Here is wisdom, whoever has understanding, who considers the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty."
The film Argo: If it's the worst to call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. message in Teheran and took 52 diplomas as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the crashed shake Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had maintained the patron over decades over his regime.
For the US government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shark overboard, since this would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to carry out the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution was in place in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe struggle for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasko in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made everything worse.
The diplomas captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been delivered by the Algerian Government.
The fate of the hostages at home proclaimed a wave of solidarity and anti-Irish moods.
The Debakel in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story that declared a small partial victory to the United States.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six messengers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian paces as members of a film staff that claimed to visit Drehorte in the country for a science-fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required cooperation with Hollywood.
In order to become credible, articles about this film project appeared in special magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic polythriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
Thus, in the film, the atmosphere changes – on the one hand the Tehran documentary scenes (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographies are shown, and there are no major differences in filming the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and easily overspot.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office flours, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
From a laughing actor, he has become a respectable director, and as a actor he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third playfilm after the Krimi No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play at the director's home Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place was among the features that the previous films of this director removed from the standard Hollywoods.
Avfleck, however, demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the movie play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the incoming sequence of the first storming of the message is very impressive in their perspective, yet giving the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect also achieves affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the false film stack on a base in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to consider that history actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the film.
But with the few he works quite successful, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always work so elegantly (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Teheran is turned off by a telephone in America, or also the persecution hunting on the startway seems a little.
The weakness of Argo is its too widespread spread, which is due to the need to show too much of action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and so they are far not alone in the movie.
Afflecks film thus loses a bit of tractive power. It is a film that you can follow with some interest and in doing the design and the retro style to a thriller remembering in the 70s.
However, enthusiasm makes it hard to wake up.
However, as a reminder of a certainly living piece of history and as evidence of how far the ideas of the almighty and all-knowledgeing secret services are, it is sufficient.
Directives for the blow-up of air balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year proclaimed an inquiry on the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to organize the competition "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies" said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of this survey, compared to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the European Court of Justice judgment on the harmonization of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Other incredible incidences from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013," next announced.
Among the controversial EU Regulations include the binding immigration of bioethanol on fuels which are naturally harmful, and also the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or also the Directive on the size of chickens, which became significantly expensive this year.
In the past, criticism also harvested the factual prohibition of the use of the term "supplier" or also the ban on the sale of traditional glue bears.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparat often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are generally represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, Czech Republic is currently trying to implement the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests also stated that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and do not have "crumbling anomalies".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that they only harmonize the unanimous national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to the waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation of last year, which, according to air balloons, has to be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age should not blow up the balloon without an adult’s supervision.
The EU was referring to an American study which, according to airballons, is the leading cause of child-infection.
Similar restrictions are already applicable to children up to 14 years of age in the use of annual market streets.
There are couriosis incidences at home too
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - everyone who performs an official function in the EU - must not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Formal Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, in addition to the etc. absurdities, the EU Regulation on the scope of food stocks in a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum amount of food stocks allowed on the day of our accession to the European Union in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for fungi preserves, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organisations of the survey were also impressed with the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or from the idea of granting funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were obviously not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for refunds in the EU in the autumn of 2004", explained the former Minister for Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As an argument, he argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state camps were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros according to Pala.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender on the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funds for applications for funds offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US EU), which should be specifically funds for the establishment of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exceptions
However, regulations in the Member States are easy to identify the objective of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, and thus also the effectiveness and development of the European Union throughout, some experts believe that they are more acknowledged.
According to these experts, a more serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions also emphasize the fact that Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tharžky", the domestic space (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition has reached back to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemák".
The name ‘Room’ may only be used for products of sugar tube distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world-famous cheese feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the Parmaschinken are now also the Karlsbader Zwieback, carps from Pohořelice and Třebo, or also the Saazer Hope.
With a EU brand, the pardubicer can breast cakes or the Hořic rolls.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you come to the idea of appelling to the President's office?
It's not about being a Senator or President.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I wouldn't be candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are increasing taxes and pension ages.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am over 40 years old, independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than to candidate for the office of a senator or President.
In the Senate you made it and then made yourself straight on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I've told myself all the time that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that if I was elected to be a senator, I would be candidate for the President's office.
My goal, however, is not the function. The function is a instrument that I can realise my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a strongest mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as people squeeze in the trap and in front of the TV, but that we are going to squeeze everyone who wants to change something.
This includes the media who want to rob you of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom of freedom.
For example, about me, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the castle you have taken with the These of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive asset statements of over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make proposals for law.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I resorted to keep the traveller a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the small spirit policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partylesser, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without drawers and party dogs from each party.
Do you see yourself as a human in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people see me more left.
For me, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move on.
I am not about whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to associate people.
I always support publicly any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You don't like it if someone calls you popularists.
But don't you confirm this by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
This can be called popularism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you're just keeping labels.
And that's not what you're going to do in politics on the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to the people for a long enough time, you will succeed, for example, in implementing material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to put them on our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the Presidents of Parliament's Parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the respondents would then have to say why they refuse this.
A strong personality pointing to misfortune may exert pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct choice of the President who was a deserve of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and have tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
It sounds like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I do not reach anything alone; therefore I have spoken with several well-known personalities about whether they do not want to candidate for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who rejected work overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in the trade in light heat oil.
I started my candidateship with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not at all come to the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayor and district heads.
Do you think about the establishment of a own party?
I have not thought about this yet, because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member and have not even the money for it.
I don't even have money for the president's campaign; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was, by the way, a children's dream - James Bond always liked the way he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You're driving an aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do you want me to make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program is not too interesting.
And I am not obliged to dispute the campaign from my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live of the senator content alone; I could not, for example, finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I wouldn't make anything for anything.
So do you continue working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to drive these activities back?
But this is not related to the height of the salary.
As promised, I partially retreated my activities.
For example, my alternate representative will be director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
However, as President, I would put my business to my full.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of spikes and the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
"I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large company, says, "But, it's beautiful already, the house."
But I wonder what we need to do today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human being goes to one of these old-style libraries today, isn't it?
Spices, a small-sighted sleeping city in front of Rotterdam's gates, are a special record holder.
The 80 000 inhabitants community has the lowest educational rate of the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to rebuild the seven fictive bridges represented on the Euroscheins as beautifully pinned steel concrete thumbnails.
The success of the educational offensive remained in limits.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the statistics master: a library must come!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam's architectural office MVRDV, master of the magnificent bar charts and producer of funny, even cynic buildings, took the matter with common quietness and appeared to competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury was still consumed to look around and touched with the axles, the foolish Maas stabbed his exposed medal of size after a pyramid and ended his actionistly understood speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros expensive mountain was thrown up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November the Bookberg was awarded with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town retorts, which had no longer to offer to date than a post-modern footing zone and an unconscious, terrible city house, behind whose white facades you would be inclined to suspect a molecule factory to a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all spikes now have the first public culture building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheeseeglocks.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain massive, the true space and leather excitement occur when climbing the topography.
The glazed interior is bright and transparent, the burned clinker floor and the elegant road latches speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already have a look at park bank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Usually, the books are standing along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and inappropriate," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on our head and scrubbed the reading range from inside to outside.
The inside of the bookberg is well used: In the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology centre.
A special joy are the black book shelves, which are once wall clothing, once rearing, sometimes step lands.
Optics, Haptics and smell are strange.
Even carved architects and construction engineers shake their heads if the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the town community of Spijkeness, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a freeland farm, we have found a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter thin plastic is used as a root material in the Netherlands in growing houses and on fields.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's mature for the locker.
For the library, the fibre - for the first time in this quantity - was pressed to four centimeters of thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agriculture plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit for new cars and a bit for sports shoes.
After 105 stages, you reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long hiking, the literature café is rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and baptized ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but especially the proper humidity in the literature mountains.
Contributions to the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass areas, is a preliminary project in point ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and chilled with earth heat.
Although the Bookberg is under a glass crash, the sun itself seems only shortly inside on sunny days.
The broad wooden limb banders, which stand across to the glass barrel, serve as a shade and capture a large part of the solar radiation.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest do full-automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, was already voting the way to the new booklet.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even denotes the Bookenberg as the Spikeness of the "last overwhelmed soul".
The reason: To open up a few weeks ago, each inhabitant was invited to donate a book from its personal stock.
This is intended to fill first the optical gaps in the library that is not yet fully covered - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says the architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just a decoration.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the king's discipline called in the jargon identity foundation.
Spices have written literature history.
As young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach for identity.
Szabo: "German has to play a bigger role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the adoption of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S. relations, Berlin balances in a smal diplomatic degree.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signaled that it would vote against the application for a observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin was contained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical to Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the voice of setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by the NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to have a clear position in important international topics?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy and is going away from a policy that has been so-called managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to add that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are thus found between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean, then specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests which are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position of the Eastern Conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be cautious not to kick the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
This is in any case a matter of concern.
But I wouldn't like to add too much weight to it, that is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, it plays an important role in German thoughts.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important votes, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was a so dramatic fraction as in the Libya question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that it has to be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, made clear for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama in secret has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences in opinion are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so excited about Netanjahus politics.
Does Germany find it difficult to agree on the one hand with Israel and the United States and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
They're doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to take a major role at all?
Or does Germany still find the role of leadership difficult?
Germany is not used to this, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Eurocrisis, every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the US's influence in European politics continues to decline, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if it doesn't like them, it's unpleasant and makes them much unfavourable - c'est la vie!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani become Chinese sudden
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
In the light of this, an officially registered name in China hides, however, which has nothing to do with the company of origin.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual namegivers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It becomes more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the Kanzlei Taylor Wessing, specialized in infringements of law in Fernost.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
This is how Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you let Prada-Kny be registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations from the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company allowed to protect the trademark Segna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the Ermenegildo Segna fashion house.
The fact that the Chinese world masters are in copying and in injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multiple shopping houses that sell almost exclusively counterfeitings.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he is taking the action that Chinese companies are officially given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a bike mark.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is diluted, the sole setting disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and process costs of the sectors concerned fall into the millions, especially in the case of expensive pre-visible products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest luxury market and the fastest growing.
But deletion of dubios entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure may move, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration of the claimed name became the "market triality".
If the complainant has a problem, he even has to pay money to the Plagiator because he hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes here the law of the jungle rules.
Famous cases also concern graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, which recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese may use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was justified, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against the imitation of Hong Kong and Singapore, which made the famous crocodil look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt.
Although the CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there has been patches there in 2010 because of low staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, one was returned from the "Not situation in the course of work to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed objections was decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 objections are still awaiting in the office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were received in the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and indicates that China is the tenth time in conjunction with the list of new applications throughout the world, the Authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan was charged.
Simplified, this means that every registration costs on average 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, a multiplier costs, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the group has fought against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated parts of motor vehicles was removed.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.
It has been missed, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO also rejected the objection of the Münchners.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the process continues to fight until today.
You need to watch for herself
The matter is now in charge of the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly counted, the corporate archive had even had to look through a hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg on the other side was in vain offering a "high six-digit euro amount" to be added.
"It's how much it's worth for us," Wentzler says.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to drop back to Europe.
Then, if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long abandoned the group, yet it was able to stop registering.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but, as Wentzler says, the foreigners should "notify everything that is somewhat protective, even in China".
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay license fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment.
World Aid Day: Stamps, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS-waisen are excited about it.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, the stumping is cowboystiefel, basketball shoes, lady pumps and Lord's lipper looking for the tachy on the parket floor, finding it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then first, the voices of the singers slowly swallow up - old, bass, tenor and sopran - suffocate, deceive and persecute themselves.
And Fief Hopf, the 29-year-old Dirigent, almost puts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his arouse wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi proofs a new song.
The fifty singers came from 23 to 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir has a different text and it is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Assistance to self-help
There are about 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which estimates unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS babies live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa Paten has been found in Germany.
70 of them attend a continuing school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means on Zulu storytellers or also commendators.
The Bantu language fluently speaks can no one in this room, but sing.
For nearly ten years, the choir songs have been practicing in this foreign soft language and bring them back from time to time, where they originally came from: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, northwest of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, depending on the voice power of the German choir.
Fourty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple sleeve and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore, because they have been committed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, it is very small to see where the whole Swaziland is sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to Unicef.
Crops of male prehuid, which provely reduce the risk of inflammation by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus into themselves, to die with mid-30 is not rare.
On a common African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply on everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment to individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him to have a warm meal on the day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally looking after the AIDS agents in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmittable infections
What are the most important sexually transmittable diseases?
The bacterial STI includes syphilis, chlamydiene and tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappilomavirs, herpes genitalism or hepatitis.
Fills and crates are part of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and Tripper are particularly affected by men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydiene infections, trichomonads, candidose, trippers and human pappilomavirs are commonly sexually transmittable diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet about 20 percent of HIV new infections are the result of this group.
Chlamydiene infections occur far more frequently among youths than in other populations.
After European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, human pappilomavirs are common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmittable diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, the number of Syphilis infections has increased more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases may cause genital ulcers, urinary disorders, flushing, subcutaneous pain, blisters or wars.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of inflammation but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
Because some of the ingredients of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by measuring infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and avoid subsequent consequences.
Through patents, donations, and not least the gagens that the choir sing throughout Germany, there are a lot of things together.
"Totally we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the United Nations.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and enforcement strong woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans come well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as named the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans with them, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear in time every day for school class.
Whoever has no more comes to the protective house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a school for nesting, built two chicken houses and organized with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not natural, because as obviously the disease is throughout the country, it is most likely to be silently dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would exist at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels every two, three years together through the south of Africa and sing songs with sorrow, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many still know at the southern peak of the black continent from times of apartity.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but also has already triggered some wretched border soldiers a few tears.
The journey is always going to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their patriots.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," the people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the sample room at the Bergheimer Straße, you see it also shine.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Merkur
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cap may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although he is next to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as three studies published on Thursday in the scientific magazine "Science".
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanently lying area of the planet.
This is intended to be at least 30 cm and may even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that were beaten on the Merkur.
But no one linkes the find of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger sound, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Merkur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, findings could help to clarify how water and other building stones of life came to other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, sins, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to earth: Little glue holes into infinite pastures.
The picture comes from a camera that German researchers have developed from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, including the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who cries behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is not "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomic Union of 2006.
This section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of uncounted star generations: the oldest stars are recognized as blue points, the pink-colored "newborne" are more difficult to identify in the star circle hall.
This star-shaping region - by scientists called unromantic W5 - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star picture Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shilling glut of a dying star has taken up the Spitzer telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star slung out in the death process.
In the giant trifid nebula, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
The Spitzer telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birthroom.
The Plejaden stars, also called "The seven sisters", can be seen at night with the only eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula looks to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star picture.
His similarity with an earthly continent brought this fog the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular coloring.

One of the largest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on colouring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Observatory shows the several thousand light years away trifid nebula in the star image shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three divided, three columns), as dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birthplace three parts.
In the star image Snake carriers, astronomers have photographed the prefixes of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing together and will inevitably conflict with each other.
This star's birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiral Galaxy M83.
If there are no technical abbreviations, it may be called by her nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of Hubble's space telescope shows a cut from the irisnebel in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of Galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this star novel, the brightest group of young stars is our Milky Way.
The starweet always produces new youths.
These star clouds, connected with the rosett nebula, also produce ongoing new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was only created shortly after the first knall when it was mainly in the universe to be found hydrogen.
Our insights in the All: The most important telescopes
The telescope is supposed to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galileo took it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown - and the insights they provide are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest remote tube in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Great Binocular Telescope stands.
It allows looks into the All just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescope Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Yet, he reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap design: The telescope is attached to its height angle - and thus limited in its movement.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality: the high light accumulation power.
This is the world's largest mirror telescope, despite the relatively small mirror diameter.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) every computer owner can help by providing accounting performance.
Watching the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the mean infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main level is to cover 42 meters - and composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
But images can be expected at least in 2018.
By 2007 the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equally two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it is to be amazed on a illustration.
However, the main impressions from the All provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already provided pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extra solar planets - mainly for those who are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been detected since the mission began.
In the picture, the latest start-up preparations are documented at the Kepler space telescope.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board an Ariane5 rocket to the All at the beginning of 2018.
The primary level of the space infraredlescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is intended to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urchal.
Scientists assume that there is also a South Pole of Merkur ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the Messengers cries far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been indicating for decades that there is ice on the Merkur.
Through the Messenger-Sound launched in 2004 - the first one that cries around the Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Drink every day butter - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblely high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblely high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch mountains is called wilddromantic.
The small bus runs across the curved road, passing tightly forested hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and soft, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian group of the Talys are living, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerian and is very long-lasting.
End station is Lerik.
The small town prospers with too weightly radiated architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too disturbing is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital of Baku.
For the 323 kilometres, you need eight hours because the road is only tracky.
The legendary wealth that the country is due to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision-Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Longlife, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
A child still born at 136 years of age
However, the controversial star of the museum is the sheephirt Çirali Müslümov, which is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who became 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explained Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, he was supposed to have born a daughter at the age of 136.
So did Irali Müslümov age for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, agency researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-aged people in Central Asia.
"Aroundly many high-aged people are also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "also in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
However, because of the lack of documentation, there is no scientific evidence of the age, especially as the personal status register is missing.
Blended butter every day
The fact is, however, that people around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many old people live here in the south?
The Azerian traveller Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
On the other hand, museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is at the diet.
But that the calories rich food of the talys are to be so healthy, that the meat, bread, and especially milk products are loved, and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily appears not quite plausible from the nutrition scientific perspective.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemaran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a butterfat that she rolls down and down in tiredness.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are long-term grandparents.
Two babys are also jumping around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea, which is served in the typical, bouquet-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in rice and leather, under her headwear she hides long, dark-blown cups that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough for life
She always eated only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, herds.
All my life I haven't bought food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
The worst was the time after World War II.
But everything became better than the "loved Father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rod.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father character of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, is hardly aware of borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the robber.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, a amount of which you can live well for current conditions.
And maybe Mirzayevas has the right for the long time: "The old ones enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the great family, be loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising proclamations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with the Sharia as a basis is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, in the face of the people and before God," he said in the public.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but most likely to the Christian cups, the liberal, informed Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly disputed in a confusive opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of Graces of the mighty Muslim Brothership.
According to Mohammed Mursi, he almost apologized, he temporarily cut the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competences "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral title at the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, is what the Egyptians are about, the world is not completely clear.
Should the Judicative be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles that were plowed by the Islamistly dominated 100-headed Constitutional Assembly are partially encouraging in a nightly, 15-hour parforceritt.
As in the former Constitutions, the draft, the legal procedure, is based on the principles of Islamic law.
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is the case of interpretation and it is fearful that the Islamists will use the swammy formulation and the accompanying legal space for a more strict interpretation of the sharia.
At least a newly added article suggests this: in all the matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation throughout the whole Sunitian Islam.
This must not be, but it can mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, which would de facto have resulted in the dismissal of the judicial.
Many things in the draft text are interpretation matters
Similarly, civil justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opposers during Mubarak’s rule.
After the dictator's crash, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The State should also, as it says in the draft, "the true being of the Egyptian family" "protect and promote their morality and values".
This is so unprecedented legally that government institutions could even control the content of film art and literature using this article.
In the plaintx, it means nothing but censur.
No article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
Another forbids to offend or blaspheme the prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is an insult, and how it is to be sanctified, remains unclear.
Likewise dubios urges the formation that "infringement of humans" is forbidden.
Is there enough a chain of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation matter, as is so much in the draft Mursi for signature and, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the supramination of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual entrance on Friday evening on the Tahrir spot in Cairo and vowed to bring the Charter to fall before it can enter into force.
"The Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed by the presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prize and Ex-Chairman of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the Constitutional Draft was "to the Wasteberg of History".
By means of a short news service Twitter, he accused the followers of Mursis to want to lead a "push against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and fall him," said the oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not even tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet reconciled," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition policyer Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood remained for their part to the counter demonstration, but not to be careful on the Tahrir place, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer at the University of Cairo.
Many concealed women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and called: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi, "Cause the land!" and said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the majesty over the symbolic Tahrir place on which everything began would probably have brought up civil warlike conditions.
Clearly, Mursis' followers did not want to risk this.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opposers of the Constitutional Draft and the Professors had spoken out loudly and clearly.
Now be the time to let the people at the election tour decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft Islamists is considered to be safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were sitting under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are indispensable to him.
He was struck, sentenced, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complains in his conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three forces in the state let the lawyer resign.
These measures are violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto puts it out of force," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels alone, including by the international community, who considers the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "You bear a monster that you can't control anymore."
Racfish from Norway: Is this the worst smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but worldwide.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with the local appetite on pretty badly smelling fish?
You will take a selection of overwhelming cheese.
They are placed in the middle of a bunch of dirty, moist sports clothes.
And give them a week there.
Thus, you have to imagine the nasing smell of Rakfish, one of Norway's big delicates.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this hard-napped smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfish is salted forel, which - depending on how stinking it is - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather becomes colder, Norways stream to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very bestowing speciality.
"You eat it roughly and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Half Arsen, who actually works in the local fire guard, but as so-called "Rakfisk General" also organises the festival.
People eat small fish cubes around us and take large quantities of alcohol to themselves.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfish," says Havard.
Spirituosis can suppress the smell.
I'll cost a couple of cups.
If you avoid bringing the rockfish into the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind you.
Racfish is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were no cooling possibilities and fish was drowned in air density salt water vessels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and devoured with alcohol.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and mostly wandered to the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who were far richer than Norway, stream immigrants.
Rakfish is considered to be something important - a more essential, though strictly fragranced part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually here is everything expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it in the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here you still hate to name Anders Breivik - those racist judicial extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "event of July 22".
Norwegians are difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today's wealth in Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our minister, who distributes round tablets with mature rockfish and represents the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the stiff blue eyes.
We are a cautious people, as you say.
Their English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very profound, we don't like practicing.
Norway has handled its oil riches very carefully - a large part of industry yields are invested in a special fund for future generations.
When, in the years up to the world economic crisis, all of them were thrown around with money that they did not own at all, Norway kept its stock exchange firmly locked.
"As long as we can drive ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat rockfish," she adds with unpleasant laughing.
I'm standing in the snow and standing for another court - I've got enough of Rakfish.
That's something else, anyway, that soft meat makes me feel.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is back on the food plan.
The hotel where I stay is one of several places of events that organize a rockfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenged - fish.
There is a live TV scenario to a fly-coated showmaster surrounded by plates with rockfish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're clapping and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict thinness of all the fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto stands for a difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his official entry, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges and mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a constantly blocked city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks up several major roads to the capital and carries chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential commitment and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's in the face of a complex task.
Under the divorcing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically well, but the country is under control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is very committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that enables us to achieve this objective.
Before he joined the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this dense, widespread part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions are divided about the new Head of State.
A direct man
For example, in the distant small town of Valle del Bravo you would like to remember him.
Inhabitants of the vacation site ascribe to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement towards the broken, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name are also hanging outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," said his friend and political associate Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congress representative for the Pena Nietos Party, the PRI.
In particular, what security and economy concerns, we hope that our country will need an interesting and real change that is so urgently needed.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Assembly Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pino, the party is making great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of opposition, the new President lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an outstanding stateman, but especially he is someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, contrast to the plunged streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and represents in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are of decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was launched to combat drug bands operating in the fourths, and violence against women is a particularly urgent problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large waste deposit, the bodies of thousands of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the period of office of Gouvernor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is famous for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
However, in the worst case, his government has closed their eyes from the problem.
In a concrete building, typically for the downcoming quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her lifemate.
"When I came home to her, it seemed as if her body was washed," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is fitting next to a cross that has a single word: justice.
But just this, like the family, has been denied.
The authorities treated me like I was a talker, annoyer, nörgler.
They want you to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential commitment on Saturday, he also takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been embarrassed over the last six years of violence, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem especially during his term of office.
"I hope that as president he is the way he was governor," says the PRI Congress Assembly Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of that.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor contradicts Bradley Mannings' allegations that he was mistreated in prison.
The hearing deals with Mannings' time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The Defense seeks a rejection of the charge due to harsh conditions of arrest
The liberation of the US army is condemned to have used thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the public prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in US history - missed several occasions to complain about the mistreatment he claimed to have suffered in military.
In a cruise hearing of Mannings during a prejudice hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fin explained that documents for weekly visits that had been conducted by prison officials during the nine months of prison in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaint about his treatment.
One day before the interrogation, which was held as a result of a defense request for rejection of the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard duration of arrest - Manning had stated that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army Secret Service Analysis, arrested in June 2010, is condemned to have stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq during his service time.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fine with Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his prison in the quantico military prison, where he had suspended under reinforced conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a "very professional".
The forms, such as fine, did not contain complaints about abuse, although the officials had directly consulted Manning on his treatment.
Manning replied that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials would have discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them.
"They wrote (after the discussion of concerns) "No problems" and that didn't necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning answered that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military stated that it has assigned him this restrictive status - which is a step under the risk of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and moved to Kuwait, where he was arrested nearly two months before moved to the prison of the Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and once became unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world would have been a burden.
"My world shrinked into camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
They only allowed him a mattress, a ceiling, flip flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or to go down.
He always had to sleep with light that went from outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face anymore, they raised him to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at a morning counting.
Manning had said that during this counting he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling.
At the interview on Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from a order of his guard that he should drop the ceiling with which he could have covered himself. However, he admitted that no one had invited him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he had been forced to sleep naked the last night, and he would have tried to show a official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the covenant of his subheads or his flip flops to hurt himself, but did not.
In that night, Manning said that his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his arrest experiences and drastically reduce his arrests, he should be condemned in his trial before the military court, which is appointed for the beginning of next year.
The Defense has indicated that Manning will confess less offences of guilt, while other charges that are considered to be too extreme should be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is held for this weekend.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners stored under the highest safety arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the beneficiary of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the stealing of public property or documents.
If he finds himself guilty in all charges, he is threatened with lifelong penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them into memory difficult times, he says.
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when ignorance became widespread in me.
Paints refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicanos"), another for "Extranjeros" ("extranjeros").
I was standing there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "mexicans" all my life.
A ethnic accelerator - exactly as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided for "Mexician-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for accelerators or binding lines.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't share the vocabulary of a parent speaker, and I will not lose my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why today the Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico rather than migrate to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention details in this respect.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resistance.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States fell into Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under the gun to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not ignored.
As soon as a U.S. government official also exercises mildest criticism on Mexico, there are complaints - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how the Americans press the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the war path.
Yet, Mexico's biggest challenge is indeed in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person – perhaps a parent or grandparent – was not offered a chance in Mexico and emigrated northwards.
And in most cases, this person matched a profile - dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose our eyes that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be diminished, but what our loyalty concerns is not the case.
This applies clearly to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership team do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a meal of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands will never be strong enough to Mexico.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves caught behind the side curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them badly.
While she is American citizens, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they are neither one nor another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to resume their connections with diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary " messengers" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on political leadership to intensify their relations with Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, unrestrained corruption and drug violence, many of us are not as sure that it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through there alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico six and a half centuries ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans are greasing for how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexican" than I thought.
Old Battle, New Middle East
The standing of weapons between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected foundation pile for peace
Can there ever be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to swell such a hope in the room.
In the midst of the ordinary debt allocations, numerous buildings were placed in destruction and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were beaten.
Although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these viries.
Perhaps this will only lead to more blood sheet.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly patch situation could finally find its end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first view, optimism seems all other than appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the gun stops agreed on 21 November, these weekly fights have strengthened the hard-sooked ones on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has controlled the Gaza stripes since 2007, will be claimed to have pushed the Israeli back, although its grouping had to cause great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being captured in one of the desolast and tightest population corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas in the Western Ocean wins, which is controlled by the competitive, temperate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a reinforced, regional power once considered the closest Muslim alliance of Israel, has taken action for the Hama party - just like Katar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Joyful Hamas followers believe that Israel is a Islamic half-mond - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of increasingly Islamic impression could stand before Bashar Assad’s crash, to Jordan, where Hamas alliance threatened the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabitant and most important Arab country - at the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainablely.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time for the Hamas left.
On the contrary, the brotherhood with the Hamas is consumed and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be a player who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
On the other hand, the Israeli Hardliners make a contradictory conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas are no longer in danger.
The Israeli raket defence system, "Iron Dome", has proved to be good and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is constantly holding their position, and many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamine Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although missiles from the Gaza Strip have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide attacks - not least thanks to the blocking plans that are going into the western part of a possible Palestinian state, but they keep protecting the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawful, but are continually expanded.
Netanyahu is well there. His Likud party was connected with an even more fighting group in front of the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these tricky Palestinians also halt and leave their own state?
If they really had control over the western land, wouldn't they, like their competitors in the Gaza strip, fire off missiles?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should dare lifting their heads.
Perhaps the Hardliners will be able to go through, but the Arab Spring could make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense system of Israel is larger than its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama to reach a weapons stop could be a promiseful sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world takes considerable steps towards democracy, Palestinians continue to rob their self-determination rights - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression now undermines democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only intensify.
Blood missions to repress the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outer kick
The right answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states where Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future small - is that the resistance of arms will give outsiders more influence to implement this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop the arms deliveries in the Gaza branches and is better positioned than ever before to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by district exchange and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the foregoing request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to the move of Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he would be alike dismissed.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging are in force
Health warnings and ill body parts on neutral green packages equal to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colors with neutral olive green ceiling, which are also printed with drastic pictures, which are sick parts of the body and the sick infants and children.
From the different health warnings and pictures once, from the next Saturday, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small font is the only one.
In this way Australia introduces the most stringent rules for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian Federal Government wants to bring young people away from smoking by removing the glamourous picture of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26 will not start smoking with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message to try to apply to tobacco companies with their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoke rates in the world and the changes will only have a small impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries already consider similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It said that the laws would favour black-market trade, leading to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakes will offer far larger quantities of these products on Australia's streets.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have circumvented their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette nets and silicone covers have increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco were failing at the Upper Australian Court of Justice two months ago.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and waited for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook in the popularity of social media is exactly the population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from acting as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in businesses. Now tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited internet advertising by local companies and sites but has no influence on international sides.
"He who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for his products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has discovered an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
One must ask himself: Is this just a private person who finds so much pleasant to Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to combat the new rules - those countries are complaining about unfair trade restrictions in the World Trade Organisation, although none of the countries are dealing with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid 2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country that prescribed photographic warnings in 2001.
It has now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves despite.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You simply take a cup and hide the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, Operator of the Tobacco Trade "King of the Pack" in the city centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shelves.
"Before I took an hour to subscribe to a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he obviously adds upstairs.
In a constantly electricized world it's nice to be bored even once
This thanksgiving I spent unexpected five hours at the airport when our plane fell out because of mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts boring.
I don't want to lie.
A half day waiting at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally free shopping) are available.
However, increasing numbers of academics and child development experts lead to boring as something positive.
If it goes after them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be sometimes bored.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring on one screen or another, the benefits of boring no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the boring with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
As many people, I have always assumed that boring is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not think so.
"In fact, boring has a very long story," he says.
The walls of Pompejis are decorating a Latin graffiti over boredom, which depends on the first century.
And then there's the question how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, a associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long lecture of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boring can be defined as the experience of "exercising a satisfactory activity, but not to be able to do so".
As a result, boring differs from apathy as a result that the person is not busy but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no urge to do something when it comes to apathy.
The key experience of boring, he says, exists in a "interruption of the attention process, paired with bad calm and feeling that time is only going slowly".
Pain can listen to it almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two situations could be related to them, vulnerable people see the problem in their surroundings or in the world, while depressing people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficulties to concentrate.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - on German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in the "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, pointed Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to a previous experiment to listen to a band on which a person presented a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who heard the hardly hearable television claimed to feel more boring than the two other groups - they had problems with focusing, could not find a reason for them and gave their difficulties to bore.
When you try to focus on a difficult or effortful task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boring, says Mark J. Fenske, a associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are exercising a one-tonic activity - "like the search for malfunctional products on a factory support band, music can distract and help not to feel bored".
Actually, he says, we now know that circulations and criterion cells, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically aware.
"Students have shown that children who are allowed to hammer are learning more and keeping more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a drunk loudspeaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are more boring than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale to boredom vulnerability".
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With such scales, researchers have found out that boys are often boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor in psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater diversity of external excitement.
But generally, teenagers are a pretty relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the adults in school and in doing homework were bored, while 23% indicated that they were bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents claimed to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
He is sure, however, that "young people are felt particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their everyday life.
So back to my original question: Is boring healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling out of gambling or drugs to relieve them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, who has researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor in psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can cause luck in the short term, but they will refuge again in the long term.
Thus, whoever is a iPad enough for his boring child can do so, but it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is transmitted from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain himself but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should be boring.
We should also not see them too critical.
Rather, our goal should be to feel well beyond the constant development of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boring is the tormenting, constant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are just looking for one way, shutting down and relaxing.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to work out when the noise is stumbled."
In Colorado there is no clear guide for the new Marihuana Law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in the southeast of Colorados, which will soon be legal in this state: the ownership of some fewer marijuana chunks and a pepper he smoked them with.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on the road on one September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drugs - cavalry killings, each with a punishment of 100 US dollars - and received a trial date.
"We are treated as criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the state's decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for use in its own use, the response in hundreds of smaller drug crimes depends less on the law than from the location.
Hundreds of irregularities around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer pursuing adults over 21 years of age for possession in a small amount, which is legally allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next few weeks.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced that they should continue to pursue existing marijuana crimes and still quote people before the court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-certified marijuana shops from opening into their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are scratching their heads.
They are waiting for a guidance aid to establish a licence system for production, production, sales and sales of the drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is believed to be predicted to most states as regards the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Ghost Supervisory Authority in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to serve in the sense of a gross guide.
"We don't have a real precaution that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will thus also form the endpoint of a grey zone where the state license system is not yet in existence, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practice issues must be clarified at this time - such as the state's standard of "approved access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis shop than in urban areas, especially in the seattle area," says Ben Livingston, speaker of the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently educated research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his employees in Aurora, in which he declared that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana crimes in persons over 21 years of age and that the police would not seek punishment notices for this offence.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban regulations for farmers of medical marijuana and persecute drug dealers.
In Veld County, Northern Colorados, Prosecutor Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana ownership, mainly in order to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 people have to be responsible for possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana in court, although many were also accused of other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to pursue infringements that were infringements of crime," Buck stated in an explanation.
The reactions are even in places such as the Rural Mesa County, where choosers rejected the Marihuana initiative, twisted.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer shows adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District State prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to fall down all outstanding ownership procedures.
"I don't think I waste my time using the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree to the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound circumvention of the large green experiment among local officials.
Prosecutors are a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents the prosecutor before the court and acts on the ground as speaker for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their life following criminal law that they still cannot accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first states that treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national patterns for the legalisation of drugs.
While speakers and government officials are preparing for a age of legal sale, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence.
Speakers of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several exciting arrests of consumers and salesmen of medical marijuanas, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama Government, is of the opinion that, although criminal officials are probably not going to encounter any doors to bear smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to strive to tolerate legal, governmentally regulated marihuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban that is likely to be adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We are focusing on what the municipality has decided and not on what the State has decided for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university I once thought was the world's largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposion that promoted the large pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry at Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had packed my bag again and thus brought to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
At Evening Standard it said I would have gone because I would have had a problem with the fact that Commilitons had sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson explained slimly that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran, because I suffered from systematic mobing and threats.
Not because of my pretty unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I was only shocked for one reason - a reason that seemed so tight and cruel in this claimed way of lighting: My dead father Woodrow Wyatt was now an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, current reports say that a new generation of students of tempered rights suffers similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred on Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded the same protection of equal rights last week, which benefits homosexuals, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College suggest that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted" because of their political views.
They call for a place in their college's Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an excentric and neonazis.
This was shown among other things by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a rolls royce and produced with silver-colored suit and silver-occupied brass.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered to be "sond books for the introduction of higher study fees".
Luke Black, 20-year-old Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without ever getting to know us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the search for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she has seen a growing rejection of JCR members to students of tempered rights.
"This is a danger to the intellectual discurses and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
In the previous year, the university voted in favour of giving Margaret Thatcher, a former student, no credit because of cuts in university.
The atmosphere would even have scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know themselves and the tutors, I received a taste of future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the ridicule of Tory students but even participated with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the Apartity regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-tracked areas of the Tutorial.
At my first events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been captured of what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now died), "Please translate the first paragraph."
I was stumbling.
Pitt was a small man with a face like of cookie, and quite ugly.
"Did thatcher trailers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were chasing.
In my eyes, tears turned up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured me.
I returned to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I sat alone at college at dinner when someone ticked me easily on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he kindly said.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Everyone who is suspected to be Tory will be pressed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be attendants of the Labour Party.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to imagine myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher in all matters.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A study beginner in philosophy, politics and economy, who ironically visited the Eton College, which was conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist swine."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked me one.
They're hitting each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal laws of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet the equalists only after the burglary of the darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years in front of me stretched from my spiritual eye to a vain fire of authentication and isolation.
The only tutor that showed himself openly as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had consulted Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and written talks to them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and smallerly and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he adopted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started to pencil between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge in more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said little.
They would never do this, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my Communist friends always had proper manners.
His moist eyes were devastated.
Give the whole a chance.
I'm sure you're just being nailed.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory followers, had abandoned the pressure and his convictions.
During a tutorial in the next week, another history student seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was shy, I admitted that my parents had undergone me a "brain laundry" and called her "old fool".
The relief took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the bag of my Oxford carrier.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hats gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a crying tail.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such fear and evilness in a educational facility.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hides behind an undeserved reputation of equal rights and freedom of mind until today.
"Valentino prefers elegance of famousness"
At the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemacher.
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worth the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the skin couture were compiled, created by his "maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inconsistent Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always experienced fascination for the sticky and remote world of the noble.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about Princess Marie-Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest modemacher in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the noble must not be disadvantaged.
"They don't get out of their chickens on your glorious carpet, as it does some beautiful fame from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely acquainted with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modemacher.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began their career at the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Fatuous view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of susceptibility, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the gallerys in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long course that suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the course to admire a dreamy "audiens" that wears the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kenneddy chose for her wedding with Aristoteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti carried in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather that belonged to the Emperorial Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a western type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," said Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I prefer him to all others because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-Herzogine of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and the leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovapaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990 ’ s, it ended.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a murdered upper part with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not dependent on fashion, its possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocratine living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Mode
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modemacher called its closers) were necessary to make this ivory-bone silk dress with pearls, twelve different sticks and a four and a half meters long sweep.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the skine Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the upper society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the honour Legion, cumulates Garavani as many honors as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I'm always his refinery, his rest, his well-behaving and perfect outlook," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a Gala evening in the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; the time leaves no traces on him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the rocky, stone roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mineworkers who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to go down to the floor of his crater every day, where the sulphur gas that flows from the earth is strengthened in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders through the tremendous paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that rises up to a height of 2386 metres, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to rise in the shield rate, keeping balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not rush out and crash.
You know that every step can cost her life, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago at the slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocent for every kilo of sulphur that they cut down.
On the top, they travel the way between the tourists that they photograph like circus monkeys and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the weight, which a mining company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 has exploited the occurrences of the volcano and (not better said) its workers, paying 662 Indonesian rupias (5 Eurocent) for each kilo of sulphur.
This then sells it to the petrochemical industry for every 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) because this mineral is widespread every day and is used for the manufacture of wooden wood, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we usually wear 70 kg, we receive some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way, "Anto explains to us, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route, he takes three hours to complete, but at the end of the day he has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a very inhuman effort, but is the threefold of what he would earn with field work.
"The daily pay of the mining workers here, where the coffee harvest pays 15 000 rupias (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupias (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maur on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75.000 rupias (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard, but Anto was returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gas.
For three years, the 27-year-old Anto has set his life on Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already left the first traces with him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'll work here for two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-punished young man could work as a tourist leader, kneller, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a wire.
He divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluely in the darkness.
In the light of a small flashlight on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, he challenges the shadow.
Approximately 400 carriers load the basket with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur degradation to save costs, and provides no equipment to the carriers who work on their own bills and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) auction per photographic device that the guards of this nature park, together with the entrance money of 15.000 rupees (1.2 euro) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protested Madrusin, a stable 42-year-old carrier who has been working three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to wear up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "for as long as it goes" because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes cluck when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on its back, Unainik with its 53 years is only able to wear 50 kg.
Each day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks through a goat path between the bow to camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth far, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder works with his 30 years as a sulphur carrier.
The time goes away, but the poorness of the generation holds on in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeians are pushing the blame for having no children, on the career, stress and the costs of the property and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our citizen obligation and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a advertising for Minzbonbons, but yet - or just that's why - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local speeches, such as "Scuffs become a "bao" (laib) in the ovens to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising company, which has turned the video, has the hope that the advertising spot will achieve funny ways to make attention to the problem.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill their "national obligation".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
In the process of reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that it was a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of parfume with pheromons or the organization of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not forcefully lead to success.
So we thought, why not do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Who does not take this topic easy is the government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends 1,300 US dollars for political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of the government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in the southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservation of its government and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singapores get any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "larger career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have much more options in relation to life goals and to set priorities outside marriage and to form a family," she explains.
These changes in social situations have contributed to a higher number of single and delayed marriages and births whose result is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentments in the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the hardly thrown Xenophobie flowers against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the Government Party in Singapore achieved its worst election result last year since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, which has taxes, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It has already affected the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the individual, and that they prevent the construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold at days and even weeks faster than the larger living units.
This leads to them to be much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer directions that have previously been imposed on obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could enable the way to increase the national birth rate, the conversations with the Singapore workers working in the financial district are to be found that they will not have a significant effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, so it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," says another, some 20 years old man.
Men and women have their career, stress and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singapores have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can still do so much.
Offline Private is offline
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "the area of private life where you have the right to protect from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he announces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years who are frequently on the network.
In four of the cases they linked the term to "something very own" at personal level and "on the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't announce in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has had two years of accounts.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm spending my time with acquaintances too.
"I wouldn't share any photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crime, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures me to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
These include the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers to me, I'm just adding it up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or with friends" he says.
He answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he admits.
According to the boy, no one has made any comments or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone oppresses me or demands it from me, I simply disappear him from my user account" he admits.
José came to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was expressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just did it privately."
Then he explains a number of steps to set up a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he's insensitive to me or I want to erase him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with university graduation in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and youths, it needs to be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these sites, however, the rules have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master title in education at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and adolescents who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we still learn," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic "because we require them to have a defined criterion on what can be spread, published or said, and this in an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective, if it is most important for them to be popular, having thousands of friends without meditating on the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that bring them to thought.
"To say that they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some possibilities: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like that you published by a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Should everyone know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the social networks directives carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening up one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish" he explains.
Guardia says that the children have to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Finalisation of the Unasur Summit without publishing the Declaration of Lima
The sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance and should be theoretically signed by the seven present governments.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed them that they would be transferred after the Clausur, however, explained that it would be published at a certain time on the website of the Peruan Government.
In the case of questions concerning the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief explanations to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting was transferred in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the governments present at the meeting of Unasur, but not by the Peruan press speakers.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, which demanded more information.
Following that, the President-in-Office of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "Complete Statement" of the summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document on the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the IIIrd Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the press’s strong call, the so - called Declaration of Lima, which had been announced in advance, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA, you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but in a great extent limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Hague Court of Justice, which arises from a border conflict between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which starts on Monday in Den Haag, in the process that introduced the Lima against Santiago to listen to the pledoyers on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are presenting to this International Court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, was and continues to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and undergoes international courts," adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handprint before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subject to the IGH took place after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, had appealed against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of the International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after his president Fernando Lugo's release, has not participated in the meeting.
The hosting president Ollanta Humala opened the conversations in the morning and ended the summit in Lima shortly after lunch.
The Head of State left the final document in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over an investment amount of a total of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the objective of a South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He informed that measures would be promoted to improve cooperation in the fight against urban uncertainty and organised transnational crimes, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act in common and efficiently in the case of natural disasters.
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) is not allowed to take triumphant trains, but is intended to expand our production performance and show our people a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided to give a number of 31 symbolic projects the priority to improve the geographical relations in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms," said the Peruan President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects are five Peruans, which are located on the crossings of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participating in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega on the morning ( Saturday)," said Santos.
"We will all check these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will be treated as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus with regard to the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America has to learn about the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, whereas "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended at the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the government television in Peru that the Europeans were "killed in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "now are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reorganization of the United States Organisation (OEA) under the regulation to reduce the influence of the angel Saxony States and to take into account those signed by the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never oblige themselves to anything, and in return we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is unbelievable that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were "reasonable suspicions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and would not comply with its procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish justice which demanded him to interrogate in his state territory for a claimed sexual violation, while "the Swedish judicial procedure allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's message in London."
Correa explained that the risk of injury to Assange’s health and psychiatric condition would pose.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not a serious thing," said the state leader of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he may take physical and psychological damage because he was caught in a narrow space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa argued that the solution for the asylum, the Assange had been granted in the London Embassy since June, was the granting of a letter to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there were conversations with London to find a solution for the enclosed founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, but we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures on various European instances," he explained.
And "I believe that, if Britain grants this letter tomorrow, this is done."
And when Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on the Ecuador Embassy in London or on Skype, how the Swedish laws were allowed and in other cases, the problem was addressed.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defendant of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate "the medianity, the evil intent and the lie that defends the free expression of opinion."
"The biggest enemy of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who strive for profit and extortion," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador on the absence of such journalists "and neither by bankers nor by the Hegemonic and Spoiling Citizen countries" and took the preliminary view that he will, in a re-election, "develop the revolution to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and do not have opportunism and no legally dressed state strife" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay has been destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also holds the desire of his Colombian counter-over, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Haag, which predicted the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between both countries for "absolutely eligible".
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Middle American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be comprehensively treated in order to overcome and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes between Peru and Chile on the maritime borders before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international instances if both countries are obliged to accept the judgment, even if it is very difficult."
As regards the possibility of as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to reach his third mandate in success, he stated that he sees this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although it sometimes is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in the unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I must fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as president, then I'll withdraw from public life.
This is true if we lose.
"This is decisive," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he was travelling there for a planned routine treatment and that he would be expected to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a fallback in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima on the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was ended by calling for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Reason for dying due to AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "swap" without noticeable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such an effort that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), in which he arrived after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more Stigmata.
At that time, even the director of a Clinic of the IMSS avoided to say good-bye, "because it led to a baggage."
At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the hospital who do not know about their disease and who have already damaged the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after AIDS appears in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG, who said that this information was supported by a viewed scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of injury of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that there were greater chances that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years when counting 500 CD4.
Simplely, the above statements mean that, at the age of 25, who receives the diagnosis HIV-positive, in this sense can become "profoundly 75 years of age as long as he is under control," this expert explained.
In order to correctly organize this progress, it must be reminded that today the Mexican life expectancy is on average 76 years.
Even if death has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (OnUSIDA's Annual Report), it is true that 60 percent of the patients covered in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year there are 187 deaths, but it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
- So why do people still die on it?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any supply problems with medicines. The problem is that people get in advance because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to affect global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so all those who need this must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees to the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also to the patients such as Fabrizio who made his test at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason, because it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the Kaposi sarcom (a cancer-like tumor) which was one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather put it three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, practice sports and take the medicines.
Today his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his witness those who are afraid today in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
There are large holes between health programmes and the simple citizens, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has adopted the issue of HIV.
And most important is prevention.
In the places specified, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously separated, now they give us packages with hundred pieces, which are good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the risk subjects for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread spot question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmaceuticals and in the health system, who do not want to suspend youths, assured the correspondent.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condoms should not only be behind the shop table but in output equipment in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by young people.
It is not supposed to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and the motel, as Gouvernor Emilio González answered the question whether its administration would be distributed conservatively.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to draw closer to the condoms of those who already engage in sexual activity," he pointed out.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally located at the fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and at the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infectious cases occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the obligations of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unhealthy precautionary case will be created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country which has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that in the country of Stars and Stripes, the procedures for the survival of companies that allow the Mexican laws have no validity in contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas of the Northern District of Texas received on 15 June leads to a helpless exposure to the Mexican companies to the conquest of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States' Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that the creditors must be subject to the United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circle Court of Appeal at New Orleans first states that the main procedure is the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity of payments by companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was created for the harmonization of international trade law, whereby the American Law Institute was set up as a justifier.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy of Vitro's branches with their mother company, the majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are a half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed under the Group of the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
It is also correct that after the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro debt for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country hits.
For this reason, the González Sada family contradicts the same appeal court in order to make the vote at the plenary session, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not held, the Cerciorare objection, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, shall be made by the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The serious thing in this case is that the Court left a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in the context of the Law on Conkurses of Trade and in which it is pointed out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Conkurs Act.
It is also noted that the country has subjected to the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border inability to pay, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-bound caramble: a battle for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertising by the Mexican Air Traffic Traffic Associations against the former owner Gasón Azcárraga Andrade, which is accused of fraudulent administration, did not come forward several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Federal Association of Pilots) finally made progress.
The attempt referred to by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a penalty procedure against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is suspended to disability of justice.
Following this, the Supervisory Authority systematically refused to inform the Republic's principal administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove from the Bank IXE's trust account F/589, named Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administratora Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain of Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental guards, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented to a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In front of the Canacintra (the national Chamber of Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment that partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of the Senate asked to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of intellectual property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had taken the possibility out of view, because he considered them a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without any impact on the short-term liabilities, the Homex Stock Exchange Company markets more than 500 million pesos.
Emissions are the first of four equal emissions that promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
The company NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading enterprises of information technology, founded a group of companies under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bumler of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sport for more than 60 years and traveled the whole world.
A few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, officers and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"For my life in the basketball, I have set up a lot of hats, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the National Team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when he visited Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated and witnessed with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-operator or manager of the club.
"These were my best years I've enjoyed most because I've been allowed to be a part of eight masterships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a manager, co-operator or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships together from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted with a mastership in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Afterwards, Bartow recommended the freecast specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and was one of our best warpers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the United States for the first time at the Vorolympic tournament in Mexico.
Then the World Championship came in 1990, where we took the fourth place, which should actually have been bronze, if not this Canadian arbitrator who let us repeat the last tour for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the Olympiade 2004.
My favorite, however, is the team of Pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the U.S. team a fight, as at the time they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) back in that team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a kne injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which made us great joy, was those of the Vorolympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players because of the events on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boys like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else can you do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children do unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the results of the required training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, watch videos of music from my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a scrapless, stupid and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Oilmagnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He became 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back as J.R. this year in a new "Dallas" stack, died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birthtown Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the festivals of the Harvest Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and successive series, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all those who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived life in full trains," explained Gray in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with liver cirrhosis, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over years.
In 1995 a malicious tumour was detected in his liver and undergone a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Amazing Jeannie" of the NBC TV.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dhin" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He was also a performer of two combodies, which were only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema work included the criticism well-evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Prime Colors".
But it was his mastery interpretation of the magnificent awful J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain about the Ewing Clan and other figures in their surroundings was rayed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising "Who shot J.R.?", the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in competition houses.
The series thus reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by average 41 million spectators who transformed "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had swung her and threatened to represent her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, unsaturable man with a charismatic smile: a reluctant businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to instruct his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s grave stone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, a competitor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "enormous personality up and outside of the screen".
He is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts to those who have been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were emerged a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second stack was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informed the transmitter.
By Warner or by TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in the New York theatre stages in the early 1950s, then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California City of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything of which I believed it could harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After hepatic transplantation, he worked for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's gonna be okay for you."
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studys the "Ende of the World"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistent fishing shake: the end of the "long back counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the following two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict with Israel, the place of which the Christian theoretists believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last one in history.
In Temple, the accompanying professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and chemistry and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread with time," he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they were compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a accompanying professor in art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to keep the course back, in case the world doesn't go down," said Restall.
Despite the "previous decline" students need to study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State the final examination will be carried out on the early evening of the Apocalypse, so the students have no other chance than "to continue to work until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his course for students with a high average of 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received emails from students who asked if still places were free.
The students assure them that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic secrecy or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nurse explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"Not heard of a lesson where this is taught," he announced.
I enjoy it.
But none of the interviewed students - and less than a professor - explained to believe on the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in some way we discredit them," said Julie Seglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in the Western society that brings back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Nowhere else people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who informs the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an expression on an exception of a higher instance.
We've got a pardon from the Pope.
All the rest pointed out that many days were spoken by the last court over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophed that the 21st of December was the beginning of a seven-year period where the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
