Crying to the World
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have started well, crying and calling out in nature is beginning to pull people around the world.
“You have the collision, I need Iceland,” says a woman in the large world in comments on an advertising from the market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland at YouTube.
Another audience will keep Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says that it has to come as first to the end of Iceland, her loved one is settled there.
However, in the United States, she is unhappy and expects to wait for a few more months.
Another audience asks whether the road to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
It doesn't follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Eggill Thordsøn at the Peel advertising office, who came to make the ads together with the international advertising office M&C Saatchi, states that receptions have been more hopeful.
“I came to many Icelandic Inspired campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already begun to be assessed.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, that is to get foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has been amazingly well.
In a relatively short time, we have been discussed in about seven hundred media worldwide, totally reaching over two billion people.
The valuable value of this report is $1.8 billion.
It's not terrible."
The main market is the same as the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, although the Americans are not on their way to the country.
According to Egils, marketing areas such as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also taken care of them, such as Russia, which is a comfortable surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not particularly affected.
“ These ads have traveled far beyond what we expected, ” says Egill, but over four million people may have looked at YouTube.
“ We couldn’t have wished for a better start. ”
The pictures here on the opening took the Year Saeberg, the morning newspaper’s photographer, at the hands of advertisements that have the headline “Let It Out” last month.
The ropes went out wide and wide, as in the Wayway of the School, in Reykjavík, in the fourth place of Reynis, at the foss of the forest, and in the sunshine, and in the cave of the heads of the Shepherds.
The leaders were Samuel the Bear of Peter and Gunnar Paul the son of Olaf in the production of the Scots and the fear of the Son of God.
In their roles, Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Twenty Icelanders came to make the advertising, but at the same time recording in South was another group in Western and Western Feders.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic office,” says Egill, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been very well.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign employees with knowledge of the limits we are talking to."
Explosion: Discussion of the position on the labour market, a treasure of life, and more
Assmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Child Language, is here in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. on the Wave today.
He is also a minister of the labour market and discusses the position in the labour market as such, the Icelandair matter and other matters.
He also discusses rural matters and transports to land that have gone badly and have been disputed in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Dor Ingolf son, President of VR, is also presenting its criticism about investments in life assets and proposes ideas that work movements and professionals should withdraw from the governments of the funds to reduce the risk of economic expenses.
Then Ivar, the son of Ingimar, a traveler in the East, and John’s daughter Årnheid, the director of the Nordic Marketing Office, will be discussed about the position of travel services in the rural area.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading pronouncement of what is to come.
Listen to the section below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's how she looks today 25 years later.
Elisa Donovan, a playster, had a successful course in youth classes of every kind.
Yet, she was world - famous for her game as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married to one child.
She has been very small in the past, but she has been able to look over the way and express herself on Clueless in a lovely TV in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I must acknowledge that I built my person mostly on girls I met at schools that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the manuscript, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after night's guessing.
Today, some fifty cases came on the police board in the capital area, reporting in the police journal that matters have been multiplied.
The day at the Police Station on the Gate began with the need for police to switch to a person who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of an alcoholic race.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man won a permanent stay at the police station because of his conduct.
At that time, a man was arrested in the morning year, suspected of infringement in a company in Kopavog.
Police also had to interfere with two men in the United States because of announcements of physical attack.
Then, too, a woman sitting at the shopping center in Kopavog could not pay for the account after the meal was finished and was therefore called to the police.
Also, this morning, stealing on a car was reported in the center of town.
Renault’s white driver looked at her for a while, and she was then taken with a free hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Happy Crew - The Horrible Destiny of the Greeters
The doctrine has reached a flight on the Internet that curses the Joyful Group, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during the days, thus became the third chief player of the parts to leave life long before age.
The themes of the “Glee ” are a popular series of songs, dances, and joy.
These were the so - called joy teams of youths at school, their love, and their fate.
It was not always a pleasure to be in the joyful group, but through singing and dancing, the individuals of the parts seemed to overcome all the circumstances that arise in their life.
But outside the scenes, there have been a lot of disasters over the players and employees, so much that the teachings have awakened that curses are on the parts.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the sections, a complaint manager who did not call all his grandmother.
After the series of parts had run its course, Rivera began to have Ryan Dorsey, who had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and distinguished.
However, Dorsey refused to complain, and the problem of domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, last year, Rivera was reported to be missing after her four - year - old son was found alone on a boat in the Lake Piru Lake, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a rescue west on a boat and could report to the police authorities that he and his mother had stuck to swim and then Rivera had brought him back to the boat but never left himself there.
A huge search for Rivera increased.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we were looking for as far as Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially decreed.
It is believed to have landed in a large amount of stream in the water and made her last requirement to rescue the son.
The cause of death was recorded by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the parts, the American footballman with the angel voice that played a key role in bringing the Joy Team to glory and respect.
Yet, outside the parts, Moneith struggled with personal devils.
Since he was 13 years old, he had suffered from addiction and proved hard to escape from it.
In 2013, his colleagues found enough in the parts, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and seemed to look to better roads.
Only two months after he finished his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out with friends.
Banamein proved to be a mortal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that it was a willful work.
Moneith had been treated, and his tolerance for gifts had decreased so much that the dose he had previously suffered was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was severely affected by his fellow workers, but his opponent, Lea Michele, was determined to continue to take the parts, devoting them to a whole part of Moneith’s memorial and his Finn’s personality.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck ” Puckerman in the parts, Puck was an American footballman, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow members in the Joyful Party, or so far until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles, suspected of child pornography.
At his home search, a huge amount of child pornography was found, and soon the matter was asked out publicly.
It was evident that Salling had been over.
Afterward, he was accused and convicted for his wrongdoing.
He had four to seven years of prison, along with what he would have to do with sexual criminals and seek the treatment of childish love.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found to be left near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not only the actors of the factors that fell from far before age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant player.
In 2013, he was shortly asleep, only 41 years old.
We also worked with a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of Julia Robert’s grand star, who did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governmentality and disrespectful behavior.
Motes died her own life in 2014, with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée, where she called her mother and sister, among other things, responsible for her situation.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings will have nothing but the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the parts.
She has recently been accused of using her fellow actors of traiting and overtaking at the location and having overwhelmed astronomists.
Jesse Luke played a guest role in the 2012 parts.
He was arrested and accused of a alcoholic race in 2019, which was intimidated.
The playster Heather Morris played a major role in the parts.
In 2010, she found unprushed computers into the naked pictures of it and appeared on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the parts and in love outside the parts.
Benoist later reported that Jenner used violence in her relationship.
Flowers can be put on almost everything
It increases the maturity of children when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and thrive.
Similarly, one Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out that flowers can be used in an endless way.
Just having time with the children in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth class
“I don’t think we’re seeing many sailors working at the country’s playground schools,” says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, who is fishing on the beach in the summer but takes psychology at the Icelandic University over the winter time.”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer work when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have good income, and I feel great to be able to let go of your course.
The revenues also make me good in the winter," says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, a 25 - year - old psychologist who is fishing on the beach in some summers like the last summer.
Axel was the newest to bridge the Talknaphrine when a journalist spoke of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“ The tithe grade I was in, I took shipping rights for boats less than 12 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I graduated from the primary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my friend, Hartmann the son of John, and I gave the boat his name.
Hartmann was grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being on the sea, and he was very satisfied when he saw that the boat was carrying his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, ” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had been fishing.
So I had the boat indebted at the end of this first summer on him."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just finished the primary school?
“ I had put my money together, I had been working with my dad to the sea when I was a boy, I was all some fishing with him and got my part.
I also put my square money in my boats."
Axel is born in the Icelandic garden, from where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Copavog since he was a boy.
“ I can fish here in the western area because I have a law home with my grandmother on the Icelandic feather.
I learned in these areas west of the roots with my dad.
I move between the distances according to how I feel; for this fishing area covers all the West.
Even though I think it's best to be on the west side, I've also given around the snowfall and other things.
I've also given for the south, but for the most graceful,' says Axel, who always runs one light early in the morning and sometimes speaks to the mavana and sing to the heavens, for the hours alone on the balcony.
“ The network out on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to video shows, and music.
I don't feel like being alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid entering the weather, but certainly sometimes something has been going on, but never a great danger," says Axel, who is lucky with the fact that he is never sea-sick.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how fishing is going each time.
“I have never been fishing more than 14 hours at once in the beach, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the taxi quota, but then I have been kept on fishing for one and a half days on the sea. ”
The arrangement for coastal fishing says that he may hunt 770 kilos a day, which he finds inhibiting.
“There are other limits that I may not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may hunt only twelve days a month, these four months of fishing on the beach, in May, June, July, and August.
I think sailors should choose their hunting days after weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is required to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their head.
So the area sharing could also go for me, and a sea lock that is well placed at the fishery should enjoy it," says Axel, who draws most of the villages of salt sea on its beach fishing, but also only Ups and some other species flow with.
Axel is working over the winter hours with the college at the Nupi School in Copavog.
“ I don’t think we’re seeing many sailors working in the country’s play schools, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only planning to work temporarily at the school.
“ I got stuck there because I find this awesome job.
I hope that the psychology study will benefit me from the stage of school in the future,” says Axel, who has also studied business.
Error registry prevented return control
An error in a recording magazine that people filled out when they arrived in the country resulted in a person, who lived here in the country, was not called back to exhibition.
It is not a condition to register the ID if the person fills the leaf in English, as it is already done in English.
“ This will be examined this week, ” says an expert in the field of pollution.
Three domestic infections were identified at the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the application of so - called home - to - home rules.
The residents in Iceland are then investigated at the land’s arrival and again proclaimed at the exhibition four to five days later.
On the other hand, RUV’s lunch news revealed that the person had applied the old system.
The exhibition on the border was negative, and it was not called back in the screen for the virus.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus - daughter, a specialist in the field of pollution, says to a news station that this may be a mistake in the electronic recording magazine.
Filling out the paper in English is not a prerequisite to insert the ID, as it appears in the English version.
Finally, it was mainly thought of foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person was not automatically invited to show.
However, Camilla says that even though they have filled in English, and in some cases, employers have also been alert to send people back to the show after they arrived in the country.
“ This week will be examined how accessibility can be facilitated by people to draw their attention to the process. ”
The man is isolated, and six have been infected.
They're all taking a show, but two of them have been showing symptoms.
Infectious effects are now undergoing the three infected infections that were diagnosed yesterday, mostly because of two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, a series analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are variations of the chronic virus not previously found.
In the second case, Israel has been directed to know that the person moving the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it should be tomorrow where the other virus would come from.
A total of 15 is now in isolation according to the tissue of COVID. is.
135 are infectious.
Four out of five infected unconnected
Five domestic infections have been identified here in the past days.
Of these, four of them are not connected and have not been found for the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
Infectious drinking is still present.
Originally, at the end of the third decade, they were dispatched to sixteen.
Overall, there are 34 infectious diseases due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is for the second time in a short time that detects sports events, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Johansson, Head of Communist State Police Office, says that very slowly, as long as people follow standards and rules.
“ We are constantly inclined to all those who are living here to maintain individual infectious products.
We also need to emphasize that certain rules have to be applied.
Then there is an event to be held," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping individual infectious agents in the air.
Moreover, rules and criteria are constantly reviewed.
“ What needs to be done, and what the General Disaster Department and the Medical Office are constantly inclined to people, is in mind of these individual infectious agents.
Both home fronts and the same for service companies.
That people are washing their hands and using alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on," says John.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to maintain the results that we have achieved here. ”
40% of victims of COVID-19 were diabetic 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone the difficultness of her father’s breathtaking.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical assistance.
The next day, he was dead.
Death was detected to sudden respiratory difficulties due to chronic virus infection.
Diabetes were indicated on the death witness as a underlying problem and is Brumfield, who also has diabetes, feared that the only thing will happen.
The Reuters report says that the fear of Brumfield is not reasonless.
The numbers of new studies by the U.S. authorities show that at least 40% of those who have died were diabetic 2 as the underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is considered, the ratio increases to half.
A study of the U.S. C.C. (CDC) was conducted by more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the chronic virus during the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious expert, says that the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed by diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters ’ slow growth was hidden, indicating the answers from the 12 countries that responded to a similar proportion.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet reported the underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes were already epidemic in slow growth.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful century," says Reuters by Elbert Huang, Head of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes are more common among black and south-American people, which have also become worse from the chronic virus.
One of the best ways to protect those with diabetes 2 is to keep the illness under control by physical training, healthy diet and healthcare professionals.
On the other hand, the chronic virus age has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In that case, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to work and thus risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When SARS transcended the chronic virus in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and in the pig age of 2009, this group for three times greater risk of hospitalisation.
When MERS experienced this in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were investigated were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic could have taken away a number of previously unknown complications.
“ I fear we will see a flood wave of problems when this is over, ” says Andrew Bolton, president of the International Association of Diabetes.
Doctors have warned that indirectly the age of chronic virus could lead to increased complications associated with diabetes, including kidney diseases and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies aim to ensure that the chronic virus could lead to increased diabetes.
Reuters say that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the chronic virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many diabetic patients.
In this case, a high proportion of glucose and lipid in diabetics can produce a truely called ‘cell messenger storm’, as it is called when the immune system responds too hard and attacks the body.
Injured pack cells can also lead to inflammation, which again can cause fatal blood clots.
“ This is all one big pussy, ” says Dela Cruz.
"This is related to all of the invite."
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, and they went out of the room."
Assrún Magnus ’ daughter and Atli Bollason, the couple became the extraordinary request of the artist Ragnari’s son of Art to have sex in front of a camera for work set up by the artist in Paris.
“We loved each other, so it wasn’t complicated. ”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and grandmother, Asruna, daughter of Magnus.
“ I was very pleased with her.
It was naturally just the radiation, but then, too, she felt quite unheartedly cute.
And I'm still sorry," he says.
Assrun also remembers the end of this, the husband recalls the first regular discovery.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Last only the weekend," she says, "who also attracted to the husband at the first time.
“ I found and feel so excited about Atla, which I love.
There's a lot going on and a lot to happen, and I'm thrilled by it."
Atli says that their husband and wife have stressed their own ways in their relationship.
“ We don’t tie our bags together with travelers.
We avoid routines that we see around us."
It is possible that they took the matter from the artist’s son of Ragnari, even though this would be unusual.
“Christine Anna, our common friend, has contact with us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragnar’s wife, Ragnar’s, and Ingibjörda, on Snaps. ”
They accepted the invitation, met the threefold on Snaps, and got a desert wine and their dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through their plans for a video show that he wanted to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, during the autumn.
“ He had a multi - channel knowowork called Scenes from Western Culture.
He declared it in a simple way."
Assrun says that he described the work as deadly and decadent from the Western people’s everyday life.
“ He had a sketch of all the visions he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in. ”
Senan, to whom Ragnar asked the couple to participate, should show a young interstitive couple loved in a minimal room.
“ It’s a relationship with the beginning and end, ” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know much about Ragnar, even though they knew about him and he knew of them “but they knew us and felt that they fit in this.
They had the word that they would not advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they would not get the right people, but people who would receive sexual excellence from performing for others."
They moved Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take a long time.
“ When we broke off from Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrun and Atli.
"It's about love and companionship"
Senan was taken up to a fine apartment on the Miergate.
There was a very low level of film teams; the films, Ragnar, the musician, and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, all the rooms left to wait in a car except Atli and Ásrun.
“ We hadn’t decided how we should be.
We were given some instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for each one.
There was nothing game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Assrun.
But was that romantic?
“Yes, this was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Ásrún agree.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a fine hotel in Paris."
The team was satisfied with the performance of the pair in the work that moved them.
“ When Tommy looked at this, he cryed, he felt so beautiful, ” says Atli.
“ This is as much about love as the neighbors are, ” says Assrun.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice of his son at the Library of Reykjavík, and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and starts to peel in this, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Assrún recalls.
And would the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Asrull and Atla?
“ At least we are still together, so maybe this deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with my family,” says Assrún and laughs.
Assrun himself saw the job in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“ I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else, ” she says and turns to her husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because it’s just one sent in a much bigger work, and when you saw it with the other works, it’s very nice.
I could cut a little away from this, and I was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by the other child of the couple when the sene was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to the Asrúine and Atla in Love Stories at Council 1.
Swansea with victory in the previous final game
Swansea won the 1-0 victory of Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the preliminary play to get to the English Division.
The game went to Swansea's homeland in Wales.
The half-game status was 0-0.
The homes of Swansea received a 64 - minute hell, but Andre Ayew failed the archaelics of the White Point and was defended.

Hence, Brentford played the rest of the game of a man less, and in the 82th minute new players Swanse the team.
Andre Ayew then added the victory by scrutinizing a great goal and guaranteed Swansea 1-0 victory.
Swansea leads 1-0 in the environment, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Without master for five years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, U.S. ambassador in Iceland, is in the public after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed lifeguard in fear of his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors here in the country.
Since Carol Van Vorst left the office of the United States’ ambassadors in April 2009, the country has been free for 62 months, more than five years.
In 2009, Kastlys reported that she should have received the false word.
At a greeting meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international communication with the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until the successor of Van Fürst came to work, in September 2010.
In some ways, Robert S. Connan had been appointed as an ambassador, but then resigned.
Finally, Loius Ariega had served for decades in the field service.
In the autumn of 2013, he left his jobs and received the office of ambassadors in Guatemala.
Then the second free period of ambassador took place.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Congress in January 2015 and soon later came to work, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diplomat, but had served as a lawyer and supported Baracks Obama’s council.
He left his jobs as soon as Donald Trump accepted the presidential office of January 20, 2017, as is the custom of a politically appointed ambassador.
Trump’s government was unusual to appoint both ambassadors and high officials in Washington’s governance system.
Thus, two years until the U.S. Congress proclaimed Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him out and confirm it as an Icelandic ambassador.
In his witness at a congress, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who died, had been broken from a Dutch mountain.
Gunter is appointed politically, was formerly a skin doctor in California and has been prominent in the Jewish associations of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The game owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, but Adelson is the enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but no ambassador had been on the country since the early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example of the country.
The reason is both how long Trump's control was to name people in key offices that have been working in the United States' Congress in recent years, including confirming ambassadors in office.
Thus, since 2009, Iceland has been unauthorized for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented the execution of the ambassador’s newly opened headquarters at Engateig.
The executions have been estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but nose-tight safety walls cover the building, and a sharp glass is in all windows.
However, it seems that it is not enough to fill the current ambassador’s feeling of security because he is said to be afraid of his life and has desired a armed lifeguard.
Former IBV player was subject to racism in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Maweyje, former IBV player, said that racism has occurred in Iceland and that he regrets his coming to the country.
This is seen in a interview with Tonny, appearing on the Ugandian media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who plays in Uganda's top department.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in the country, which he played with IBV, Val, and Development in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's leader was in that position, but he was also with the traitor number I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the playtime with IBV.
Among what Tonny talks about is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says that this is a problem for many black players when they play in Europe.
“ This happened to me once, but because I did not understand the language, I only ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
Then he told me that my opponent had given me a racist pronouncement after I tempted him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny had not reached the start team of Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the country team.
Then he asked to return to Iceland on a loan, and then he joined Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland to a loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably come further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has destroyed his dreams of getting into Europe’s great team.
Found a worm in a woman’s neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 sm long black worm in the throat gland of a woman looking there.
Doctors successfully pulled the worm out with a ton.
A study revealed that parasites were involved.
CNN reports this.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashimi, a thin meat.
The woman soon improved after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this often are in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, following sushi’s bed in the western countries, cases where parasites have flown into people have increased.
Fear that other waves will start in Europe
Spain is now in focus with concerns about the second wave of the chronic virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-enhance the spread of the chronic virus age.
In Catalonia all the entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where infections are increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action as a result of the increase in pollution in Spain, but in Britain, all have to be infectious when they come back from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned about travelling to Spain.
Infectious diseases are also increasing in France and Germany, since governments are trying to find the balance of the spread of the virus and re-establish economic life.
However, Europe’s situation is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but global infections are nearing 300 000 a day, where the most infected in America and South Asia.
According to the Johns Hopkins University, 16 million have been confirmed infected worldwide and 644 thousand deaths have been confirmed to be associated with the virus.
After all, the Mosaic work of the Maker will enjoy its fullest enjoyment
In front of the Reykjavík Tollhouse, there is a large and deep hole.
At the top of it, men have orange helmets.
There's also a big grave.
And more of my working machines.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the corpse is qualified, and many are now standing and viewing artworks from millions of mosaic tiles — just as they have never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it does not respect it.
To date, the job has been quite hidden, right before it was parking spaces that were always entrusted.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped to take care of their business in the city center.
The "living and diversifying public space" and the "attractive citizen taste" are an indication of the current restructuring of the Security Gate.
The goal is to make the area beauty and allow the Mosaic work of the Toll House to enjoy a better vision.
Besides the work, there is a square, and where the area is well at the sun, it is considered suitable as a dwelling area for passengers.
The artwork will be highlighted, and the material will now enjoy better than before on this 142 square meters [142 m] surface.
In the area, there are also small “smooth sprays, ” some kind of water sulphurs, offering up and providing the region with certain mysteries.
In this way, the repairs are described by Reykjavík City, which is being implemented in combination with Vetten.
Water plants, heaters and electrical devices will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their ages, but the school plans and the cold waters have served residents and businesses in the center of towns in less than a century.
When the gate is reopened at the end, cars can drive around it again.
However, it becomes a single pathway, and at the same time it creates more quiet and accessible space for the running.
According to the information on the customs house on the Internet of the customs manager, the house was used in 1971, its architect was Gísli Halldór’s son.
Because sea shortages reached through the house, there were 250 square meters of windowless wallpapers.
The Building Committee and Architects agreed that such a flat would have a bad effect on the overall portfolio, unless special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
Participants therefore agreed to calculate the establishment of a permanent artwork.
At that time, the summary says a lot of words of the Magistrate’s daughter, Gerth.
If she had worked a lot with Mosaic artwork in Germany and elsewhere.
It was intended to contact her first before it was decided whether it would be possible to compete for the job.
It had often been discussed that the work would have to reflect life at the port, since the port had been a lifelife of Reykjavík since it was made.
When she was discussed with her artistic woman, she became a trax of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals from abroad.
The time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she presented some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the job.
In addition, the Brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them in the setting up of a wide range of artworks, was requested to make a whole contract with her and the famous artwork company in Germany.
Contracts concluded, and Gered worked the artwork under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation of the Tollhouse.
All the work was very well done, both by the Dog of the Holy daughter and by the Brothers of Oids, says the Summary.
Since then, it has endured an unpleasant islandic weather.
It took Gerd for two years to do the work that was done and set up in the years 1972 and 1973.
Two years after the customs work was completed, only 47 years old, the female woman died.
Preparing the transport of other sources to land
Assmundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be brought to land in the next place.
This was what a minister in the section of explosion on the Wave said this afternoon.
Recently, the burning area of the House and Human Agency was reported to be transported north of the Sheep Arc in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of burning work at the Agency, but none of them intends to follow the North Institute, and the National Association of Firefighting and Medical Transporters has criticised the transport of livestock.
“ I think we should take further steps in this being.
I'm preparing further steps in this being.
More transfers," said Ásmundur.
Is he convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see the greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of officials to the country, as I was doing with a House and a Human Agency,” said Ásmund, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and have been important to local communities, such as transportation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland's landmeters to Akraness and employment insurance on the Skaga Coast.
All the most important from the second day of the Master Congress
94. Iceland’s Master Meeting in Free Sports ended at the Thorfield of Akureyri today.
A number of contests were made on the second day of the competition.
It was calculated with an exciting race in the most exciting women on the Thorsfield, but Vigdis John’s daughter from FH set the Icelandic measurement in 2014, which stood until Elizabeth Ruth Runs daughter from IR added to May last year.
The Icelandic return rate has been in the last summer and has been in a fan form, but it has tribitalised the Icelandic estimate of some.
Elishabet Ruth has been dealing with injury and has not reached a strike today.
She had only one golden cast of five, throwing 25,69 feet [25,69 m], far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 feet [60.08 m] in her last attempt, and immediately set an assembly.
Her Icelandic measurement set earlier in July, 62.69 feet [62.69 m], however, was quite a bit from that.
Godron Karitas Hallgrím’s daughter from IR had the next day’s best cast, which added its best success with a throw of 50.18 feet [50.18 m].
In a man's group, Hilmar Örn Johannson, an Icelandic councillor, won a safe victory, but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last cast and set a contest.
His Icelandic measurement in this article is 75.26 feet [75.26 m].
The God of Val Godnason, Olympian, and Iceland in circumstance, worked in a bullet TV at the Thorfield yesterday, but today he competed in a circuit that is his main article.
The Icelandic measurement of the Gods Vals is 65.53 metres [65.53 m], which he threw at a maximum of 59.13 metres today and guaranteed its victory.
Valdimar Hjalth the son of Erlend was thrown for the next day, with one valid cast in the second seat, 49.43 feet [49.43 m].
Havdís Victory daughter, a long - long Icelandic meteorologist, won the long - long race with superiorities, but Hafdís jumped at a maximum of 6.25 meters today, which is less than 40 cm from its Icelandic measurement.
In the 200 metres of the women's race, it was the IR's God-saving Jonah Bearnadd, which was the most brightest, but she came to the target in 24,04 seconds, but her Iceland measurement in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Jonah’s God - delivered victory at Akureyri, who won two golden prizes yesterday, a 100 - meter - run and a 4 - x 100 - meter - tender race, and a 4 - 400 - meter - tender race today.
In a male group, Kolben Hague Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 metres of the race in 21,57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Oliver Monna Samuel's son from Årmann.
Like the God - saved Jonah, Kolbeen won Gold for 100 meters yesterday as well as the 400 meters of the race.
Do not get guilty for $27 million Bitcoin harvest
The Executive Committee has rejected the requirement of a tax investigator who claimed to be guilty over a man for unrecognition of its funding funds that had been made for sale of the Bitcoin electrical coin.
The term concludes that the tax investigator had not made clear reasons for the need to blame the man.
The Committee’s decision shows that the tax investigator considered the man to have places of material wrong tax statements due to the 2016 and 2017 financial years.
He would have mispronounced his financial funds that were in existence because of the electricity of Bitcoin up to 27 million, either willingly or by a magnificent ignorance.
Debt the man for his manner.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
But in 2016, he had sold an electrical coin for 27 million.
He would have been buried in the years 2009 and 2010 when such things were both easy and inexpensive with a normal home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electrical coin, taxation would have been very unclear and unpredictable for such sales.
It could not have been expected that public citizens would be aware of such arrangements on tax pronunciation.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the harvest and would have recognized his property on a statement as an incredible account.
He would have been asked by both experts and government tax managers about how this would be done but without success.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
Hence, he would have been in worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities had not made a clear view of.
Thus, the man thought that his taxes before these two accounting years would be redetermined and exposed to pressure, but in other words, they would not be punished.
Then he repeated that he was working in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to escape his duties in an unrequired way.
The requirement for guilt would be all the way and would throw him into debt.
“ This man understands what football is. ”
Andersen Willumsson's brewery has been considerable between the teeth of people, and it has also impressed the performance of its lifetime with the Breit Moment in the Pepsi Max department.
The lightning will be in the light line tonight when they receive IA on a direct broadcast on Stand 2 Sport.
Thus, a fountain will take out a ban because of four reminders during the season and will not come to play with new clips, as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, blah, blah" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“ I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but when talking about character, this one was better trying in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants the ball every time and if there was someone going to fix this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Godmunder Benedictts son in the Pepsi Max stick, when considered to be struggling to the Bryan.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
“ Sometimes it’s hard to realize what his position is.
He looks a little out on the left when it starts to suffer at the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said the Branch of the Marine Son.
Thorkel Monn Peterson says that Bryanjlf is a real entertainment force, and he rejoices to have such a colorful man in the branch: “No one disputes about this character.
This is a nice type and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There's incredibly a lot of people busy with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I’m a pleasure force.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with the Brown River, people are paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Måne.
Player KR says he wants to leave the company - "I've been in contact with some teams in the B department"
Tobias Thomsen, a player at the Pepsi Max, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his home country, but for that he must first quit his contract with KR, where the Danish department begins before that islandic likelihood.
The company knows that I miss Danmarks and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“I have been in contact with some teams in the B department and I will probably change before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract with KR."
Then he says that he is likely to have to take off a wage reduction in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
The bike whisperer Brightmar has recovered a bicycle for millions - now answered by the DV report
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leoson has been interested in other matters than most others.
He cleans up and saves lost and stolen wheels, electric wheels, and bags.
Have Brightmar gained the name “the whisperer ” for the course.
Yesterday, when a person published a report of his dealings with Brightness, he was so excited.
Then DV pointed to discussions on the Facebook group of Western Prayers, where it appeared that Brightmar took the man to speak in Eastern Vell and said that the bag might be stolen.
There was no other way to read from the original writings of the electric shooter but the fact that Brightmar taught him.
The text has now been modified on Facebook and the header of original news DV updated accordingly.
The original news about the matter does not describe what was really going on yesterday in the East.
Björtmar said that they have received information from the victims of electrical manipulators that they truly were their electroscopes.
The information was declared to be owned by others, but the information proved to be wrong, says Brightmar.
“ I saw the guy, and I knew about the ride, with information about a long - missing electrical cable, looking for it.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shuttle, I decided to stop talking to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I am very fine in such a matter, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken away my word."
Bearmar says that the man on the electrophone had likewise invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and had himself called to the police.
“ Yeah, great, ” said Brightmar, “we just get this clear. ”
Then the owner of the electrocute proved possession of his electrocute and went.
Later, as reported in the first news, the right owner of the electrical sheet told about his history on Facebook.
In this more than a year that Brightmar has spent time on this practice, he says he can count the times he encountered on the side of people on the fingers of another hand.
“ I have had peaceful dealings with the hardest men, ” said Starms, saying that bicycle thiefs are the most frequently smallest brothers and sisters of society, drugs, mentally dressed people, and other people who are somehow on the street.
“ Drug is a hard master, and at some point the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately, it is a easy way to get to that goal, ” says Brightness.
“ My dealings with these people are really so good that I have many of those good people with me.
There are examples of people who have been treated and then looked at me and helped me with what I am doing, ” he says.
In general, the relationship between Björtmar and riding bicycles is courteous.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle numbers, and so on.
Rail - wheel stealing is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Brightman says that even the police have started to point people to talk to him on stolen bikes.
Brightness is inconsistent with the previous DV news transfer and does not claim to be some kind of self-detested police in personal search for justice.
Asked if he wasn't yet at the throat of ice with his activity, and if this isn't the chief role of the police, "Bartmar surely is.
“Of course, the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not doing this.
I have to take a picture of the cops driving away from a big blow of stolen wheels.
She is purely declared unmainful in these matters."
“When the cops are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can achieve a success in this class of matters, why not?” says Brightness.
He claims that he has been so successful in having stolen wheels that he sometimes runs on his “refugees ” on the street that they only had the right Brighter wheels they had previously reached.
The times that Björtmar has called for police assistance have just made it uncomfortable.
“ It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owner of the bike to teach, ” said Brightmar and feels sorry that the victims of bicycle thief need to suffer from the emptyness of the police in this case class.
The success of Björtmar is not divided.
In many places there are stories of people thanking Brightness for getting back to their possessions.
Even says Brightman has long lost the number of bicycles he has delivered, but the amounts are naturally running on millions, if not millions of years.
Weigh heavy electrical cycles, electric wheels, and electric cycles, but cycles may cost less than half a million.
Brightness works at school on a day, and every weekend he works together.
His search for a bicycle is, therefore, an unpaid work that he is doing during his vacation.
Life Treasures and Long Shadows
In 2019, many years of birthday in Iceland’s history of treasures.
It is true that the officials had been retired from the King of Dana all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919, a treasure of officials was set up, which finally became the treasure of life of all officials.
The foundation for the current treasures of general payers was then placed in 1969 with a total army of nuclear contracts on the labour market, which was declared to be a job - making treasure with a duty and a fully valid asset from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were then laid down on the basis of these contracts, and the life - Earing system continued to grow after that.
The wage system was not the only radical change that the 20th - century work movement incurred by its nuclear fight.
Unemployment insurance had been provided in a similar way in 1955 in historical workshops, as well as gradually, the organisation received its requirements for sickness rights and sickness benefits, substantial leave rights, shortages of working time, improvements in housing, and more.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but, after thinking, proved to be much more and more lasting remedy than the increase in the yield surgery, which disappeared as hard as the inflammation of the period after war until 1990, as many remember.
The attraction to the organization of general treasures in 1969 was long and complex.
Eventually, even though the assets would be actually owned by a social society, the movement of the work force agreed that their governments would be assigned to representatives of professionals and social partners.
In the next few years after the fees ’ organization, the requirement for the majority of workers in the government of the fees often came to discussions in the organizations of the payee, but it never achieved, so we still have the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the social partners are not in the majority of the governments of the fees.
The 36th paragraph of the Law No 129/1997 on the obligation to ensure the rights of life and the functioning of livelihoods concerns the investment policy of the funds.
The first figure says that “the interests of the social partners must be guided by a treasure of life. ”
The 5th figure also states: “A treasure of life must set moral standards in investments. ”
The role of the shopper's Liquid Assembly includes the following regulations, following the abovementioned laws:
The Growth of Life is part of the United Nations Regulations (UN PRI) on responsible investments, along with many of the largest life-eyes and professionally established Western Sea and Europe.
The Rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues and on good governance of companies can contribute to improved investment results in the collection of investments.
In this way, the interests of investment and the goals of society are combined in a broader context.
The LV believes that it is important for partners, especially those registered on the market in shares, to adopt a public policy: to carry out a good governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Growth of Life, which has the largest resources in the country, has set a “policy for responsible investments, ” and there are similar regulations.
All of this is recalled here as the introduction to the latest fashion of the islandic word, “shadow management.”
Since the word is new in this matter, there is no hope that it has been defined at all, but the following definition now seems to be “the most taken”: Shadow Management is when a head of a class society says in the media that he is going to send the representatives of the Society in the management of a body of orders or instructions on how to take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be disfellowshipped at first suitability.
However, if the leader does not bring this into the media and does not speak of discouragement, it is not “shadow control, ” but, of course, communication between humans is always in the financial world like elsewhere.
I leave the reader to think about the way he feels “shadowed. ”
In particular, two men have tried to form this definition when it is written, in the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
They are the Hard Eggson journalist on the newspaper and the Adsgeir Johnson bankrupt.
The reason for both of them was after Bogi Nils Bogason, President of Icelandair, had told his intention to terminate the agreements of the company with airlines and pilots (say them up), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, President of the Reykjavík Commercial Society, then sent out the recommendations to the representatives of the Society in the government of the Lieutenants to not support the possible purchase of the fund on shares in the company, or they might be killed.
Sometime later, Bogi Nils pulled his decision back, and afterward, Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, of course with Boga’s decision.
Yet, they saw Heather and Ásgeir reason to discuss the matter in the Friday newspaper with great words about shadow management, violation of law, and a profound need for changes in law.
Indeed, there was a little dust to wonder about a heavy fool, although the blessed duw had been in a connection and was also quickly wiped out.
Since this matter is important, let us consider the matter at the end.
I was following the things in the laws on the treasure of life that are underlying this matter.
These include that civil governments should take care of social interests and have moral standards in investments, and these elements are implemented in detail in the agreements of both the value and the life sheet of shoppers, as I mentioned.
Yet, life’s treasures DO NOT only have to look at short - term losses in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and should not long be searched for such examples in the past, since large loans to banks and treasuries have become immoral adventures and environmental scenes, with disastrous consequences.
President Icelandair was obviously on the necks of ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus drasticly deducting the welfare that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position in relation to investments.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time reveals whether it is sufficient for the company to invest life - listening treasures to be responsible for civil society at the time of their rise.

One of the infected practices did not cause return
One of the three who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Eastern Kingdom on July 15, last, about one and a half weeks ago.
However, he is an Icelander who is not regularly settled here, so he was not given clear instructions on maintaining so - called home - to - home care after his arrival and taking another visualization several days after his arrival.
He received a negative discretion at the border.
“ But he is in the islandic community, ” says Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a specialist in the field of pollution at the Agricultural Medicine and a paramedic during his summer vacation, in conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English file format and there is no obligation to record the ID numbers and if the ID number is not recorded, you are not automatically proclaimed in the later display.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a foreign resident but because of his connection to the country as an Icelander, he should have used it rather.
But he did not realize this.
“ When the ID is not recorded, you need to seek it yourself in the second show.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that it was the right way," says Kamilla.
“ So it is clear that we need to promote the information gift about this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system, even though Icelanders do not record their ID numbers.
Or to make it somehow clearer who are participants in the islandic society in the registration system,” she explains.
Happyly, though, he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, the present Icelander.
Only six have been sent to sickness after he was diagnosed yesterday, and all these six were associating with him.
They are going to take a show, but two of them have started to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infected.
On July 15, the man received a negative demonstration at the border.
Kamilla is likely to say that he was recently infected by the virus that she was not yet able to identify it when the vision was accepted by the border.
However, she does not want to exclude the man from being infected here in Iceland but not carrying the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that this is surely infected because it is long since he arrived in the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused little wars in connection with the sports conventions. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It is really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but it says that it cannot be excluded until the islandic genetic diagnosis has been ranked in the man.
“If we get a virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost sure that it has brought it to the country. ”
Pipar sprays and bombs directed against Protestants
Tonight, there was a fight between police and Protestants in Seattle.
The police used piparsprey and immortal hand bombs, but the Protestants broke down and turned on.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 policemen were hurt.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested last night in the United States, but protests in Seattle were supported by Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As on BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people met in peaceful protests.
Then, a group of people turned on in a building area and broke a bar in the city’s courthouse.
After that, the police said that protests were disturbed, and there were conflicts between Protestants and police.
The demand for justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by the police in August last year, remembered by Protestants.
A car was driven through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was hurt.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of national guardians gathered together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in her home in March last year.
The group carried weapons and joined arms at closed gate gates, where the police are responsible for the group of protesters and also carrying weapons.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, football inspector Manchester United, does not want to do too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today at the final round of the English Division.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, the end of the sunshine and his men in the 5th seat, and thereby lose the Master's seat.
However, they should still hope to come to the Master Department by working the European Department next month.
“ We haven’t been in line.
If we get a step against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad time now," said Solskär.
“ Whatever happens then, this is not the end of our journey, for we still have a considerable place in land by reaching the two teams above us, ” said Solskär.
It is evident that human nervousness becomes twenty - fifteen today, but Solskær tried to pretend that each other game was at stake.
“ If you want to be part of Manchester United, you must get used to being under pressure during the last game of the period.
It's nothing new, and it's based on the company.
We've prepared a great opportunity to end the period well, and now it's ours to use it," said Solskjær.
“ This is not the most important game of the period, it is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The end does not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“ The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed greatly for us, and I believe that we are in a better shape and are much stronger spiritually than in the last period, ” said Solskjær.
65.000 infected sun rings
65.490 new chronic viruses were reported yesterday in the United States, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4.178.021 infections have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
The virus killed 900 yesterday, but the last four days until that, more than 1,000 a day, were killed by the virus.
A total of 146.460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to the prophecy of the United States, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000, August 15, next.
Fear the Second Wave of the Epidemic
Spain's governments are now trying to refrain from the increase in COVID 19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day since the beginning of May, and the reports are coming at the same time as Spain starts to abolish one of the most stringent exit bans in Europe.
The relapse led to the British authorities now to commit passengers from Spain to be infected when they returned.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The worst situation in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain is where governments have taken wider limitations to try to match the growth rate.
In the capital of Barselóna, the next two weeks of entertainment will be closed, and the halls will be closed at midnight.
This is now valid for 200 thousand people in Segria County in the western part of Catalonia.
Britain’s decision is believed to have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is much relying on the coming of foreign tourists and is badly played after the epidemic.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel office, cancelled all the flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Worldwide governments are said to prepare themselves for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be to take back to a large expansion ban that has destroyed the economy in many places.
For example, the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has miserablely treated such things as nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
In that case, France’s Prime Minister Jean Castex said that the nation “will not survive, financially or socially, ” if again the country’s ban would be taken.
Many advisors hope that local arrays that will reach the inhabitants of the local towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to stop the virus in the next traffic if they arrive.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Three domestic infections were identified yesterday, plus two more than the border.
Thus five subjects with positive Covid-19 infections were identified yesterday in Iceland.
According to the public health report, one infection was associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football consignment.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen who have been in close association with him in an infectious state.
The infected person participated in the social work of a sports community in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, “only part of the athlete” in disease.
Others who were dispatched in an infectious state were in another way associated with the man.
The origin of these pollutions is unfound and infected in full-time by the State Police Officer.
ReyCUP Congress Meeting holders have followed the instructions and regulations of the physician and general healthcare that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the convention brought attention, which could be seen in very close association to celebrate the good course of their teams in the field.
Right before 11 a.m. today, the contesters published the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says: “Parently, parents respect the rules of picking up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding."
Another infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported this morning.
Says in the notification: “Islandian genetic analysis has seen the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
Infectious infectious effects are also carried out in isolation and 12 in infectious diseases due to the infection.
The third infected infection was from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
The one is now in isolation and six who were in close association with him in an infectious state.
Two of them have already shown symptoms of virus infection.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border and were waited for further studies such as a process of infected borders.
Eventually, the report says: The General Police Office and the physician officials urge people to be careful and careful about individual infectious agents.
There is no doubt whether the signs of the virus are present, the same one is asked to take a show at the next healthcare station.
Patch feather says the tent area booked about shopper sanctuary - Beyond guests else
This weekend, as announced by the Western Palestinian, will be fully booked.
It is indicated that guests should consider other possibilities.
It is called the West - built Valley, the Valley of the Valley, the Melanes of the Red - Say, the Hotel of Komokalund, and the Hotel of Great Britain as other options in the position.
There is enough to be on this weekend’s patriotic feast, for as in the past year, Skjoldstadt, a celebration of Icelandic records will be held in town.
Since 2007, it has become a stronger tradition in the town.
The request for judgment in the tent area can be expected to meet this year, if weather does not take account, but DV said earlier today about a descendant prophecy.
However, may the worst weather be expected southward, and hope for patch feasts.
The web bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already booked.
A whole multitude grooves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free of charge on Dunhaga 18-20.
As long as owners seek reconstruction permits, their business has succeeded in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest, and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavík City, there is a magnificent multitude on three heights.
On the grounds of the house, there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
At the back of the house, the door is two stages, each containing four pretty beautiful apartments.
Are they between 93 and 130 square meters, although most of them exceed 100.
The house has a considerable story to be stored.
It was built in 1959, including video rents, the Skostof, the Milk Sales Hall, Joa’s gunshop, fish sales, and now the last University paper.
The house has, as a matter of mind, remembered its fistish beauty.
As you can see in the following pictures, the house is now under much damage.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are, according to the company register, Magnus Magnus son and Godron Helga Lárus daughter.
Magnus went for the ownership of Payment and was the defendant of the Ownership of Payment.
A group of the owners of the Payment Society is a Steelship.
Steelships are an investment company of Godrua Lárus' daughter and her children.
Godron is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Godron and her husband, August Godmundur, the son of Sigurd, once ran out the steel ship.
D18 etc. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so there has been little and nothing since then.
Tell neighbors that the situation of the house has worsened ever since, though most recently.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood, one inhabitant says that the house “was not particularly vital last years. ”
It may be a matter of the fact that owners have been trying to change the house and place for a few years.
Other neighbors say that the house has long not been okay.
“ It’s long time to do something generally with this spot and boring that this has been pulled like that. ”
He also says that he is filled with the owners of the house because he has not done this, found a common flat with the neighbors of the house, and quit this “advocate step. ”
“Do this just in consultation with the community around so that it can be done and completed.”
The legal patch that the people refers to is the organisation process of the field which has been running at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were requested to build a height above the current multitude and behind the house, a new elevator and a building on one height, plus a basement.
The Building Authorisation granted for this implementation was declared to the Committee on Environment and Resources, and the Committee disregarded it in the absence of support for the Committee on External Relations and Disclosure was not satisfactory.
In July last year, Reykjavík City started a divisional work and completed it with an advertising in the Governance News.
It was also declared and defeated by the Committee in March 2020.
Thus, at this time, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permit and owners of the house at the starting point.
At that time, the house had fallen considerably, and the neighbors were tired.
When DV asked the neighbors into the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in a number of ways.
Some had an understanding of the purposes of the house owners, and others did not.
Others directed anger to the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but they didn't necessarily get into anyone.
Others said that the parking lot was a twist, but neighbors have used the unused parking space of Dunhaga 18 to 20 under their drive.
One complainant said long - suffering in the government:
“ That we have to go through the process for a three - year period is quite incredible.
It's like the city of Reykjavík couldn't read."
Today the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
Remembrance of the city’s phases of governance and the precious intents of owners and of the many years of work that are now on the starting point.
When a newspaperer had a garden in Dunhaga 18, he was blown with a galoped door and a garbage.
Playstation computers and recent television were inside another waste on earth — victims of Icelandic Summer Battle.
It was opened into the old office of the University paper, where a lot of cats of the smell were sentenced.
Obviously, somebody has turned around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pieces of thermical magazine pages, which were likely to be a book, were revelated.
The stairways of the apartment were also open as well as lives in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to meet the inhabitants of one of them.
There, the Romanians were buying potatoes for dinner and invited a journalist.
The Romanians are working for the Ztrongforce hire.
They have been there for some time and simulated DV’s sources that the company has paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it does not seem defensible to get a rent.
Of the posts in the door of the house to judge, it is evident that there have been a number of foreign people living in the last misfortune.
The business of employees has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, with the fact that a collaboration of tourists leads to the collaboration of the building and these two industries are the most effective to take advantage of the service of employees.
Yet, homemen in Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do and hung the jobs and hosts in the property to dry after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the bad condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist criticized the boys in bed, he suddenly became clear of the irony: At the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of property is downstairs.
Owners want to change the house to improve, and neighbors want to improve the situation, but argue about the definition of “rewards”.
Between the city's organisational area at the starting point, the victims of endless prosecution paths and the organisation process and the phases of the Committee on the Environment and Resources.
So, in the house, bedden workers live, perhaps those who are going to improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the DV July 17th.
To fight against overweight following chronic antiviral age
Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on announcements of suspendiness, as a result of his serious illness, partly due to his weight.
At present, Johnson presents the campaign called Better Health tomorrow, Monday, but the campaign encourages physicians to prescribe cycling to their refugees in overweight and will be attacked in the fight against the increase in cycling racing.
Then, according to the sources of British media, advertisements on television will be banned at 21 o’clock.
“COVID-19 has raised us with short- and long-term risks of overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use time to become healthy, effective and eating healthy food,” according to the spokesman of governments.
Johnson himself had a gravity problem to combat, but he was imposed on care when he was infected by the chronic virus in the spring, and is partly to his weight because he is considered to have been so seriously weakened.
Women’s ability to lead the changes
She said that the new governance was the largest step that the nation could take to increase its power, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the overall interests.
“ We need to change a little bit now, and who is better able to lead such changes than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
"There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their female union.
To stand together and to be together to make changes.
So now we're just about to lead these changes."
Said she was a little distressing about the emphasis in Iceland that “best in the world ” in both gender and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to consider what to do.
Like Germans, they are very aware of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from, knowing the story and listening.
Listen to the voices of adjacent groups.
We don't all have the same rules here," said Helga.
She said that women were in many ways in good matters in Iceland, but added that, as in many other parts, Iceland has a huge male value.
She said that politics were about to form their own interests, authority, and powers that were the forces that maintained wrongs in all society.
“ Women have now set up this group and have gathered together and have just become a little irritated about the fact that the General will move to overlook this 2012 national vote, ” she said.
“ It’s these female values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and protection, cooperation and the fact that we are all really at the same level," she added that the abovementioned values are the basic values of the new Governing System.
“ We are a very rich land of natural humility, and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently," said Helga.
“ It is ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s jobs are always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that airlines and nurses have to stand in a nuclear struggle forever just to achieve human pay."
The signature list of the new management file can be signed through electronic Iceland.

The house in which the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his training is now available on the Airbnb page.
The next free nights in the house are about the merchant saints.
The house is small and rude, located in the town of Givenry, Normandy, France.

Infectious tigers and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the chronic virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with the inland chronic virus and most of the infected are unconnected.
Tigers have been infected because of this, and some of them begin to show the symptoms of the virus.
Yesterday, three were diagnosed with the inland chronic virus and two at the borders.
A specialist in the physician’s office notes that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading to the community.
“ There has been a series from the former domestic infection, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to think it has been hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that's just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Camilla Sigridur Joseph's daughter, a specialist in the field of pesticides of the official physician.
Most of those infected have been associated with individuals from abroad.
More synthetics occur in the next place than some who were in association with the infected people have started to show the symptoms of the chronic virus.
“ Now there is no influenza and less than other respiratory infections, so we can be somewhat free to do these tests on individuals who had found reason to do something else first at the time of influenza, ” said Kamilla.
Infectious toxicity is mainly completed but is not excluded from the need for other infectious substances.
Two infected people were diagnosed after they had been attracted to sports events.
Has it raised questions about whether such events can be defended?
As long as people comply with standards and regulations, the general communicator will slowly say so.
Kamilla almost notes that the infected people were infected at sports conventions.
“ If no more isolates from these individuals after having been with them at these sports conventions, we can claim that our infections at the conventions have worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
The General Protection Office's Prosecution is in constant review.
“ We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems appropriate, ” said Kamilla.
After a more than a week, multi - data markets will be extended to a thousand people.
This new situation may affect suggestions.
"Setting thoughts about cooking" - See Elisa Vedar's meal note
Elisa Vidars daughter is a sportsman who plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrients, mothers, and serves as a food scientist.
It requires great energy for the day’s service and usually takes time to cook good and nourishing food.
A regular day with me begins to come to work up from eight," says Elizabeth.
“ After work, I go to the shop to prepare for dinner before I get my girl to school at 3:00. ”
Elisha feels very nourishing to get her daughter early at school.

After exercise, it is good to come home and just have to warm up your food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to look at one part to clear the mind."
Elisha does not follow a certain diet.
As a result, she is doing a master design in nutrition and knows what it is suitable to eat to have enough energy to care for work, school, family, and exercises.
“ What fits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, hydrocarbons, and fat.
However, I think it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nourishing, or nourishment.
It's in fact all right to eat everything, just not everything at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel some thoughts about cooking in the kitchen, so I get a lot of money.
I have to say that self-confidence is with me in the kitchen, and I really believe that I am a good cook."

Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities of Seattle, Washington, have declared rebellion as a result of numerous protests in the city.
Yesterday, the police took a bloss - explosion and pepper spray to try to ruin a large area that Protestants embraced and stretched over many houselengths in the neighborhood of the city’s district.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that a study was conducted at the police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bombing.
Civil and police authorities say that Protestants stoned police with stones, bottles, bombs, and other loose bombs, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where he was injured.
However, the protest in Seattle was peaceful for a long time.
They were invited to show Protestants in Portland, Oregon, who have repeatedly encountered a tough fight between Protestants and the depressed federal police.
There, like in other cities of the United States, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter, remember George Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis 25 May, resists a systematic racism in a American community and demands an extension.
Not revoked until after vote payment
It is not yet possible that the flight miss Icelandair, which is to take effect at the next month's convention, will be revoked.
A Electronic vote on the Icelandic Air Force Company's Air Force Contract will be concluded on noon tomorrow.
Godly Lieutenant Liney John’s daughter, President of the Society, is assured that Icelandair will not make a decision on the statements until the conclusions of the vote fee are made.
“ This is closely linked, ” says Godlaugh Líney.
“ There have been no withdrawal; this must be done so that the machines can be made available.
So, of course, people are uncomfortable after getting to know if they're going to work after the month's meetings."
The choosing of a contract signed before the week, on July 19th.
It is expected to be valued until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract previously agreed by airlines.
On 17 July, the Icelandic Government and Confidential Council agreed to proclaim an Icelandair General Labour Station, which was approved by the social partners in a vote fee.
To her never came, but this was decided after Icelandair's decision to stop talking to the Air Force Society, quit all of her airline maids and look for contracts with another class.
Then the pilots of the Society were to take up the work of security teams on board temporarily.
Asking how she believes that the vote will go, God - lying Líney finds it difficult to say about it.
“ People are hurt after this operation of Icelandair, when all the airlines of the Society were dismissed and announced that the deal would be with another class.
Now it shows whether it affects," she says.
At the end of April at Icelandair, 940 airmasters worked at the end of April, 900 of them, about 95%.
Their revelation is distinct with those who have the lowest working life in three months, and therefore ends during the monthly conventions of July-August.
This group includes about 90% of Icelandair airlines.
What does it take if the contract will not be accepted?
“ Then we wanted to continue our conversations with our companions.
With this contract, we meet Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the maids think they've gone too far."
A vote on the nuclear agreement will be concluded and Icelandair will present the second quarter tomorrow
A vote on a new nuclear agreement will end at 12 a.m. tomorrow.
The second quarter Icelandair report will also be published tomorrow, but temporary extermination results indicate that the company’s income has decreased by 85 per cent from the same period in the previous year.
A electronic vote on the airline agreement of the Icelandic Union and the Icelandair Association for the sake of employment began on Wednesday 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who may choose the contract are Icelandair’s employees who pay social expenses to the Air Force Society.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new nuclear agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday earlier, Icelandair had broken conversations with the company after the first vote agreement was collapseed at the beginning of July.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and airlines of the Society on Friday, but they were pulled back after a new nuclear contract was signed.
According to a new nuclear agreement, airlines need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic wage.
The contract applies until the year 2025, where the regulations of the pilots have been incorporated and the flight maid for how long to fly on one guard.
The agreement was introduced to FIFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, declaring many airmaids who were discussed by a news office about dissatisfaction because of the contract.
However, most people seemed to agree that it was necessary to accept the contract to keep FFI alive.
The Icelandair statement for the second quarter of the year will be presented tomorrow than the EBIT of the Society, its corporate income for financial teams and taxes, which, according to temporary export results, is negative about 100 to 110 million US dollars or about $15 billion.
Icelandair sent the Cup Palace a temporary calculation last Wednesday, where it stated that the company’s income had reached about $60 million on the fourth or $8.3 billion.
At the end of the fourth, the handheld money and its equivalent were about $154 million.
Icelandair is also aimed at offering the Society’s shares in August.
Icelandair is designed to complete contracts with 15 credit rats, governments and Boeing aircraft manufacturers before the end of a month before partial mission.
New types rather than new virus
“ New virus just means that this has been a person from abroad.
This is not something that has been malling here inland," says the superphysician of the National Hospital’s Infectious Disease Department, Már Kristján son, reports that the “new type of virus ” has been identified here in the country.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One who had been diagnosed had participated in the social work of a sports community at Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unfound and infectious.
Infectious infection was also diagnosed in individuals who arrived in the country on 15 July and are two who were associating with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then it was reported yesterday that infections related to infections reported tomorrow and after the Icelandic genetic analysis were observed “new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
Infection has been completed as a result of this infection.
Some mention that this virus is not a new virus, but is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new SARS-CoV-2 chronic virus.
It is more right to speak of a new type of virus than of a new type of virus.
Asking what it means and if it could say something about the beginning of another wave of the epidemic, Már says that as if there is a single case, it could be nothing more to do with it.
“If, however, there are inland cases that are not linked from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular type, then the conclusion [in the second wave] could be drawn, but it is early to support it,” explains Magr.
Happiness in the Hot Pot
Is the secret to the happiness of the Icelanders hidden in the hot pots?
BBC programmakers lead to the likeness of a fun video that throws light on the country's swimming pool and hot pot culture.
The Icelandic bathing population is special worldwide and it is claimed that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing places in each inhabitant.
The natural heat is its foundation, but also the tradition of dizziness here.
In 1940, children’s education was legal, but elderly citizens are also decisive to use the hot water to improve their health.
As a part of the country’s general welfare, traits are described as a fixed part.
Everybody in the pot is equal, regardless of the size and position.
With the mobile phones, people talk on personal notes about home and space or enjoy the appreciative power of water: meditate and load batterys of soul and body.
To get a hundred days in a election
Hundreds of days are until the Americans are electing and choosing their president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he's got to pick up the brick.
Joe Biden, the hoped leader of the Democratic Group, has a great country leadership of Trump, taken into account by the surveys.
According to a new study by the AAP, the number of Americans believes that the nation is wrong.
Similarly, Trump’s reaction to the world epidemic of the new crown virus is very hostile, and more Americans than before the President’s economic disadvantages are considered.
In detail, only two in ten Americans say that the United States is on the right path.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s epidemic reaction, and 48 percent say that he has maintained economically well.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January 67 percent.
According to the average number of FiveThirtyEight, Biden is followed 49.9 per cent in the country, but Trump 41.9 per cent.
Trump himself has attempted to draw attention from his performance to Biden’s epidemic, to promote so - called cultural disputes, and to proclaim policy that should turn to law and order.
However, Biden’s offer is an effort to keep attention to Trump and considers a great chance of bringing the victory out if the election is really about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Trump’s disadvantages also seem to come down to the Democrats of the Republican Group, fearing that the Democrats may even reach the majority of the U.S. Senatorial Department, which has so far been very excited.
In the days, Politico told us that they would remain comparable to the groups and offerers, and this is what the Republican group would be most disgusting for decades.
The area has been particularly bad in the 2016 Assembly and now it seems that this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the people of the districts to follow themselves, including by saying that he will become President Biden, will destroy the United States’ prosecutors and promote racial disputes.
Among other things, Trump has dropped a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase biodiversity.
Then he urged “wives ” to deploy the United States to read an article of the former assistant head of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the United States’ districts and took Trump under it.
“Bide will ruin your distants and the American dream.
I will keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The population of the United States is increasing and increasing.
According to the NPR, they are about half of the United States’ choosers.
Since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the offerer who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Unless in 2012, Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
Studies have shown that despite Trump’s assurance to the small majority in the districts of 2016, its consequences have been considerablely united.
Although there is a difference between the tests, Biden has been measured with some fifteen percent priorities to Trump in the last excursions.
Regis Philbin's dead
U.S. televisionman Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin served as a actress, part - manager, introducer, and singer for about six decades.
He is one of the most well-known people for the live! with Regis, with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Then he has controlled parts like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been most of an hour in the U.S. television and has received the recognition of this subject.
He received six Emmy prizes in his life and was totally appointed 37 times.
His family declares that Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of fellow workers, friends, and fans have reminded him of social media last day.
Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the walks?
After the final decision to postpone the Olympic Games, events that have only led to world wars until now, the President of the International Olympic Committee stated that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the walks, ” and was expected to refer there to the world epidemic of chronic viruses, which the world - built is now going through in a united way.
Yields have an additional year to prepare themselves, and Japan’s authorities will increase their costs because of the delay.
Yet, everyone keeps a lot of head ending.
When announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the site of the Olympic Games this year, the joy of the Japanese representatives was true.
They cryed and laughed at once, because Tokyo had requested to hold the 2016 plays, but it led to a lower feast for Rio, Brazil.
At this time, Tokyo City and Japan were in charge of the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24, until August 9, but have been delayed for years, starting on July 23, 2021, and ends on August 8.
If your moves are not able to continue, if the chronic virus is still too threatening, your moves will be stopped.
However, no one wants to think that thought to the end.
Olympics are not a normal athlete.
Nothing to save, the show should always be amazing and seek to top the last games.
The choice of a city for Olympics is based on the assessment of the election committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation is — the more likely it is to get the nose.
Tokyo spent $150 million in trying to keep the Olympic Games in 2016 or over $20 billion.
The second time, when visited by the shows in 2020, $75 million, approximately $10 billion, were placed in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo had the plays this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent $30 billion for the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the sea, compared to the cost of building Olympic villages, stadiums, and generally strengthening the country’s interior to manage such conventions, preparing them, and keeping their own plays.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Olympic Games in Tokyo, which should have been ongoing these days but have been postponed for one year because of the chronic virus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report from a government revisor in Japan, published at the end of last year, revealed that the cost was nearly double that number.
It is unlikely that the cost of delaying games will not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated to cost between two and six billion more than the original cost.
Thus, the total cost of the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between $15 billion and $30 billion.
It is so high that all the taxes of the Icelandic State were only due to some half of the Olympic Games, depending on the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are events of the size that they have often become an audience to economicists, who are trying to examine figures and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, it seems that many have concluded that the effects of the Olympic Games are less positive than the economics of those who hold them.
A short - term effect, for example, increases in jobs to a short period of time, but for a longer period, cities often sit up with debts and threatening business costs of low - used manufacturers.
Rio, Brazil, has a lot of debt because of the 2016 plays and has been in trouble with maintaining all the large sports activities built for the plays.
According to the London 2012 plays, only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city have been unemployed before.
This means that it was not about new jobs unless in a small way.
In general, cities have not been particularly good for the economicity of the Olympics because of the disadvantaged costs of the human works built for the plays.
However, benefits are often included in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic Citys following the games, which, however, is very uncertain about the 2021 plays.
It is also uncertain whether all the audiences that usually go to the plays can be accepted.
However, the main issue is the honor that the cities may be chosen, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy of the games is not the nature of prizeing it.
However, although the show is often magnificent and nowhere is saved, it is not just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the forefront.
For some successors, it is surprisingly welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five - year - old woman and a gold - payer in her article on the page of Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, has been a casolete and would have been far away from the fun in some but is the hope of being a contest for the 2021 plays.
It is, therefore, among the sportsmen who are just quite happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who intend to stop after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, in some cases, the delay of the games means that they stop the race before the games take place.
Just don’t trust his body to go through years in addition to severe exercises.
A few athletes were as thorough in the hearts of audiences at the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 as well as Simone Biles ’ sports star.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has recently met in some interviews in his home country in the United States to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to the 2021 plays, but she doesn't necessarily know that she'll be at the top of the games in the next year, and then she'll be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered hair age, it is in higher order for a chief woman in the first place.
“This is a sensitive matter,” says Biles, but in an interview published on the Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, Biles smiles to another question asked whether it was going to reach the 2021 games as long as it did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’m still on the top after a whole year, ” says Biles.
She has previously spoken that her body is unable to endure the stress that follows sports training much longer.
Yet, she is busy practicing the Olympics in 2021.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly stop practicing when the world epidemic was at the highest level and the sports hall was closed.
It was no exception for Biles rather than for others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic Gold couldn't buy any access beyond the other, she had to find some ways to remain in shape as others.
Surely, the basic form is somewhat better than in most people.
“We have a stiff plan now.
It was hard to start practicing first after the sports hall opened.
We started slowly, but we're back in full, and I'm going to increase my exercises constantly afterwards.
Of course, we do not know exactly what these games are going to be, or whether they are being held, but we are practicing, even though we can’t do anything else.
I've been too busy to leave the sport now," says Biles.
Like many others, it may be anticipated, or perhaps rather conscious of the fact that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Foretelling that, however, is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the chronic virus will be in July 2021 and nothing but preparing for the Olympics in the year.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be the light at the end of the Covid gangs.
Deferred Marriage Due to Epidemia
The modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the chronic virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette contester Wells Adams this summer.
“ I think there are other more important things to think about accurate now, ” said the actress in conversation with People.
“ We would like to marry sometime, we would like to have the dream wedding and all the attendants we love.
But we decided to take this time and focus on what is important now, and it is to help share information about the importance of being with masks and staying at home.
I look more at world issues than the weddings of these days.
There are many things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world."
