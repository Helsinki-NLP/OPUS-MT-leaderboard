Mamming: Corona Mass Infection: 174 Harvesting Helpers Specified
After a Corona Mass Infection on a large vegetable farm in the Bavarian Mamming, almost 500 people are under quarantines and are no longer allowed to leave the operation.
A security service monitors the procurement.
A total of 174 harvest assistants were tested positively on the Corona-Agency Sars-CoV-2, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau Board on Saturday night.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we must, unfortunately, take this step to protect the population," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows soil bears, gurkes, coal and red beet - but only for enclosure glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep quiet: "After our information, it is a closed circuit of persons."
In the court infected by uninfected employees were separated, the site is now surrounded by a restraint.
Greens and SPD gave the government co-responsibilities.
The two opposition fractions were president Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet proposing to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly revenge if such local infections have to be taken out and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "We already demanded a special control programme for farmers with harvest helpers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof Slaughterhof Mitte Mai," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Just the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be closely controlled from our viewpoint.
This has obviously not happened."
The outbreak has come "with announcement".

Report: Seehofer calls for longer stock data storage
Storage of stock data is currently suspended.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer, however, calls for a media report to extend the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extension of stock data storage after a media report - instead of the 10 weeks planned for a half year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Seehofer asked Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a rapid change in law.
Seehofer therefore wants to reinforce the measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "take urgently necessary adjustments in the law now", the newspaper quotes from the letter.
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
It is expected that the EAGGF will decide on this.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, says the report.
A speaker of the Ministry of Justice said to the newspaper that it could only be reasonably checked whether legal adjustments were necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the internal ministers of the countries had already spoken for storage of stock data in June.

The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (an other Strip Club in Atlanta, Anm. d.R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that NBA Williams had ordained a ten-day quarantine.
Thus the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.

Southerly speaks after mass infection to the Corona site
Munich - Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced on Sunday a therapy for large farms.
The press conference will be seen live on our website.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has scared authorities and politics.
The large vegetable farm is currently working nearly 500 harvest helpers from several countries, more than one third has been infected with the Corona agent.
The court is now under quarantines and is locked with a building town.
No one may leave the site, food is supplied.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since harvest helpers had little contact with the local population, the Council of Country has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"conscience bites": confession of the suspected brandmaker of Nantes
"My Mandant has shown itself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defendant added: "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a deliverance for him."
His mandate was "puffed by conscience bites and very much included in the extent of destruction".
In the case of a condemnation, the man is threatened, according to state prosecution, to ten years of prison and a penalty penalty of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic Sankt Peter and Paul cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in the night on Saturday last week in a fire.
The fire had broken out in three remote places in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspect of burning.
The suspect who was now imprisoned had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the morning of the fire.
Since there was no evidence of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the perspective of the detectives.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss, set conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission makes complete facts," said Grindel of the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the associations that can become dangerous at the best Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leipzigs.
In that respect, you do not come around the debate, whether it is not necessary to make associations who want to break into this Phalanx facilitate the integration of investors."
However, he doubts whether there is the willingness in the German football Liga to allow majority participations that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment scenes around the Federal Liga in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB-Chef sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Federal League will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level but not lead to more excitement in the championship".
Even the equilibrium of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are immense only among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this error and crossed the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the adoption of a expensive watch that led to his retirement in April 2019.
"I'm already very busy with this people."
The gift in value of approximately 11,000 euros had been received by a Ukrainian functionary.
"I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences of it," said Grindel.
"I've been completely transparent and innocent with the unreasonable watch gift.
A lot of people in the DFB knew of it."
He never "made a hole out of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, anyway, this form of transparency was the entire opposite of corruption."

She announced that after several years of break in 2021 a Rakoczy riding tournament should also take place again.

Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine to continue his cycling career.

Argentina rejects the counterfeit of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible but also unfair," said a statement.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer liable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on private creditors to refrain from part of their claims of approximately 66 billion US dollars (approximately EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state's plea.
It would be the ninth payment failure in the Argentine history.
Lastly, creditors had demanded higher interest rates on public bonds and changes in certain contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government is holding its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The last inflation rate was over 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid a rate of 503 million US dollars and was thus declined into a limited payment failure.
Occupationally arrived - not yet private
"It's going super good" - this facility draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very fast: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will enter the succession of Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notariats.
Six weeks later, early July, the promoviered jurisdiction took up the work, the normal daily business is running long on full tours.
"Privately, however, I have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler advertising and laughing.
The short preliminary period has, of course, not been enough to transfer the food point of Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the bored Dingolfingerin.
At present, she and her husband, who serves as judges at the court of the land, are looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental time to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to need to pendle from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has a night's stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Of course, grown up in the neighboring country, the city of Eggenfelden has long been a concept.
When she visited on-site with her family in the past months, she recently discovered: "Eggenfelden is a pretty small town."
So, she was more pleased that she had made the race in the selection procedure around the free body.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's vocational course, her hometown of Niederbayern plays a key role: After the law study in Pasau, she completed her reference period and the second State degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as a note-race-sorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - in this time, she also trained the promotion in working law - she entered her first place as a noteholder in Rotthalmünster in the area of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went into parental age, followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notariats.
When the body in Eggenfelden was awarded for Lutz Feller's nearing retirement, it saw the right time for the full professional return, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the Notariats office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has prepared a commendation for the crew of the Office: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In children's gardens, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to check her hobby soon here - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Red Valley.
BVB plans for league start with a maximum of 15.000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football city in Dortmund will not be filled for seasonal start in the event of a fan return to 20 percent.
"Due to the distant system that is forced to comply, we plan the current position with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmund's manager Carsten Cramer the "day mirror".
Normally, the arena in the district city at Bundesliga games takes a little more than 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona Pandemic in the past season, the BVB per party had lost around four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation of the BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal audiences, some of the 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "There is obviously a battle in the office when these revenues are completely disappeared."
In view of the persistent Corona crisis, all of us are currently "advised to take a stable side-long first".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," said Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chef commended the BVB professionals for their salary deficiency, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary absence has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work."
Small wonders: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Nearly heavyer than a packer butter, just once three dining spoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he wooged exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 mornings that are taken care of every year at the Grazer Children’s Hospital.
One quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestine, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so small that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini winds for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with the voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger smelts.
"Of, of course, if they don't scream as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes stage
Despite the Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage, the 9th classes of the Sankt Jakobus gymnasium in Abtsgmünd even before the beginning of the vacation.

Afterwards, the students were able to exchange by Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and the performance.
Born was the idea for the performance format from the current Corona Situation.
The teacher Teresa Nar welcomed the enrichment of the teaching.
Although at the end all the stakeholders agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would still provide additional excitement, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting supplement to the game business," stressed director Winfried Tobias.

The film studio Warner Brothers took her for seven years under contract and brought her out on the side of Erol Flynn.
Eight films turned her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Each His Own".
The film ran in Germany under the title "Motherheart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
A lot of recognition was also given her as a neurotic excentric in "The Dark mirror" and "The Snake Grip".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the main role in filming her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The piece became a global success.
With her long-year-old friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiggen song for a body".
From marriage with writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son of Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had Gisèle's daughter with him.
This marriage also broke.
Yet, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler missed Final at Comeback
The WM second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the Beachvolleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the Top Teams in Düsseldorf, they subjected their national teams Nils Ehlers and Lars Flygen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Recently, Thole/Wickler had played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.

Kalbitz-Rudf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Figenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "five sheet" from the FDP and does not change the character of the party.
"AfD is the parliamentary arm of legal extremities in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiation, the afd federal arbitration court confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided mostly in May.
Kalbitz is the Chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburger Landtag.
"If it would really be about removing legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and its followers would long have been excluded," said Strasser.
"There is no political will in the AfD, however, because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blome said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz remains excluded now says nothing and doesn't change," he said "the world on Sunday".
"It says, rather, how many Frenetic supporters still have a legal extremer in the middle of AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will return to less than five percent in the future in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the voting leaders of the officially dissolved "flies" around the Thüringer AfD-Landes- and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection emphasizes the strain as a "safe legal extremist strain".
In May, the AfD Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned legal "Hemmattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz is involved in membership in the HDJ.
The President of the Left Fraction in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesscheidedgericht does not change the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has eaten only creams.
The AfD remains a right-extreme party, whether with or without Kalbitz."
This decision will neither weaken the Bundespartei nor the right wings.
"The manöver of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
You want to avoid a further observation by constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not lose the ghosts she called.
There's nothing to change," commented Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD Country Association and the Group held up to this day as their right leader."
The legal controversy about the membership of Kalbitz in AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now act civilianly against the decision of the Bundesrichtshof.
North Sea wind parks deliver about 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year 11,51 terawatt hours, the wind power stations on the German North Sea have injected electricity into the network.
This is about 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet informed in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea power to the mainland and the transit through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the tennet network, have fought in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
In total, the wind flow from the North and East Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Thus, the wind harvest on the lake is almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind parks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy has been made in addition to the wind conditions of higher production capacity, because in the past twelve months new wind parks have gone to the network.
If the 1270 wind power stations in the North Sea would all run at the same time with full power, they could generate calculating 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transfer capacity is sufficient for it, according to Tennet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
By 2030, it will rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not exhaust their capacity on the sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea Wind Parks produced more than six gigawatt electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, corresponding to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the Gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary to 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with the work of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual frame after the Corona break.

North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" engaged.
Freital: Windberg Festival cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital abandoned the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in consciousness of how difficult it is for the stakeholders - hoped until the last minute," explained Oberbürgermeister Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But finally we are responsible here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands had been streamed to the site and into the tent, minimum distances, hygiene rules and contact follow-up could not be respected in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that a people's festival wouldn't have left much.
In addition, organisational and monitoring efforts would rise by a proportional increase.
Rumberg trusted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressure olympics valueh not to beat in axis
Achleiten - The six-time olympic wizard Isabell Werth was the superior rider at the Dressur tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories at four starts in the weekend.

The last of the three international tournaments is planned there for August 14 to 16.
Further flight lots in Worms
The Worms University continues: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" creates a professor for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professional, there is the possibility to allow the start of the study not only in the summer, but also for the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, both at the university and at the DFS Air Safety Academy, the capacity is equally exhausted.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of professionals.
Representation at the university since 2019
Since summer semester 2019, the first students have been trained to fly at the Worms University in the course of Air Traffic Management.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lotsing training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the lots' profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy economically.
However, we are expecting that air traffic will be recovered and that it will grow on the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal task in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professor is a future-safety investment that will provide passengers with a wide, technically cross-sectional knowledge base on the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and simultaneously support our attractiveness as employers."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University: "The Foundation professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her, we want to connect to the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practice partner for the dual Bachelor study course Air Traffic Management".
Confidence of the German air navigation security is at the same time for Worm's university motivation and commitment to further expand their teaching and research skills in the future fields of air transport.
In the use of tomorrow's pilots, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual study could set very special highlights and innovative focuses for their students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air traffic, has a unique feature in Rheinland-Pfalz.
Today's signing of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the university profile."
Rescue hubs land on the A 45
About 30 minutes the motorway A 45 was fully locked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday morning, since after a traffic accident of the rescue hub screws was in use.
A 76-year-old drove straight out in the curve with a ford at 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau middle and landed at the lead board.
As a result, the frontair bags were triggered, the driver suffered mild injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old accompanyer were provided by the physician and the patient flew to a hospital afterwards with the rescue hub screw.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which resulted in an injury of approximately 2000 euros, had to be dropped.
Healing seeks to test other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis again revealed the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative enlargement is about to come.
But are they right - and will it remain there?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries in accordance with the now planned strict rules on misuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," said Heil, German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer is already warning that work contracts are generally restricted.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the meat-grey Tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
In the case of slaughter, slaughter, degradation and meat processing, large slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to use foreign staff.
This is intended to prohibit the use of work contractors and hire workers.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on work contracts and surrender of workers if you do not want to throw the economy completely away."
Work contracts, for example, are compulsory for large areas of craft, construction and construction, the basis for their value added to the customer.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban working contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to build up a security system, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat economy considers a ban on work contracts and lending alone in its industry to be constitutional.
It should not be explained why, in future, the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Sunday), the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" comments on a legislative project.
Thus, a ban would increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European workers from work contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW work protection management partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
The wages were included for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, "tricky constructions" had turned them around.
"Now we need to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Law, which we want to decide at the end of July in the Cabinet, there are also measures not only relating to the meat industry - for example, higher rates of testing in the protection of work or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The draft present contains amendments to the law on the safeguard of workers' rights in the meat industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I wish we could do more controls in many supervisory areas: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, more controls will also require more staff.
Three dead at the crash of Ultralight aircraft in Germany
When an ultra-light aircraft crashed to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people have died, according to the police.
A child has been easily injured.
Two more people had been saved in the accident, said a speaker of the circuit headquarters Wessel.
A fallscreen was found at the accident station, said the police.
The "Rheinian Post" reported, calling for eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane had collapsed with a hot air balloon.
The house was a single or two family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Rooming of Frankfurter Opernplatz peacefully run
One week after the excursions in Frankfurt, the rooming of the opera square will also be peaceful in the night on Sunday.
Recently, some dozens of people stayed on the place, but left him before the beginning of the locking hour at 1 o'clock.
Since the early evening, the police were in charge with numerous officials to see a larger police order throughout the city area.
The first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on the opera place on which there was a week ago crawling.

The night on Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overflows: Young woman in case of accident on the Federal Road 83 at Hofgeismar severely injured
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the Clinic Kassel.
With heat cameras, the fire force was looking for possible riders.
According to the police on the Federal Road 83, the woman was on the way to her home, when her car came out of unexplained cause from the railway and surrounded several times.
To save the accident, the fire force had to cut the roof of the truck.
Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was picked out from the rotator with a heat camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, also working with heat cameras, had been ordered for the search of persons.
However, the forces found no one between the high corn plants.
The injured person was brought with the rescue truck to the Kasseler Clinicum for further supply.
Almost 50 forces of the firearm Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was locked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redempting gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-fold world footballer made the total 36th Scudetto of the United History perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which was intruded without the last longly injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing out two play days before the end of the series A season.
The Table Second Inter Milan is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half time, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
A example of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penal room border directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) was dustged.
This guaranteed the shiny but decisive success.
The foulelf metre shot at the late in the 89th minute only Ronaldo itself should have been right in view of the tower-evaluation.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically for 90 minutes on ball height.
The games are strange, and the moment changes very easily," explained trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve-Coach.
Due to the defeat, the tourists had not yet been able to make the mastership perfect.
At the end, the predecessor at the table top was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had succeeded only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo is still going to be the king of Toraldo, it is questionable.
Since during the Portuguese superstar hit 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after its three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-fed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona has already 34 meetings on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title winning of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professor Gonzalo Haguaín.
The Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples season 2015/2016.
In August, the "Old Lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus stands at the Champions League's eight-finale, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon must wedge a 0:1 hint to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors
Stuttgart - Allen threatened punishments and judgments, despite that car drivers continue to give gas in numerous illegal races on the Baden-Werttembergic streets: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal authors in the southwest.
Comparative values for the previous years are not available, but the races are making the judicial authorities more and more work: In the state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, 155 investigation procedures were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until early June 151.
The races were less organised events, as the response from the Ministry of Interior to a question of the Landtag-SPD showed.
In most cases, the drivers would have suddenly attacked each other or they would have taken the refuge from the police - also that is shown as a illegal race.
In particular, German men aged between 18 and 60 were sitting at the tax.
113 penalties - 15 times penalty
In comparatively few cases, the Rasers are taken and also asked for the cash: According to the Ministry of Interior, there have been a total of 113 penalties since 2018 and 15 freedom penalties.
However, there are no evidence that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Instead, other car drivers responded more sensitively than before because of some tragic accidents and processes in recent years, and showed more frequently, said a ministerial speaker.
Particularly popular is the motorway 8. Always braking out the traffic there to provide space and to use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers near Kirchheim were taken under Teck, three months earlier, even 18 drivers at the A8 were at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
At the A81, the police register even more races than any other federal railway.
With a temporal limit there is attempted to bremse the breeder on the specially affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The most high-priced and excited sports and luxury carosses often have Swiss marks because drivers are avoiding the grass to Germany because of the high punishments for fast driving and authors in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the tempo limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general tempo limit of 130 hours, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD country-day fraction.
"The inhibitor threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you were not supposed to be legal here and there with 200 kilometres of hours and more on the way."
Rivoir has less information or image campaigns: "Whoever, in such a way, disregards all the rules and risks not only his own life but also the life of other transporters, is hardly attainable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police surveillance
On the other hand, the ADAC does not have enough: "We assume that Raser will not be disturbed by the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even harder checks on the routes concerned.
Uncommonly, the high-turnal power measure makes the painful and follow-up seriousness: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country died at the races, two of them unaffected at a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were supposed to have delivered a author.
One of the vehicles came off the street, robbed against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old accompanyer died.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, the internal minister Thomas Strobl considers that sharper penalties are not necessary: "The need for lawyers to act to harderly sanction illegal motor vehicle races is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of Interior.

Ackermann sprintes for the victory on the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Radprofi Pascal Ackermann fought his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer of the Bora-Hansgrohe team sat on the 109 km long section with start and destination in Hermannstadt in the mass print after he had won a stage already on Saturday.
It was the seasons three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall evaluation, his Austrian team companion Gregor Mühlberger went through.
The 26-year-old had decided the mountain time drive for himself on the morning and thus taken over the top of the classification.
Only 104 drivers had arrived at the final stage in the evening.
Not less than 18 launchers had fallen the time limit to the victim in mountains.
"I am really happy to start the season restart with a victory," said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
"The Sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.

During the complete tour, drivers and maintainers were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organisation team and from the media.
Viewers at start and destination were not allowed.

The fire defense speaker: "We're going out of a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nürnberg: Unauthorized Tuning-Treffen - Police attacks 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and more than 1,000 people took part in a "Tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
A large tuning meeting was held on Saturday night (25 July 2020) in Nuremberger Südstadt.
Several hundreds of vehicles were involved.

Illegales Tuning-Treffen in Nürnberg: only a small part from the "Szene"
The officials were at the top of about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, bilancing the police.
However, only a small part of these are assigned to the "autoposer" and toningsscene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scenes followed the police appeal.
On the basis of the local vehicles and persons, it should be assumed that this was mainly disclosed.
In addition, the major share of the attendants in the existing protection provisions of infection, in particular the compliance of the minimum distance and the carrying of a mouth-nasing protection, was maintained.
The on-the-spot control measures were completed at 1:00 p.m.
In total, the officials of 10 vehicles found such constructive changes that the operating permit had been excluded.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No author ends
Illegal authors haven't existed.
"The Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on the event and continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of discourses," said it.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the involved disposal company: "They have all beautiful fields we can't devour," said Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are broader, the company must be careful not to hurt any damage.
"Young people are finally supposed to get their cars back without any harm."
Numbers of the work agency: 900 suspect cases of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is according to its own statement about 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-working money.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short work," said the Board of Directors responsible for the operational business Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
As at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly requested very many companies short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
The test normally lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more precisely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a few more things.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse are often provided by the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software used to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency threshold in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are distinguished, but we are gunning for the case and are now training our employees in the work agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still unnoticable, said Terzenbach.

The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Massentests after Corona outbreak in Tourist City
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases grew to 48, as the national authorities in Linz reported.
More than 100 results remained in the evening.
Thus, many of the infected young practitioners have been tested in tourism businesses, but at least a holiday guest has been tested positively.
Inhabitants, guests and tourists were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The locking hour was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the director of the tourism association Wolfgangee, Hans Cursor, the dpa.

The Israeli police took a violent action against a demonstration against Benjamin Netanjahu, Head of the Legal Conservative Government, on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested because of disturbances, police speakers Micky Rosenfeld informed.
Among other things, the police used a watercaster to dissolve the advertising.
According to media reports on Saturday night, about 6000 people had gathered near Netanjahus office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahus dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters hit drums, bleached in horns, and called Netanjahu to retreat.
The news page "ynet" reported that there had been a counter-demonstration that supported Netanjahu had been arrested.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including before the private villa of the Head of Government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.

North Korea crosses border town to Corona suspect case
North Korea has so far seen a "lightful success" in its own defence measures.
Now the country reports a suspicion for the first time.
Due to a first official Corona suspect case in the country, North Korea has completely locked up a large city from fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been brought into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the distress has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion was confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the land of disposal.
North Korea has not registered any infection to date and has described its defence measures as "lighting success".
The data were doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms have been detected in the reports of a "excavator" who illegally crossed the military demarking line between South and North Korea on July 19th.
The person has gone to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mainly still compartments of military buffer zones, there was first no confirmation from South Korea.
However, the South Korean military, according to reports by the National News Agency Yonhap, admitted that the possibility of a illegal crossing to North Korea was high.
There were investigations on some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday, a urgent meeting of the Labour Party Police Office was called under the chair of power owner Kim Jong Un, because of the suspected case.
"The dangerous situation in Caesong could cause a fatal and devastating disaster."
Kim had already on Friday ordered as a preventive measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, were placed under quarantines.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to examine the "outturn" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Caesong.
Spanning before the Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still standing before a large summer break to discuss
"Apart from environmental topics, the members of the bodies will also vote on the Building Plan for the Large Project of Innenstadt Development-Oost", says it is rather occasionally in the middle part of the city press release to the next municipality meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 16.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the revaluation of the Eastern City is discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of the committees are almost, lastly in individual committees, even depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from the citizenship and then from the administration and municipality, is now not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized the project opponent Reinhard Klein as "except parliamentary opposition", "unrecognised", "speculation", "deliberation" and "conscious false statements".
"All think that it is better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipality for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizen List.
Actually, after reading the Treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will be cheaper for the city that the Technical Council House is against the statements of the city administration to grants of which the existence of Small is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than prognosising in the Council House and the promoters from the economy.
To design the city by its own power and not by an investor: this is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also mainly provides for the rehabilitation of the Technical Councilhouse, the openkeeping of the Slotberg, the rental of the ex-tale for administrative areas and a smaller central city rehabilitation in ideal case with local institutions.
Environmental themes play a key role
In addition, environmental issues will play a key role.
Thus, the municipality will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect Pforzheimer's population from healthy noise burdens caused by road traffic, including frequently temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, politicians in the city are not innocent that this should be the case because they have contributed to the massive increase in automobile traffic and thus, according to the VCD, by neglecting line bus transport with diluted tactics and by a little commitment to cycling.
The municipality also agrees on the participation of the city of the Pforzheim/Enzkreis energy and climate protection agency.
In addition, the agenda stands on the accession to the Climate Change Pact of the Land Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the city's children's day facilities and the request for entry into the Smart City Promotion of the Bundes.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to follow Corona protection measures.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost a half year delay Tim Zimmermann starts in his premiere season in ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the League of Supersportwagens can take up the regular operation, the first tests took place.
For Zimmermann, it was especially about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenagener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are some things that are different from the porch from the front season," says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS, you have to go differently into the curves.
But it really has been a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports cars in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience in the GT sport, the Dutch has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand brightly and we have made enormous progress on the Lausting Ring from session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supersport cars will be racing through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newers, knows the route.
He was the last guest in the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked fast and I had to get a little used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausets ring has many quick passages that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast the roomman is then really, this will come out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams poker a little at the tests," he says.
"In the end, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
Current status is that no spectator will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the middle of August at Nürburgring, the Ex-Formel-1 Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantine Decision Cold
The decision of the British Government to place Spanish holidays under quarantine for two weeks after their return, according to press reports, took the transport minister of the country cold.
Thus Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues decided the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet struck the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so that shapps will also have to return to quarantines after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
However, the scheme applies to those who are only on the day of vacation, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered to be one of the "safe countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Talous ministers probably knew in advance that there is the possibility of a quarantine to be imposed for holidays in Spain," commented the Labour Delegated Diane Abbot.
"But obviously no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps."
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona disaster in Spain and the expiry of the strict exit blocks, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists are particularly responsible for the new spread of nightlife.
Spain is one of the most popular vacation countries of the British.
From unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the British Government is currently advising, the most popular Canary Islands and Balearians are excluded from that.
To date, more than 272.000 infections with the new corona virus and more than 28.000 deaths have been registered in Spain.

Life threatening floods, strong winds and heavily rainfall were now threatened by parts of the U.S. State, the National Hurrikan Centre of the US Climate Authority NOAA informed in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out the distress for many districts.
The corona pandemic in Texas difficulties the work of the helpers, said Abbott, according to the US media.
Evacuated for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle".
In view of the spinal storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is still worsened if one considers that it is fading through a region that is the most affected by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona Pandemic.
Abbott called people who had to leave their homes for caution.
You should not disregard practices, "who we used to", such as the wearing of masks, said the governor according to the transmitter CBS.
It's important that everyone kept distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, Corona was to be tested in emergency accommodations.
In the first place, damage had only been reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning revoked
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" according to the authorities had been hit on the island of Padre Island directly in front of the Texas coast on land.
The tropical storm had previously been graduated to the lowest level.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a warning had first been issued and was later withdrawn.
The authorities expected a decline, while "Hanna" continues to move into the inner country and to move to the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, the Hurricane "Douglas" was on the night on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour in the direction of Hawaii.
However, the hurricane center expected that he would continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, he is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm almost below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an excessively active orchid season this year after a prediction of May.
From June to late November, up to ten Hurricanes are expected, of which up to six might become very strong spinal storms, the Authority had explained.
On average, over the Atlantic, there are six hurricanes per year, three of them grow into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, which a lower average even only at 10 percent, was then called.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote by Twitter that his government was carefully observing the storms and in contact with the affected states.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard hurt
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a relapse for double winner FC Bayern.

Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to grant the WM titles.
All America races were cancelled, however.
Running calendar becomes more and more concrete
The Renn Calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take form.
The Grand Prix, which has been confirmed so far, has been added to three more race routes during the week.

Thus, the numbers of infections in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams, not wanting to drive in Brazil, would also not justify dismissal.
You are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke of her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's famous lateight show by video switch and told her what she had in her head at her meeting with Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was visited by video switch in a popular US Latenight show.
Among other things, she told about her fight against the mighty ones of the world.
The teenager spoke also about her famous "evil view" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg made notice with her immovable efforts for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known lateight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climb Summit last year.
Latight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday at your mission and led a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the powerfuls of the world.
"There are some things that have surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to lead the focus away from the climate crisis," they shocked.
"All from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children go on the street" she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who are ridiculing against them in social media or even trying to silence them, they find "cool" because they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look after the US president Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the actistin sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has been seen by countless people on the Internet since then.
From the short clip a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which was finally one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. presidents at this moment?
On Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly dryly: "To be honest, I think that doesn't require any further explanation."
With the sound reply, the experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect it and soon disappeared laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" talk about the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a railway trip: After a fast rise with Fleetwood Mac it went steep down and then slowly back up.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult trailer: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at 73 years of age, family members informed on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton honoured Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and present members of the Band Fleetwood Mac.
The Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-term legendary band in London in 1967 until today its dreamed instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a backway trip.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a fast rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes without him.
It must have been a struggle, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for well-acting purposes.
He began to appear in wide garments and with great cruzifix.
Also psychic problems are supposed to have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in the psychiatrie.
Over a large part of the 1970s, musicians disappeared from the image surface.
He was supposed to have lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in a Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish worker family in the London District of Bethnal Green.
He was enthusiastic for American blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was 11 years old, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was engaged in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues tree, Green founded in the summer of 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers collar Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The group composed by Green "Albatross" in the winter of 1968/69 declared the first number 1 hit and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
However, the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not rape the media wreck, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
The life between music and abuse he commented later in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best was to land a number 1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 was surprisingly successful with a album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims without him in new formation on a success wave.
Her album "Rumours" appeared in 1977, sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not achieve any bigger comeback until he started in 1996 with a group of friends of musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Free of drugs, Green published some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues-league at life - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in recent decades.
