Did I say too much?
May I ask who?
Was anyone hurt?

It's nice to dance.
Maybe I'm not returning.

Have you talked to someone about these things?
Don't worry!
I like your scarf.
What is she talking about?
She should've already done it.
Tell me what to think.

It's blowing today.
Tom and I were both happy.
I washed while the infant slept.
Can you speak these words?
I'll pick Tom up.
There lived a wild tribe there at that time.
You gotta go now.
I can do it too.

Hey, where are we?
I think we should go.
Sit down, Tom.
I don't like watching TV.
I'll leave it to you.
What do we have here?
How can I stop Tom?
Is there anybody there?
It wouldn't matter anyway.
I don't know if he's a doctor.
He went into the bank dressed as a guard.
I can't do it now.
One day you'll forget about me.
We've seen what Tom can do.

Be loved!
That could be fun.
Believe what you want.
We have to work now.
How can we serve?
Don't disclose it.
Don't blame me, I don't have anything to do with that video.

We love you so much.
It happens automatically.
Tom has asked me to marry him.
The Dutch are closely related to German.
And why not?

This egg is fresh.
I knocked Emily.
How bad was that?
Parents love their children.

Who are all these people?
I didn't ask any questions.
It's empty.
Tom was looking at Mary.
The bird is in heaven.
Can you believe this actually happens?

I'm the law.
That wasn't the plan.
Please come with us.
Can you watch the kids?
I think Tom didn't understand the joke.
When I found the room, it was empty.

It's pretty cold.
Nobody cares what you think.
They were cracking.
Shouldn't you use gloves?
It's a gift.
I could never keep a secret.
Tom could be a cop.
I can't eat.

Have you forgotten?
Did you have fun at the tour?
Tom and Mary are mostly married.
Did you sed this by hand?
It's right for him.
Tom got bleached.

She's taken too much work on herself.
She's stubborn.
Give Tom a grip.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter ever came out or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're going to be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under tag wire.

Steady Tom?
I'm going like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
We're friends, aren't we?
Her speech trampled me out.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Tom suggests, unless anyone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak to myself.
Tell me what the problem is.

You should have liked it.
I got some more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate is cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There is no doubt who is chosen.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep myself motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about the ring trilogin?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not a easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?

You weren't here then.
Here's Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.

I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the curve.
I hope you'll find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Come back into the truck.
She helped the old man over the way.
No one's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with dirty masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
Nothing of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom tricked me.
Tom helps.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
It's time.
My father is healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a few gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've already done it.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy grabbed the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mosquitoes.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk a hit with Tom between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She acts like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train quickly accelerated.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but you can at least accept that there are people who have other opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet dependency.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom was blinking with the shining light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like to come here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
There's no one here who's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men were smiling.
Come sit down.
That must be enough.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motor sauce is broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This will take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
One ink fish has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
That was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful view.
Tom's fast.
Of the Finns, about 4.9 per cent are Finnish Swiss, that is, people with Swedish languages.
Unfortunately, Tom left.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I made the wedding tower.
Use a scalpel, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attended a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like that?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver wrestled the wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.
Tom said he didn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everyone dreams.
Miles are made on wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you were going to feel it.
At home, I discovered the invasion.
The cat has two ears.
Actually not.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes to sing.

I don't see anybody.
The more you get to know her, the more you will like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
Which is your favorite fast food restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We have to find it.
What's missing?
I can do it myself!
Don't worry.
She paid seven percent interest on the loan.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kick you.
