Food debt to European Inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the depreciation was higher than expected in November – after 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian Notenbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the headline. The reduction in interest rates would favour the rising raw material prices and the slightly decrease in unemployment in the form of inflation spirals.
The ECB is trying to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least hardly sticking to the two-percent mark.
According to an analytist, the ECB is in the twice mill: in order to exclude subsequent action needs, inflation needs to be "conformed".
In November the inflation rate reached a 12-year record height with 3.3 per cent in Germany; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The rise in food and energy prices are responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat notations increased by 88 per cent, and the course for soybeans has also reached a record height since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products were also significantly degraded in 2007.
The world market price for raw oil increased this year by 52 per cent - last month, the price per faece of the black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it is expected to decrease to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analyticals estimate a 3% inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest twice.
Gallup Site of Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathisants has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the consent for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached a depth of 13 per cent which has never existed.
The difference is clearly evident in the participating voters, thanks to the high determination of opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) are faced with a fifth (20 percent) consent for MSZP.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary enthusiasm: they are two percent in the total population.
The number of party choosers has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic atmosphere has further deteriorated - never before, the proportion of those who consider the economic situation of the country as "extremely bad" has been so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent consider it "reasonably bad".
After hopefuler prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation, but only one tenth is an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - judged the work of the Prime Minister as "more bad than right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the advocates for Viktor Orbán represents 38 percent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the Head of Government at all, compared to 27% distrust against the Head of Parties of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think that they could manage the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister without any change of government.
After the disturbances last October, 35% had been expressed for the remaining of the government and the Head of Government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asking for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent answered that they would participate "with certainty" and another 20% would vote "probably".
In comparison, Parliament's elections would take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the Urns, another 15% believe their participation as "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be evident.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% would vote against the hospital day fees.
The shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84 or 89 per cent.
Alsoan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained the average price increase of 16% of the last year this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas Corps of Napi has also increased by 16 per cent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases were recorded from over 1,000 HUF.
After the prices in the food markets have been "drawn from this" last December, the rate of explosion has not been drastically reduced, compared to the high, earlier baseline level.
However, it certainly disturbs consumers that what they had paid far below 9,000 HUF last year is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the Napi cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained nearly at the previous level, and the prices for putenbrust filets, nuts and moons are strongly increased.
Prices for flour and bread were similar to data from the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but there were 1kg bread wakes for 139 Forint in Auchan.
There was no competitive price crash on the product under 200 Forint.
Similarly, the price of a two litres of Coca-Cola pfand bottle under 200 Forint was surprising, so the drink including Pfand only cost 257 HUF.
Yet this year, the Napi cart compare alsoan the most expensive, and the Cora most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in "Napi" cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart in the last year and the expense of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the increase in VAT in prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
This exact procedure has taken the trade: it seems that the houses of goods could not properly decide what price margins they were supposed to apply to each article, since the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were indefinite.
(If the dealer plans the circulation rate of a product poorly, he may fall to significant profits in the price range that is based on the transport intensity.)
Measure tax-related expenses of the Napi cart last year were so radical that the expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 forint, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, since the most expensive basket cost by 1,630.00 Forint more than in the previous year, and even the cheapest price increase was 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a disastrous rise in prices was shown, the price of daily consumption products in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foods, the Statistical Office found a more than 30% depreciation in the 12 months period.
As in approximately flour, even in eggs.)
However, if one looks into the Napi cart, this seems almost impossible in the last one, since the price level of the expensive product even in the worst case has increased by less than 10 percent.
Apparently, dairy suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - in any case they could devour the drastic rise in prices to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets are not complaining; it is reported on good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores no longer looks at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, sustainable foods go over the shop tables in palettes.
Wednesday morning morning, there were endless snakes in all three stores at the cash when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so that many multis complain to the opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only in food but also in sustainable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved
Heuer has been registered in hospitals more than a thousand infections resulting from inadequate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions in hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not exactly comparable to the impression of infections, says the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the Janos Hospital's Traumatology Department, a MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was transmitted to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a severe auto accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important surgery has not been performed since then because of the bacterium that is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December of this year, the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System reported infections caused by multiresistant agents from hospitals, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So so many infections caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers should be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium is carrying about one third of the people in their nose without causeing a disease.
SA-related infections (such as neck inflammation, male inflammation, skin inflammation or wound) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the funds are taken too high or are not used properly, the bacteria responding to antibiotics resistant, which are rapidly spreading in hospitals under the corresponding conditions.
In particular, these bacteria may cause severe infections, such as infected wounds or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis, in patients with weak or permanently poor immune system, but also in elderly patients with low body weight.
According to the doctor head of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events are part of the everyday hospital.
You may not confuse the infection with the epidemic, admonished Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only nowhere it is not searched.
Resistance to antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the nursing personnel carry rubber gloves and masks in supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients are examined for MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided when they are transmitted to the hospital.
Sample withdrawals too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current conditions and circumstances would be unfavourable to prevent the development or spread of the multi-resistant organism, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and age homes, the spirals should examine the patients submitted and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
In Hungary hospitals, however, microbiological sampling is not practiced so often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the side of the public healthcare facility.
Therefore, most cases would not be evident until the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the doctor's head of the Epidemiology Center.
On the side of the European Union there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives for the treatment of certain infections and pictures of disease in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapy is supposed to be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary to avoid resistance to the medicine, but these directives are not always complied with by hospitals.
Ambulants, or patients in basic supply, are even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz, microbiological samples.
Saved for disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to another most frequently by nursing staff.
That is precisely why the washing of hands, or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drop-infection or contact, but in local hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are even often overfilled, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz continues, it is unfortunately occurs in the less financially well-established hospitals even that there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that are directly favouring the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or the further spread of the ingredient, where these protective measures are respected, Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Taking over MRSA infections causes the health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its impression in the government programme, was held.
Following the first signs, the program is successful - as published data proves, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decline.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of multi-resistant diseases (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to be one of its priorities.
Death lower politics were not drunk
The official opinion is now available in the case of a car accident with fatal outcome caused by the Chief of the XXII district.
The now retired police head of the XXII district, who killed a footgänger in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor drug influenced, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme State Prosecutor on Friday after the official opinion was submitted on the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police officer had not used alcohol before he set himself on the tax.
The former police officer booked with his own truck in the XXII. district into Kossuth Lajo's street and traveled over a 55-year-old man who crossed the street at a unsigned place.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milder condition - the steering driver has, even if footgängers do not cross the road at the Zebra strip, afterrange.)
The pedestrian will be injured after his delivery to the hospital.
According to police reports, the steward suffered a shock, then left his functions and asked for retirement.
The Budapest State Prosecutor has initiated its investigations for the event.
In addition, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police officer had cooperated with the detectives from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest at a total value of EUR 400 million on Friday.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) has approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by the Cohesion Fund in 2006.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to be used on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will mainly flow into research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
The metro line 4 was also spoken at the meeting.
It was agreed that once Hungary has disclosed the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects at a total of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is made available by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, without provision.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradises of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is awesome - the whole of Europe is looking out for the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who is still buying the cheapest market in the EU, which becomes fastly expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most desired real estate purchasing plant in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, Albena, the Golden Coast, the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar, but property around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly demanded.
According to the assessments of Re/Max Analytists in Bulgaria, the national interior also attended earlier or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the excellently favourable area of Russia records more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers attracting offers - trade and office areas offer the highest yield.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists alongside the summer and winter season during the two other seasons of the year.
Forecast investors, therefore, already buy in large style, for example around Bansko.
Analyticals say that people who acquire property in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy re-vitalised real estate by EUR 50-10,000, or downcoming houses by EUR 5-15,000, which they are renovating themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are greatly written, but also the proximity to a large city, businesses and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group forms businessmen who invest in a medium- to long-term increase in value.
Real estate in the capital, however, becomes more expensive, due to the constantly growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been an annual price increase of 21 per cent.
The expenses at the real estate prices are far beyond the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting the Bali Roadmap, where emission reduction measures are defined for the time after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
There is currently a violent debate between industrial and development countries.
The United States has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support the developing countries both financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
A agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The Adjustment Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-headed Council, foreseen in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary’s six percent
Mr Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its prerequisite role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), whether or not the "accession agreement after 2012" is successful or not.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already undertaken 8 per cent with its 15 Member States at that time.
The standard for Hungary is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will be fully fulfilled, as is recorded in the Environmental Ministry's Press Release.
The effort is high on Bali - nevertheless, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would take effect only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new international emission reduction system, whose importance also has been highlighted by the IPCC, the internationally excellent UN UN Climate Change Committee, in its recent report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, according to scientists, which would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British army is wearing on YouTube
United Kingdom Army units have published recordings on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for popularity increases on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for himself: Loading videos on operations conducted against the Taliban since March 2006 in Afghanistan, reports the BBC.
Miniatur cameras rotated on helmets are controlled at the air weapons base in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Air Force soldiers have already accompanied 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Defence Ministry was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have its own YouTube channels.
Investment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has the videos to be published in order to recruit soldiers, and as the Defence Ministry says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the people about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such a kind of propaganda is almost free compared to conventional television advertising, says defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence of the military actions adopted by the government in their own way.
American advertising with game
However, the army must also fight against amateur recordings that create it, in addition to the carefully processed, censured recordings, also in the network - such as those showing the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken mostly, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos turned in use have been loaded to the platform, but this "gattation" has only recently discovered the British for themselves.
Yet, the Americans are advertising in the somewhat different way, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the players can run into the soldier's skin in the context of a more or less lively simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Working Minister Mónika Lamperth is in no way ambiguous: instead of having a Christmas celebration, she organises a working conference where her employees can get out of the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magic Christmas atmosphere with Tombola, or stumble into official hearts.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held in the defence resort, but the ministerial staff are not expected to do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the Orchestra" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission Festival" family members of currently posted soldiers abroad, but there is also a receipt for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport strikes.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, some 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebration is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola loss.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a festival.
The hall rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a NFU department is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU money.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspiel Theater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of the rooms.
Some 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a talk from the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
On request of [origo], it was informed: there was no ball dress or suit obligation at the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Work, and Self-Management prepare each for puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister Mónika Lamperth officially invites her employees to a Christmas celebration, not at all, but at the Annual Assembly Conference.
It is expected that about 180 guests, which - so the press department - are only hosted with coffee and pogatsche, will end with 350,000 forint.
Mr Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Self-Management, will just hit his colleagues in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas celebration at its own festival hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 Forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent attacks.
Since the beginning of János Veres' office, PM employees celebrate each year in this way.
However, there will be no proper party stumulation - not only because of the minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was set up for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year Receipt on 20th, the Christmas celebration of the Ministry this time.
Invite the one hundred guests to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városligat"); according to the information of the resort, the expenditure are measured by 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomates only accredited in Hungary are loaded.
The receptions organised each year are traditionally starting with a short talk from the minister and sounds with restraints.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asking for the costs of Christmas celebration, no information could be given at the Environmental Ministry's Press Department.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded to celebrate, which is organised in the art industry museum.
More and more forces mobilised for giant stripes
On Friday, the Liga trade unions and the Hungarian trade unions form their coordination committee for the unlimited duration of the strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday a major protest assembly will be held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the health insurance law - the work detention will begin.
It is expected to have strike-related, significant traffic disabilities, as railway transport is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) also reach up to 13 o'clock.
Details about the strike on Monday will be communicated on Friday afternoon by the Liga trade unions and the trade unions federation.
There is also a LIGA - MOSZ Strike Committee, responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a major protest assembly will be held, and from Monday on, all organisations connected to the strike will lay down the work for an indefinite time, provided that no agreement with the government is reached.
In other words, the end of the strike starting on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the strike committees shall meet to consult on the further approach.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will only come to vote on the health insurance law in the afternoon hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to expect considerable traffic disabilities: the railways lay down their work for an indefinite time, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies are still in the morning.
At the same time, there will be in many places motorway blocks in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is kept up to date on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others plan a temporary work delay.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the free trade unions of the Railways VDSZSZ on sufficient services, although about Christmas holidays more and more people are on the train.
According to previous reports, LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy are laying down work for four hours, and the teachers' trade unions have called on the democratic teachers' trade unions to two or two-hour strikes.
The Hungarian physician association strikes country-wide alternating at various times, the EDDSZ, the democratic union of health and social workers, a suborganisation of the SZEF, the forum for trade cooperation of trade unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the Liga is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for social discurses.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will expire from the next year.
Requirement No 3 is that access to the early retirement system will be allowed to the claimable professional groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that the PDSZZ members of the Liga trade unions did not accept the offer that was submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now demands a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garden increases State risk
According to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Garden, which was founded in August with the support of the "Move for a Better Hungary", increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several ways.
The "Risk Warning Report" of the Institute includes: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Garden, the highest political risk represents the "sharpment of existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeunes and the non-cignan population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the Hungarian Garden Strategy, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, says the research institute.
According to the report, this is considered to be neglected by political officers: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of Roma's questions to representatives of radical political groups, which have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Ungarn contrary."
It is suspected that this would intensify the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favour extremities, and increase the probability of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Garden, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "have seriously damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity."
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has continued to rise, so since summer 2007 several “national self-defense association” organisations have been founded.
"These groups are common to define themselves as civil organisations each while they are openly praising to prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defence tasks (catatrofene protection, national defence, order protection), under appeal to the inappropriateness of the police, the army, or the state itself," said it.
And further, all of this happens in accordance with the method of attempting to denote different political and party-based political efforts as a citizen initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of association does not therefore just serve the circumvention of legal obstacles that could appear in the course of the registration of courts - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Garden also represent a risk-sensitive factor in relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In the last few months, the Hungarian Garden has been quoted in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, as some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Ungarn policy in the formation of the Hungarian Garden.
All of this has an impact on the region's political stability', said it.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Garden is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garden are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Garden, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the Right Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Based on the development of the Bulgarian Garden, the Roma mass excretions took place in a city district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The GNU has taken the events to the start of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organisation of "national protection" is.
In their view, in the past 17 years, a fairly "ciguent terror" has been noticeable in Bulgaria, but the state has remained untapped and disadvantaged - so political capital.
In addition, the initiative would have started a violent debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk for ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own garden for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Garden so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Garden, it is not excluding that the Hungarian Roma, with the organisation of their own protection, react to the threats, says the political capital risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said on request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changed trends should be detectable, the public opinion is informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not everywhere
In Hungary holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of redisposing the working days has been established around the holidays now, but the next year is less such days.
Even in the EU and in America, something else is understood as "first day".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and unemployed days.
Unemployed days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are unemployed days - the last one is already able to rest with the Silvester celebrations.
We have a total of fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The public celebrations are March 15, which reminds us of the revolution of 1848, and October 23, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the foundation of the state, the work celebrated on May 1st, on November 1 and 2 we remember our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecosts, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved to be valid in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the prolonged weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before it, or we have to go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Ministry of Labour has for many years set out in its own regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employers, to public servants and officials of the public service.
Except only companies and facilities where the operation is continuing without interruption, i.e. on holidays.
Heuer's working order will only be brought together by the holidays at the end of the year. From 24 December, life in this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Silver Time Balances, or the holidays that have been awarded for it.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so there will be less disposal in the working days than this year.
The calendar will first be placed around the day of work "on the head" so that people can stay at home at the same time four days at the piece.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 will be a rest day.
The second redisposition is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, the Friday, 24 October, will have to be finished.
The end of the year, however, will be restless in the sign of the holidays after everything is lying and still standing from 24 December, even if Saturdays fall on one Wednesday.
Six disturbing little things to annoy working colleagues
E-mails that we forgot to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" to the everyday workplace.
The question is simply whether you get used to these small discomforts, or if you look better to the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstanding situations consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," said a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret it and try to recover it by calling at the marketing department and repentantly confessing that you would have forgotten to deliver the message (this is the less common method).
Mostly, the matter has gone away with an apology.
Before you get into embarrassed excuses, you should consider what you can really prepare for your colleagues unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Have you borrowed something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly something more nervous than when you grab a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the pencil was still on the desk - is it gone today?
Or is the lost believed bullet writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, nothing should be borrowed from the colleagues, because they are rightly angry if they find that something has come away.
So, no envelopes or post-it from the office put in your pocket, because it could meet you yourself: nothing more if you really need it.
Talk about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trick that has already been put into the world.
Who did with who?
Where and why?
It is possible not to bind the information (or suspects) about the private life of the colleagues to everyone!
And if someone opens himself and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent as a grave instead of orienting those who are not present, even if others also know about the problems of the colleague.
Without reason ill reported?
If you call at the office to report yourself sick on annoying headaches, because you feel unwell or just want to rest, you should be over one in clearness: your own work, indispensable work, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues instead of yourself.
So don't play badly to the colleagues!
If you know that the next day you won't get to the office, or that something could come in between, why you need to stay home, you should notify it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly faced with the absence.
Total, checks, telephones
You have just been deepened in your work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the sound of the colleagues?
Unfortunately a telephone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not have the colleagues with sums, singing, loud talks (which are leading over their heads), trampling, constant squeezing or nerves.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deeply involved in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not finished in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, do not seek the fault of your forgetfulness to others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one admits his mistakes and apologizes if others were affected!
The question of how to recover the mistake, or how to recover the failure, is all too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training bouquets and sleeves: Comfortable for home, but nothing has lost in the office!
Not even then you should wear such a bad dress if the workplace would actually allow it!
Just don't get too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so far that you dress in the office - if you wish, also beautiful and elegant!
It wants to make it right for everyone - or how do you become uninteressant for others?
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning stop.
From the radio a strange melody emerges: the sound of a goat, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds the bass comes, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which climbs on Mr2.
The home music scene has for a long time not just confused us with qualitative electropop.
But now you even see the stuff different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garage rock with its guitar gequitche is again "in", the local electropop proves: there are new things under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, even musiced in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a host house does not stand two peppers - began to walk his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of Jazz, Electronic, and pop swallowed, but he only succeeded when he was asked to compose the soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezone" by Ferenc Törok.
The formation that occurred at the beginning in smaller clubs was only known to the broader audience when the magazine "wan2" ripped its first album from 2002 under the top 50 local albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, to nearly the only, even in the western marketable tendency.
No doubt Zagar and his band "trendy" were, however, nobody was interested in whether they liked to wear this brand.
The band has responded how it should: with a new, even better album.
The now published new album entitled "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the titles already express the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term comes from the time that Baláz's Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would also be okay, but next to the etheric character of music, the - the time spirit and trends - purer guitar, the influence of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the sanger György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio slager - the most newly sent from early to late pop music, Mr2 Petñofi, has put the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded under the participation of six home singers ("Underground Divas"), successive the ear worm.
So everything is okay (?).
The Hvg.hu asked at Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "stage music" doesn't mean much to me.
I believe there are two boxes in pop music, not the mainstream and the underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be seen and nonsense, but they can also be produced only for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener's reception will also work independently according to this principle, languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience of your music?
B.Z.: In abroad, especially western, pop music has a bigger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twenties on concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them much more carefully because they also think they are part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important to who, where, how many hear your music?
B.Z.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more comes to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is mostly evident in the concerts where there is already a mutual interaction, but it is only in the immaterable changes of the moment.
Yet, one thing has been noticed to me: If you want to make it right for everyone, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the west.
B.Z.: We do not really go his way, even if you try to interpret this again and again in our music.
We see ourselves rather than team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
At first, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were inevitable, since several of us came out of his band and took a different way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of Mr2 Petñofi, "Wings of Love" is the first place.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style towards a broader audience deliberately?
E.g.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the soundorgia and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just her, what was the lead principle?
B.Z.: The basic thought was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to compile the choir from talented soloists of the domestic music scene.
Thus the six-headed choir - so Sena, Edina Cutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik州 Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we baptized after "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like the song, or did the girls make it?
B.Z.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number still needed something.
The accord order formally demanded a vocal vote.
I sent the melody in the same night, and later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on top and terrifyingly spontaneously.
I remember that I was rather electriced at the time, but it needed the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert, however, they had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, singing perfectly together and are not harder than the music, so their song is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood behind on the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Z.: The fact that they were behind was so because of pure technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want them to have solo rolls.
The number is also about forgetting his ego a little, forgetting who's coming from where and where we're going, we simply allow these specific wings to raise the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric condition that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most important song?
E.g.: In the musical creation work, there has been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove wouldn't work anymore, but gradually everything has merged, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number from the new album?
E.g. Zs: This changes on the concerts and also now that I have the album "losaising".
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceivers risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Groundless fraud
This is the name of his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société Genérale, owner of the comerční banka.
It came about five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it the same to his colleagues, and was certainly not incapable of it.
In contrast to all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the American mortgage market in time.
"He's more psychically weak," was to hear from the mouth of his managers who showed him at the police.
But as the statements of Kerviel, published by the French media, for example the Le Monde newspaper, show, he was a man who had gained €1.6 billion with his businesses at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claimed in his statement.
In summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just at the U.S. crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as those of poor customers or those who had previous disbursement problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not be influenced on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe this and maintained justice.
At the end of the year, he had gained up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I deserved the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain this," Ker much admits and continues saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he has forged documents so that they can't get to him.
He even managed to lead his boss behind the light, even if the Eurex stock exchanges were gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Did he fear flying up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work up his position gradually.
He joined the Société Genérale in 2000, immediately after graduating at Lyon University.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a maker and in 2005 he became an independent maker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"But at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the Alliance's shares, he earned a lot by putting a half billion euros on the price losses of this title at the London bomb attacks.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you
"This is like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the chiefs said they knew about everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I earned money, your eyes were closed."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great battle came.
On one day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer employer of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him?
He made himself suspicious by a vacation.
"I only took four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look in his cards," said Ker lots of terminating.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, which will allow the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) in the next few years.
This is about half of the sum which the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007-2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into the development of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 per cent of the resources available to Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies gain funds for innovative businesses.
This will help companies to gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
So far, the money acquisition from EU funds includes Czech Republic among the new accession countries, among the least successful so far.
Nicaraguan Court confirms twenty-year penalty for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year penalty for the former President Arnold Alemán, which he had been sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (at least $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest at his Hazienda at the Nicaragua Metropole.
Whether the former Head of State (1997-2002) will come back to this Middle American State, according to the news agency AP, is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials, whether to let Alemán sit his punishment at home or if he has to go to prison.
A court pointed out four years ago that Alemán had regularly shifted the government's money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is
Yeah, it's done.
The government budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted without the support of the opposition by the majority of coalitions.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) was still approved for the current year because Minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could therefore not allow to reject it.
Unlike a vivid debate before the vote on the question of distrust against the government, there was nothing dramatic this time.
The House of Members approved this traditionally low-reached, yet very important law in all tranquillity.
That's paradox.
All governments start and end with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered by the government's power struggle and opposition.
This is a more appreciable subject for the media, so they give him more attention.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than faster numbers.
The government budgets were under three weak points in the past social democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot remove at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, not only pensions, but also social expenditure, which has decided the "suspending" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficient budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of the communities.
However, the largest risk is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors used to provide additional sources of investment except taxes, levies and bank loans, often unconsidered debts that incurred their council houses in excess.
In recent years, they have succeeded in paying these debts through massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks which they had received in the train of privatisation by the State.
Now this source is already decorated.
As far as we keep on official and verifyable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years, such as the rest of the world, whose ČSSD is familiar with it.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments to settle public finances.
Instead, these governments debted the State even more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame that is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are one of the countries that are at least threatened by poverty, seen in the global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been excessively exhausted in the last few years.
Even though it has been successful to strike some of the insane populistic expenditure adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no shift in the age of retirement and a pension reform in the next time, practically every policy in this country will end, and, no matter who is in power, he will remain as a pure administrator.
It is only easy to exaggerate when it is said that there will then be officials from dominant politicians who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
This is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only prevent the suppression of normal expenditure through duty expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns planned for 2008 would certainly be excessive if former governments had not spent over the past ten years, which only went on.
If we do not want it really to be made of dominant politicians to become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the State can only spend as much as it can take on taxes and fees in a position to want rest when preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow progressive implementation of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on financial markets.
Thus, more than $100 billion will be available to monetary markets by means of auctions.
On these auctions the banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other money.
For example, the American Fed sends 40 billion dollars to auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, following the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to defence or degradation of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to remove the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can grant," wrote a report to his customers Bernard Baumöhl from the Economic Outlook Group advisory company.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added Baumahl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion for unemployed loans, especially in the United States.
Analytists are expecting further billions of losses.
"The central banks must really have been afraid of what can be done when they decided to do this," said the manager of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and reduce the American economy into a recession, perhaps with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in the loan between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid of borrowing each other money, although the US, Canada and UK central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks contributes to the heating of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologist debates are incredible
Global climate change is claimed to be the most damage to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the problem of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the final international conference of the UN on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, not a green planet", he concluded that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and such of non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a replacement for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President underlined in his book that its topic is very important for him and that he is so engaged in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet with caricatures of my views."
So now stakeholders could read his attitude straight away.
Klaus reminded me that he was not a climate toologist, but he believes he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is eventually academic, capable of understanding and assessing technical treatments, has experience in statistics and is also a national economyer.
As the main statement of the book, he declared these that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too serious and therefore are not threatening, and that efforts to influence climate development are excessive, effective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it to be a person who has experience in totalitarian systems that is unacceptable to force other unprofessed views, which he considers as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant ecoactivists, who do not take into account the relationship between effort and profit."
Klaus had spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people failed to exchange their driving licence
600000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity lasts at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the new year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the streets without valid driving permission.
According to the authorities, mostly those who do not want to drive have failed to exchange their driving licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of driving licences, the offices of the capital are surrendered with applications, and the interest in exchange increased this week.
The city administration finishes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not changed their licence.
The exhibition of a new driving licence takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a short term of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and run without a valid driving licence threaten a penalty from January.
The wrongdoer pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
But the police can also be able to use it with an admonition when it comes to infringement.
In case of infringement, the punishment may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the municipality can also impose a penalty that is not driving at all.
He could threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the agencies to give mildness and put up a punishment of 1,000 crowns.
According to the speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand crown punishment.
The license is a document where everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a personnel card that everyone, a valid one, has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give off their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality or to send him there by registration.
At the end of the year, driver licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, the drivers must gradually also exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years of time for exchange.
The validity of driver licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other driving licences.
The court reduces penalties for detectives who were connected with Berdych
The former police officers Joseph Opava and Petr KoÃařík, who are accused of jointly doing with the bands of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided in a legal judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally the detectives of the "Agent for the fight against organised crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Contrary to today's judgment, there is no appeal, only revision is possible at the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is also accused of in this case, but first of all, he is in charge of the first sentence.
However, in other processes, he had already received a total of 16 years of punishment.
He can't be convicted to more.
In January, a district court blamed 19 people mainly for participation in robberies, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most defendants argued from the beginning to the accusation with the reason, it is a constructed case.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, members of the police in agreement, including Berdych criminals, gave information from police sources, covered various robberies, and helped members of the bands to withdraw from criminal prosecution.
The bands left Opava and Koşařík 30 percent of the prey.
The accusation concerns crimes of the bands between 1999 and 2001.
Especially for robberies whose victims often suffered severe injuries, but also for official and unauthorized arms possession.
The police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser target pipe and a machine gun.
According to the accusation, the band has enriched by many millions of crowns by their robberies.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this proceedings, Berdych courts and a number of others recognized legally as guilty for further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's circuit must be responsible in another process, further cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiation is to date Tomáš Pěta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery for criminal persecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million crowns from the Třebíč Hospital for the exchange of children in a discharge hospital to require compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The lawyer of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees entirely with Velebas' proposal.
"We reject such a proposal that it is too much high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"In order to give us an opinion on this counter proposal, however, we need the opinion that the opposite had to draw up.
We'll find out if it's worth explanation at all.
However, we believe that this should be for all in the hundreds of thousands," stressed Dostál.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jabloñov family wanted a million crowns for each month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, a opinion for which the University Hospital in Prague Motol had prepared for him served as the basis for compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of children suffered mental damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men wore the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
Again, the women are dealing with the consequences of the experienced trauma more badly, as well as with what is now going on, Veleba collected the content.
On 9 December last year, Veronika and Nikola exchanged the nurses of the disposal hospital in Třebíč.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloşov.
At the end of October, the district head of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Märische Höhe) delivered 100,000 crowns to each family as a substitute for expenditure resulting from the error of the hospital in Třebíč under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are liable for law.
In case of doubt, they must take a reserve fund, and only exceptionally they can apply for assistance to the institution.
To date, the courts have addressed relatively low amounts of damage, the amounts were determined by tables and have moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came around his Kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the struggle about the brand "Kingdom Walachei".
According to the judge at the Ostrava District Court, he first used the name "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in long-term work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not finished and his client will probably make a call.
"The struggle is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitary," said after polívkas lawyer.
Everyone introduced themselves to the words "Walachic Kingdom" just this actor and comic.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money creation and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a struggle for money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasitely at our work," he continued.
Random business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Whale King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actress Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But it was not the intention of justifying a fictional Kingdom at that time.
Some years later, Harabiš thought to spend walachic passports.
From an initially funny action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystalized out, where Harabiš then joined the establishment of the company "Walachisches Königreich".
In 1997 Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered its owners reductions when visiting his farm and his theatre ideas.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka published in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurship intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has safely helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of the controversial parties today took place until 2000, when Harabiš organised the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš, the disputes embraced in the release of "King Boleslavs I. elected to the day of Sankt Nimmerleins".
The role of the leadership was then invoked by Harabiš's Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka delivered the complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearness in the fight could bring the race prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
It would be a new king.
Details and an appointment he did not want to betray yet.
"We don't want to hurry.
It should be like the royal circuit in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also log in quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Further disappear
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much worth, the quality of the circuit switching, the control and also the processing could be described as rather under-average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combi with the name SW is another piece further, and I just stay to review my opinion.
For example, when I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, I had to complain about the low freedom of head on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the combi's core series is designed so that not even two meters of men will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I'm just going through the interior equipment in a short time to not repeat too much.
It is a rather successful design where I have objections only because of the careful central tunnel.
There I would welcome some more designing design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over where we may complain about to short seats or head supports.
The side content has also improved considerably compared to the 206.
As regards the space offer, you can also feel the increased dimensions of the carrosserie.
In the combi, the lack of freedom of head already mentioned is also removed.
Bag in the suitcase
But the main thing about this car is the cargo room.
I have to refer to it (also due to the foldable back window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The hole rooms are equipped with belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, can be separated and hold more difficult items.
But let's talk about the load volume.
It is, according to the table in the basic equipment, 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sales vehicle of this class in Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains about 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign holiday or when inviting a children's cart.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after the rear seat is wrapped, or the very low loading edge.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzine engine with a hubra of 1.6 litres and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this is what a 1600-cubic motor should look like that, that's a family-hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and he's moving well away.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems to be blocked with a laptop, then I can only be enthusiastic by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly national.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inner and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at a height of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite much.
The premium of the test truck will be taken with 80000 crowns in addition to booking.
However, we had headairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic discwasher release, electric windows behind and and...
Thus the car costs totally simple 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains what brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from countries of Eastern Europe is increasing, which causes local fears about the further development of local schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has hit a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are increasing in violence.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Disputes, chikanes and robberies among students have been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has already developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The defendant defended himself by the boy who offended her with racist disgraces.
The police also had to intervene after a attack of two minor girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls claimed to have made racist comments to the man and cast him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bushouse and spooked at us.
When I told him to stop, he sold us with apples and pears and then blown his seat," a mother of Slovak students of The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the inhabitants even referred to the struggle with the immigrants from Eastern Europe as survival.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between local and immigrants at British schools becomes increasingly tense.
In Great Britain, 70,000 Slovakians were reported to come here on job search.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students then visit British schools.
Cuba - most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really a island of freedom.
Whatever you expect of your vacation, this will be fulfilled if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with servers offering on the beach of Pizza, ice and disturbing cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you will find that in abundance.
But only on one island you can find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the large Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their Bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen by a human eye.
Havanna was once taken to a camp or surpassing camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American epoch came.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Construction left it to one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban), was seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among them.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high houses grew, the wide boulevards drove cars, which included the symbols of the 50s of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway purchased a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio Stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autogram.
The bar at the Hotel Nacional mixes cocktails for you.
And the 50's cult cars are driving around in Havanna until today, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long gone apart in the salty and moist air.
May Havanna, especially his oldest part, have been strongly downstairs, nowhere in the vicinity of so many wonderful colonial sights as here.
Other places are just exhausted, such as Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have not only been created in Havanna but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marot that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar tube of remote plantations brought steam and diesel-driven small railways to the sugar factories.
Their driving park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see dull and fully functioning locomotives whose age companions are standing elsewhere in the museum.
Departure targets
The most important places do not leave the majority of Cuba’s visitors out.
This is how you no longer have to write about Varadero or Havana.
Just mention that there is a museum in the already mentioned estate of Hemingways, whose visit should not be missed by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque angles.
The frozen vegetation grows on limestone floors.
The mogotas, calcium hills and rocks, raged steeply from the valley floor, gathered in their hollows fruitable soils, through which also feathered hills are covered by density.
This valley is where the possibly best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean sequence of the "Major Zeman" series was turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Honour and wealth brought her the trade in slaves and sugar.
The wealth represented itself in the delicious beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a distant place that there was no road linked to the rest of the country in the 1950s of the last century.
This isolation helped to disregard it.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was cut off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach of Playa Ancón or the "Tal of the sugar factories".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Musica, who lives after the darkness and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba calls some the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also affected by the way to that.
Both streets leading by Guantánamo must overcome high and crushed mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly affected by human interventions.
These eastern preposts of Cuba, thanks to the unaffected nature there, the UNESCO took up into their world heritage directory.
There the best chocolate is produced, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has arisen about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, several table mountains are seen from which El Yunque is the most known.
About the coffee, the room, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the swine Bay and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, a African religion to which the descendants of slaves confesse, many pages could be written about all this.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Alliances in Afghanistan are passive, claims Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, in accordance with the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, draw up a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go after its ideas, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through their defence minister Robert Gates, called on the NATO units to more activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part of this is to enable the inhabitants to start even the development of the economy and security," says the British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan opposers has, according to the American army, reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violence actions increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even in the southern province of Helmand by 60 per cent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about one quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit as regards the organisation and equipment of units.
In fact, they demand further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
The Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, said similarly today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency for the conclusion of three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In the last few months, there is also a dispute among the countries involved about whether all the allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers Faulpelze this week.
"Afghanian Non-Sturd uncovers: The Germans make games while our boys fight," the "Sun" wrote in a contribution supplemented by photos of German soldiers to play the table tennis.
The German image newspaper went over to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a Rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will speed up to a billion in 2009
Each Czech is a government debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt increased to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt 159.2 billion females this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policies.
The government debts of the Czech Republic increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Thus, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June they have decreased by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its information on State debts from early October.
Every Czech is debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the last year, the state debts over 111 billion crowns.
"Until now it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may only exceed the limit of a billion crown in 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crown," said David Marek, analytic of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, analytics of the Next Finance, sees: "We could come over a billion in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we do not know yet.
If it should be shown that the situation changes at the political stage and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take the year 2010.
But from such a change I don't go out," he said.
Growth of debt
The government debt comes from the debts of the government and is particularly from the accumulation of government deficits.
The government debt is financed by tax instructions, government debt debts, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt increased to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The foreign debts of the State now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average debt debt expired to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how well the economy is.
It is interesting that the growth is noted especially in the debt prescriptions, where the growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," commented Pikora.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the handling of government debts for 2007 show that the government had planned 159,2 billion crowns for this year.
In early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policies.
This amount is based primarily on the government budget deficit, which is obviously going to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum funding for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt debt for 43 billion and the rates for loans at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy Bear, she was presented to a court in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartum on Thursday evening to 15 days and subsequent exile.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be plowed out.
After parents of students had complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary teacher, who worked at the Unity High School of Khartum, was arrested at home on Sunday and, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal law book, accused of the insult of Islam.
In fact, this matter takes her beginning in September when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favorite first names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but in particular also a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the picture of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself had no sign with that name, but the problem is very simple that the presentation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be an offensive of Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well, and she would never have done anything that could have drawn her close to a religious belief, I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name , his opinion is just an innocent mistake .
One opinion that shares numerous students of the teacher who describe them as very careful to her students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
It is remembered that the first name of Mohammed is also the second name given in the UK the most frequently given, for which there are 14 different writings in English.
This often selected first name of Muslim families is considered a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give him a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
On Wednesday, the final negotiation session in Vienna did not reach agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status , explained European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, stressed that peace in the region is at stake, called on them to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
There is no expectation of violence in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are clear tensions.
End of the negotiations on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo last Monday.
The future of the 90% of Albanian speakers could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, have been the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had been given the UN’s mission to a new intermediary since August last.
Americans and Europeans are expecting their contract to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council, will continue the negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains the speaker of a negotiated solution, an acceptable solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After the Kosovo administration of the UN for eight years, western countries maintain independence under EU supervision for the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce this unilateral if the Security Council should not decide for their benefit.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovar rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared its regret.
He added , however , that the plan proposed by Belgrade belonged to the autonomy of a past that led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President, Boris Tradic, was of the opinion that a compromise should always be pursued and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a single-sided declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision would be made solely in the Security Council alone, where Russian allies had a veto law.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
Only one decision in the series of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia , explained the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
They have to end as they started, in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament would have the last word on the status, and added that every unilateral declaration of independence from the sides of the Albanian-speaking population will be in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had been gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final arrangement for the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel has to terminate its colonization work, explained Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the Roadmap which they agreed in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas are ultimately seeking a peace agreement to clarify all open questions without exception, including central issues .
This name includes the three serious problems to which the disputes between Israeli and Palestinians are mainly concerned: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who were displaced from their home in the 1948 conflict, which lies in today's state of Israel.
Following the American President, Abbas took the word and insisted that the coming negotiations should be fully and thoroughly conducted and provide a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word, he committed to conducting the coming weapons stop negotiations directly and without interruption and to endeavor to finish them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and a Israeli vision which exists in addition to each other for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken over by all Arab countries offering Israel peace in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab areas occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a path of divorce in the history of the Middle Orient, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points, says the Saudi-Arabic Prince in his interview with the Arabic newspaper financed by Saudi money.
According to the State Prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this type of local news, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), a police car was driven on Sunday, shortly after 17 a.m., on the Rue Louise-Michel to Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no operation, but was on line, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explained a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, thus not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, driven with very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car, after it had neglected its advance from the right, a policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out in the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (beaten wings, shattered windshields, shattered straps) shows the tightness of the cracking.
Very fast, yesterday morning, the State Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontose, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she instructed the IGPN to investigate "the facts of the non-voluntary person murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger" in conformity with the main rejecting guidance for the public security of Val-d'Oise.
On the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excluded the detection of the IGPN in this stage of the police.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were listened to Sunday night, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel has arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of riffing, surely caused by the squeezing of the footsteps on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had been shaken together until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obduced yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel quickly made a rumor the round, so the police would have left the accident location very quickly, and that without providing help to the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude this matter with regard to any serious mistakes.
According to a police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are needed and which must be carried out very carefully .
Libération met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, right away to try to live her again, tells this Witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman hanging.
Two more attempted to resurrect one of the young people who called fourth .
In view of the excitement that had quickly emerged about the occurrence and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the present people had about the unforeseen situation of young people, the police were taken into the car of colleagues who arrived at the accident site.
Still, according to this witness statement, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police left.
You have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I won't let it be claimed that the police forces did not help the young people.
The first help has been made to these youths.
The fire force has arrived immediately.
It was done everything to try to rescue her, she stressed the prosecutor.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations, since two days earlier, General Musharraf had proclaimed the distress.
According to witness statements, some 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken under the emergency were injured in the city of Lahore in the east of the country by the tears of gas granates that the order forces used there.
They then threw stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and hurt lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad the lawyers of the Supreme Court's lawyers have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by opposers, instructors of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Further demonstrations would have been found in Multan (Midden) and in Peshawar (Northern East).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the mighty Alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president invited the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the distress, and to the waste that had sworn before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promises are no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday night.
In the following days, he had to take a stand on the legality of President Musharraf in a direct election on 6 October.
The chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anticonstitutional and contradictory to the decisions of the Supreme Court, explained the Magistrate of the newspaper.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the chief command on the army and to become a civil president no longer applies since the call on the emergency status, explained Monday the Vice-Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ends as president.
The Vice-Minister for Information has also confirmed that the elections could be deferred from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government demented the reputations that persist in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place to stay by his alternate army leader.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Today, 40 years after adoption of the Newwirth Law which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as shown by a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account the adverse pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years using the pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of contraception has yet allowed better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned today.
For one out of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems the most pleasant to get a child.
spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector, which is essential for continuing scientific work on the station.
A guarded exit that, due to its duration, the removal of resident modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when astronauts had unloaded the Module Harmony from the Space Travel Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part that will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17,5 tons heavy module for power generation via solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After she moved it, the crew restructured the solar collektors of the module, whose range is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that can appear like accordeons was damaged by a cable embossed at a length of about one meter
The restructuring has been stopped to avoid further damage to the collector.
The astronauts who originally leave the space drive Discovery for a control course and then should repair another sun collector whose rotation system was wrong, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the space crafts that had been placed on the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old trained doctor was therefore chosen to operate the injured sun collector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he separated the defective cable and firmed a kind of rail on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who remained near the locks, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, Commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a mini hockey striker, wrapped with isolator to prevent an electrical battle on the sun collections that produce several hundred volts, the astronauts had found and built on the station.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully taught before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the space ride Discovery to expect the return to the earth on Wednesday.
Title EADS sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the group of aviation and defence has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counteract the remains of the A400M, the EADS share currently shows a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently EADS loses 4% on 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again referring to the residues caused by the only slowly progressive development of the A400M engine which delays the fly's virgin flight.
The costs announced in October in order to compensate for the delay in delivering their military transport aircraft amounted to between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus , the mother group of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
As a result of these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month residue.
For memory, the EADS business performance fell from 86% in 2006, essentially due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of A400M to the French Army for October 2009.
The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very locked election campaign, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even of authoritarism.
Three days before parliamentary elections, the Russian President, Mr Wladimir Putin, will send a message to the voters whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his characteristic as a top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday the President had nothing to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and satisfied with delivering a new attack point against the Western powers which are accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the perspective of the opposition, they have become there.
She is practicing a championship contaminated by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations last weekend, for ex-Sacher World Champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorized demonstrations had been sentenced to five days in prison, according to his lawyer, the ban on visit.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these Parliament elections without excitement, two very far-reaching questions arise:
Who will join Putin's successor as president?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the Presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make their public until 23 December.
Since he elected 2000 and was reelected in 2004, Wladimir Putin cannot join a third mandate in success.
And now there is no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of the majority of Parliament and the Almighty Party of the United Nations Russia, which will elect government and President?
Whatever it will be, when it comes to parliamentary or presidency elections, the previous power will triumphate.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: the civil society has delayed the development of individuality in this country, which has been Christed five centuries after Europe, very slowly.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, as this new paternalism did not follow a terror but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians abstain from free pieces of personal responsibility which they have shown shortly after the decade of the USSR.
What do you think about for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional chairmen) are leading the local election lists of the United Russian.
The new liberties that come from the West are often similar to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What do you think about for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad, why do they resolve?
A Heavy Memorial
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless they were intended for humanitarian purposes, that is, individually and namely, on the question of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, have agreed to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Holy Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, the director of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these named documents accessible to the public because of the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the claimed homosexuality or the spiritual disability of some deportation sacrifices.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo had been gathered for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who were deported or subjected to compulsory work, and to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to bring them the way to their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are working tens of thousands of personal requests.
However, part of the scientific community shows limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to expect fundamental new in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, explained in 2006.
The EU and India want to obtain a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is the most important trade partner in India and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
European Minister for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, argued that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is the first trade partner of India and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but, according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trade partner of the EU.
A free trade covenant will bring the two economic spaces forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, explained by the European Commission. The Asian and European giants exchange annual goods of EUR 47 billion and services at the value of EUR 10 billion this week, Daniéle Smadja, President of the European Commission's Delegation in New Delhi, explained and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential.The EU and India meet their eighth diplomats in New Delhi, at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso on Friday.

The Bank of England takes note of the disturbance and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current recourse to the credit conditions, and announced a ten billion pounds offer with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears in which the financial market conditions will be particularly hard at the end of the year and to give banks a greater certainty of how to organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase that begins on 6 December, in the form of an open-market operation for five weeks, in a communication.
The Bank continues to explain that on 6 December, GMT 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be circulated, to the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE brings liquids in circulation for five weeks in an open-market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbank loans from day to day with their basic interest rate.
The different interbank interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been rated to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums brought by the Bank of England have been linked to punishment fees that the banks had prevented from taking them in.
According to certain rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many would prefer to sign for the sums brought in by the European Central Bank, to more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS’s proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre Groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Legislative Proposal for Purchasing Power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text developed under a socialist nisch (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) stated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which the majority of 50% of the employment allowance, the re-introduction of the TIP fleet, a transport check or the restriction of rents.
After UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main discussion, which resulted in partially violent word exchanges between majority and opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution on purchasing power.
The leader of the members of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will present the total of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the finances which the Assamblee had reviewed last week.
A new festival is born
Following a number of rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to cooperate with a person who, no longer and not less, served as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 informed on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will be held from August 8-10 on a 500 acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic of Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the most renowned festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to the Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, the Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production, license concessions and organising tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, Glastonbury, described as the most inspiring event at which he has ever been present, says that his company and Melvin Benn work parallelly in order to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We chose Philadelphia as a market and cooperate with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city center of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We held negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in police debates on current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in the Grand Park of Chicago, after it was in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to achieve 9.8 million dollars and 11.8 million dollars in gross tax days in 2007.
These two festivals take place in a urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, whereas the ours are rather placed on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts together in some way, in order to simultaneously communicate the impression of a rural festival to the European and a city in the American way."
Vineland is approximately halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to pay the terms of the Convention, but he confirms that they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed before they were printed.
"Vinland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of viewers," says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Bollboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator opposes it.
These lock attempts are part of the delegated tasks.
A political "hiikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who claims "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the Guvernor?
"You need to be careful because it's the industry that decides where to go.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who you think are best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the preliminary priority of the cinema there is at the moment.
The hunting for the Oscars started.
At all the festival on the west coast, although that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about presenting the films from Quebec to evaluate them and ensure that the producers are interviewed.
The dark age had a successful idea at the 30rd Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be presented on the 30rd Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange ahead of a final year rally? Disagreement with experts due to the U.S. hypothesis crisis
With nearly five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, the investors are already shaking their hands with regard to the coming end-year Rally.
However, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that the month of December usually involves a positive market development.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to draw up short-term forecasts and only based on statistics.
Although other experts do not approve such a strong increase in the course during the last few weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which is mainly invested in pension funds, which are strongly affected by the progressive trend towards profitable assets.
Accordingly, these experts believe that the stock exchange will have a more lateral trend affected by market changes, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decrease in the rate of interest rate of the US note bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rise in the raw oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the BPI sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a vigilant time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analytist at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with nearly 16,000 points as a result of the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional funding carried out by this time.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year things could develop something different, especially because of the final year rally that is already taking place in the second December week, and then directly after the bridge day on the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price changes would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analytist at the Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at almost technical level, which could soon result in a deviation from the index values, depending on the consequences of the U.S. hypothesis crisis.
The analytist is confident that these are positive.
When selecting the values to promote the Ibex to new maximum values, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney delights that this year are the big values in order.
One of the value winners would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, since the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha is assured by the Bank Inversis that the increases in the bank and industry will be associated.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACPs have been on a recovery course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, says the expert.
As regards the increase in consumer behaviour during Christmas days, market events will be determined in the last half of the year of periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive turnover results even if they are only in a small number in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
During the last seven years, the December only showed in two cases decline in courses.
When the technology blow was placed at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 percentage points, the December showed a rate rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth profitable year in sequence (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and also a final year rally will be shown.
Popularly, his 200 credit institutions will open 12 hours a day from Monday to Friday.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
Overall 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute that operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, since Popular as the first banking group dare the jump to extend the opening hours of its branches weekly until 20.30 p.m. and start on Saturdays from 10 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The BBVA group, which also read repeatedly the extension of its opening periods in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The current negotiations by the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement at which 75% of all branches will be closed on Saturday and open for it on one week afternoon, although not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative adapting to business opening times will depend on the Popular Bank's experience values.
And just that is also the intention to follow the Popular with its project.
The aim is to extend the opening periods of those branches, which, due to their situation, can cover the commercial customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will reform the spaces of the establishments already in business zones and will simultaneously adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus the extension of opening times is linked to a new space design of branches, which is characterized by a more recent, colorful design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring does not require larger investments, but has been associated with an increase in staff position, since a branch has no longer been required six but eight or nine employees.
The establishments, even equipped with additional spaces for SMEs, will not sell any financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience values were positive, so Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and the Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular is currently running about 2500 branches.
And more 60 people who operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of BBVA is not used, since most of them will provide a wide range of non-financial services for sale instead.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
They have agreed provisionally with telephonica to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish Private Sender Telecinco doubles his stock exchange value for the first time and thus overreachs his Rivalen Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the end of the stock exchange. The transmitter guided by him had increased his value by the double of his rival antena 3.
However, one aspect weakened his joy: that is exactly what hurts me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he found.
He stressed that they have not fallen too deeply despite the weak market.
Telecinco ended yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches €4.88.88 million, with mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%) and Vocento is only involved with 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has registered a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other börsnotated communications companies rises; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (representer of Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, says Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still appears to be the extent to which we can actually operate in stocking, at which price and how we can make it profitable at customer level.
Telecinco explained a week ago his project to rise to the first television station this year with over 1000 million gross profits from advertising. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the transmitter would increase its advertising coins by 3.6% compared to 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine marketing months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor in the improved market history of Telecinco is the analysis of the high payout ratio that the company could have until the present time: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría caused a 100% dividend emission.
However, Vasile assures that after buying 33% of the shares of endmol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for official notification.
We are obliged to compensate for at least 50% of the shares, even if we have given a significant increase in the number of shares.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we could already increase by buying from 33% of the end-mol shares.
According to analytists, the market is currently experiencing certain trends of loss.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco with 4% this year and with 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on its high efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (cooping) is more advantageous than Antena 3 (keeping) because of the many incentives and the prospering market.
3.
JPM organ: Recommended in view of similar threats (saturated market and poorer economic climate) to reduce expectations in both cases
The Convention agrees with the MIFID Directive which entered into force on 1 November.
Parallel to Parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Congress decision in the Senate on the additional/change applications related to the project, the government published the provisions of the new law in order to allow the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commend the efforts of Congress and Senate delegates who had pursued the objective of their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible scheme to ensure investors' security and regulate individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure a general efficient market behaviour.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-determines the securities service regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services undertakings (ESIS) to the advisory companies connected with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
Furthermore, it extends the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions, so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral systems of the effectiveness business and to the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually be competing with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to disclose the focus of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the market and to register all projects carried out to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
The Congress's Economic Commission also provided further changes, and the decision that the debt debt decree provided with titles must now be seen as a complex fund for the investor due to its high risk level, confirmed by the U.S. hypothesis and banking crisis. (US hypothesis crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the fields of qualified economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation restricted the fields of work reserved for economic scientists was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate set out new positions in the financial sector, such as those of the economic mediator who works on foreign account, cannot be authorized by the CNMV and can provide its services for the commercialisation of products and for customer gain at the same time with several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (PPI) increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.1%.
The indicator that Eurostat serves to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare local and quality comparisons with U.S. products.
The forecast for the indicator can be produced prematurely by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modeling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) admonished that the indicator identified in advance served only as a guide value, and therefore did not need to agree with the final result announced on 14 December.
Consumer Price Index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Pedro Solbes , the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November ; at the same time , it assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes found in the halls of the Congress building that even though the current number is not good , the difference between Spain and the other members of the Monetary Union has remained more or less equal in recent years .
He also explained that there were less surprises in November than in the previous month, where the government did not expect such an increase.
We expected a value of approximately 4% , announced by the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
The value stocks of Northern Rock have decreased by more than half after the Bank in mid-September last year had asked the British Notenbank for an emergency credit, and they are now only 12 000 million pounds (this is EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets were recorded at 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has been significantly reduced within two and a half months by the customer’s trust loss and even despite the government's hundred percent guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis will continue to fall.
The company Virgin, who would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to enter about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed of the investments of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds which are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of the multimillionary Richard Branson, known by his outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to flow in advertising and marketing campaigns in order to achieve its goal annually.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as his preferred tenderer to lead it out of the insolvency.
The mayor of Todana arrested for suspected participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) town of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, present Member of the Partido Popular and at the time Chairman of the municipality of Totana, and could be the original collaborator of the conspiracy, according to information by the broadcaster Cadena SER.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and of the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information of the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore the privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested in leaving his client's residence due to important burdenful documents that are to be related to the complot.
In addition, other sources of information reports of the supposed order payments of Morales to a Galician construction company that intended to conclude a urban contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares large area was decided.
At present, eight people are investigated.
Bono agrees to adopt the PSOE's candidateship in Toledo and, in case of a election victory, at the convention.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the President and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and will therefore refer to the list of PSOE candidates at the next general elections in Toledo and, in the event of the socialists' victory, take over the office of the Congress President.
So it announced José Blanco, the organisation secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the party's headquarters.
The Head of Government believes that the offer to the former minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the case of a victory for socialists, the Mancha politicians would appear to be the president of the Party in the elections to come.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress president, which had announced last 15 November that he would no longer enter into the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead take part in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his retirement two years ago, the President of the Government has constantly pressed on his return to political events.
Moreover , he pointed out that the party , as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs , did not want to keep the citizens in mind who would take over the posts of the Congress Chairman in the event of an election victory , and described this as an act of transparency .
If he really should take over the office, he hopes that the chamber will become a house of respect, not the insult or the cry, to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time you gain the impression that the only place in which you can't speak quietly and left in Madrid is the convention; so the government president in the Senate has been interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and suggested that he would not give rise to the appearance of having already taken over the office, since otherwise his political counterparties would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate underlines both the skeptics of climate change and those who emphasize a social and political debate in this regard, the movement must show strong cohesion as a whole.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of the government president Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new Treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings it in an emergency of declaration on the action or non-trading of its government, which has contributed vitally to the fact that Spain is at the top of the EU in the countries that have at least satisfied the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Those who are responsible for not complying with the requirements, which are the sectors that are the result of this, and why has its government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to Spanish citizens the measures proposed by him to combat climate change without delay.
What companies are concerned about the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective savings measures and the economic consequences of them.
Exactly, who must sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
For the measures that can be taken really against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the benzine centre proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared strategicly so dangerous that he felt that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now true to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty speeches without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politicians who otherwise are suitable for electoral campaigns must neither speak, nor accuse, nor demand, but instead check the demanding edition, decorate the meetings, and enthusiasm others with his meekness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the Treaty does not differ from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not predict that the bicycle will be the only means of movement in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a facility.
The mayor and police chief of Todana due to a suspected development in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the village of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police officer, the Secretary of the Mayor Office, and a hotel entrepreneur due to the presumed suspicion of urban infringements, said today from research circles.
The City Council was arrested at its residence, from where it was brought to the municipality and in its rooms until the present time, surrounded by many agents who were also encountered in the urban administration and the municipal construction office of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the flags already taken on Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of unresolved construction for urban projects under the management of the Galician construction company Nuaria were to be reorganized, which should build 4000 apartments on the ground after the local administration had received illegal provisions during the last legislature period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subject to an investigation procedure, which is caused and carried out by the First Court of Justice of Totonas.
The first six arrested people have been presented to the judge today.
According to research circuits, the former mayor of Todana and the current independent PP delegate Juan Morales are also identified.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current, residual friend in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigran (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose companies are supposed to have functioned as a part group of Nuaria and received the measuring money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry industry, which is supposed to have acted as a mediumman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, one golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired more than 2.2 million square kilometres of area to be rebuilt in Totana. The aim was to achieve a construction project which would increase the population of the community to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specialized in promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression Book of the month and instead try to invent a price-name of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is still at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; randomly on that day, the issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy section has become after the tragedy about the school of Jokela topic of public debate.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturian who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, the Chairman of the Educational Council for the Philosophy Department, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position to Plato and suggested to delete Platon's teachings from the undergraduate teaching plans for the philosophy of gymnasia.

A colleague informed about the entry of illegal Internet downloads into the criminal law:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of law, which would be arrested at six months.
However, once again, if you rob a musical business under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of EUR 1000, the steal will be a penalty rate, but the penalty will be less than a download (Article 234 of the penalty law).
C. If you clamp a car and return it forty hours later, then the punishment is still lower than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a struggle than in a musical data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious controversy is a prison penalty of three to 12 months (Article 154 of the Criminal Law), while the exchange of data results in a freedom withdrawal of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Law).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the criminal law book, sexual harassment at work is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not taken place by the authors is exposed to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, somebody has screwed up his demands quite well.

My home doctor will give me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from monthly salary are dependent on the salaries of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn and the results were published in the last edition of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirn Research Centre Life&Brain, activation was then the strongest if the participants gave correct answers and his fellow player failed.
The researchers could see that the brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct with their answer and received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, it also became a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
State prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been innocent for eight years after the criminals of the Balkan wars. Their office is located in La Haya's State Prosecutor of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, since the chief officers of the massacre of Srebrenica - at the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims killed - the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bossian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the free foot.
Their names are on the list that Marcel Schüpbach, who is from Switzerland, has not yet entered the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, Spain); a film that, with the pace of a Polit-Thriller, follows the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in its project to detect the escaped criminals and to put pressure on the respective governments to close their networks.
What insurance is best suited for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible injury caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, which, once again, depends on different factors, including age, gender, date of production of the driver's licence, family status, type of car to be assured and its use, etc.
Making a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the correct vehicle model.
First of all, you have to be clear what we're dealing with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This Agreement shall be held in writing by means of an insurance contract stating that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to submit the corresponding sum of recovery in case of an injury.
The insurance premium is the price of a insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of the establishment of a licence, family status, type of vehicle to be assured or used.
Insurers shall determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher risks of accidents will also result in higher contribution payments.
For this reason, both over 25-year-old and women have to make less contribution payments, because statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also after the convictions of companies, tend to less accidents than alone.
The benefit to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
In the preparation of the premium, insurance must take account of a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs most.
We are now listening to the most important points that should be considered in the selection of insurance, not only in order to make a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The less than 25-year-olds, when selecting a price-effective insurance, take many obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete full-risk insurance, there are more price-worthy alternatives.
The cautious drivers can choose a full casco with self-interest, so that the benefits of full-casco insurance are covered, but at a low price.
This type of contract involves that the customer must pay part of the amount which has been caused by the damage itself.
The amount is fixed before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher depending on the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the principal representative of Spain at First Europe, a contracting company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that insures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are less than 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic tariff in the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of credits and penalties depends on the company and their earnings.
If the company has a viable year behind it, it can allow to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most useful to decide for a full-risk insurance with self-egoing.
Usually youths cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of an accident and at the time of the ride , explain the Spanish head of the European company and add that the majority of the accidents occur during the second year of practice after the beginning’s fear has been deployed.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who has no children to complete full-risk insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the corresponding person.
Insured couples with children are considered to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore low are their contribution payments.
In this case, full-risk insurance would be the best option (with a amount of EUR 300). In the case of a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is only used for the third year of vehicles.
They are driving more relaxed and have a larger purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For pensioners, it is possible to complete a full-risk insurance with self-equity (with an amount of 150 euros) or to complete an extended insurance that is only used at sufficiently high credit.
Finally, you must note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it stores high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan on the point for the eighthfinale
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight in San Siro on the next Tuesday for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals before the finish of the Championsleague Front. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while it decides about their participation in the Scots.
The Italian team has already five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a dispute in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points requires another one to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not collect the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth play round, since the FC Milan will have to join the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where it will fight at the 13th half-final for the first time for the entry into the final which will take place on the 16th.
Thus this group will be completed in front of all others and the distinct in Guiseppe Meazza Stadion will be the expected result, even if both teams will try to win. For the Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow know that they would have a better starting position in the Achtelfinale in case of a victory group first.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be able to defeat in a slack of the FC Shakhtar to qualify. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because at nine points equality the Ukrainians are allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the mailers will try to miss the scots on the evening. Once again, they hope to reach the eighthfinale of the transformed championsleague for the second time in the past season, after they were defeated in exactly the same round through a gate of cake in the afterlife (1-0) and by a zero to zero Unavoided on the replay.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as the achievement of the eighthfinal as well as its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, the Benfica Lisbon could take the third place by a victory and thus join the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls gave in the Canadian Vancouver 20,000 viewers the start shot for their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained that the mood in the reunited band was excellent just before the beginning of her concert at GM Place de Vancouver.
About 20,000 people were able to experience the concert at the out-saled stadium, where a video was shown on the story of the band that had provided birds at the end of the 1990s.
The reunification and the world tournament are crossed by the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hit and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appear in Spain under the label of the EMI.
The five members of the spice girls carried golden armbands on the stage, which had previously given them to the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses of the audience that brought the GM Palace to glory, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden him in the past days.
While preparing for the shoe, Victoria Beckham stated that the British star has not seen our garderobe once, and so I'm very excited about what he's going to think of.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 due to internal differences two years later moved the resolution of the group, expressed its nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world publicity had changed, that the feelings had changed to the spice girls.
And so I thought why not, so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed itself on the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes have been eliminated and now everyone has been very happy again.
Yet, many things have changed since the last common appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First of all, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special machine from Virgin Airlines, according to the report by the television broadcaster.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received from a army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
Following the concert in Vancouver, the band will next occur in California, San José (December 4,) and Los Angeles (December 5, and December 7.) in the United States.
They will enter the stage in Madrid on December 23th.
New fears about gas disputes between Russia and Ukraine
A new price struggle swells between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe are affected.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are directed by Ukraine and each dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that when Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will take account of higher transit fees by Russia.
A previous conflict between the two states last year reduced delivery to the EU states.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state gasmonopol Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be calculated more, since the group agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analytists say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoli Chinakh of Reuters news agency.
"The change in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments on the level of transit fees [to West Europe] through Ukraine."
In January 2006, in the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom shortened deliveries to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplements his own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-punishment registers of workers from outside Europe, said a member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the principal financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns about the fact that the Scottish State Health Service did not provide accurate ideas about the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample by five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28th, a Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transfer, and was charged in connection with the presumed autobombing attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service shall carry out controls in advance of the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to verify pre-punishment registers, the Agency does not have the power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The main auditor's report now, in addition to other recommendations, states that the Board of Directors should adopt guidelines for the criminal register extract, which help employers in controls in different countries.
"While we have found evidence of these checks in some personal documents, these have not been routinely carried out." the report stated.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research directives with a high degree before employment, but added: "Our report shows areas in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that accurate information is available about the number of foreign healthcare workers."
BMA Schotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks in front of the employment of potential NHS employees.
"The report says that current preliminary tests of the NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign employees, the major majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, even because the boards had difficulties to identify those employees who were entitled to indefinitely.
The investigation continued to note that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were mainly respected.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification controls.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines on controls prior to the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern to me to perform this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that, in conjunction with the health authorities, the Scottish Government would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on the control investigations in the preliminary field of the appointment of all employees - including those from abroad - would be planned to be published next month.
Joy Division dominates film pricing
Control, the film biography over the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has collected five prices at the British Independent Film Festspiele, including for the best movie.
Prices were also given to the principal actors of Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of the Curtis, to the director Anton Corbijn, and to the advisor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded as the best main actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond director Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for having put the British film into the world's publicity.
The prices were given in a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis rise to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 with 23 years.
The black-white film - on its soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was turned for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has introduced two prices to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, the best known for the culty cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best governor.
Rock music was the focus of another prizemaker at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film via the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the price for the best documentary film.
The price for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafiabosse in David Cronenberg in London, playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris price for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old whose films are Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beest, currently films the Indiana Jones Continue The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the price, named for the honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney, who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actress of his time, I'm really honoured."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group, including filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terror comploy
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells that had planned a future attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle missiles.
Sympathists of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a allyte of the United States since 2003, due to the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, listed by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man strong railway troop to protect installations after a misleading Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an inter-ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "raket expert" who illegally emigrated into the country.
He reports that the military had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, other 22 prisoners had predicted to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis, who seeks Iraq to join Al Qaida Milizen, who want to fight the allies of armies and the US-supported Shitish Muslim Government, which is considered here by the Hardliners under the Sunitian Saudi.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia in collaboration with the authorities in support of the royal family politics that dominate the government.
The military - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader, born in Saudi Arabia, aimed at the pro-western Saudi government - have taken advantage of foreign residential areas, government buildings and plants of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort for the security forces over the last... five months," a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior informed the state television.
The arrests also addressed a "media cell" of 16 Medina, which aimed at advertising the "Takfiri Think" - the ideology of radical Sunitian Muslims, who supports violence against Muslims, which are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the military.
The climate on the Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a railway shows that the planet is even more similar to a disturbed twin of the earth than was aware to date.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary paths, but the Venus of the sun is slightly closer.
billions of years ago would have dominated the Venus conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even have been inhabitable, believes scientists today.
However, because of the unbremsed carbon dioxide driving house effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sun radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus entered a completely different development course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has an surface temperature which is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space zone of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, provide a frustrating view of how the earth could develop in view of the disastrous climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that of the earth, while the planets are quite similar otherwise."
"Our new data enable us to construct a scenario where the Venus started billions of years ago like the earth, perhaps with a inhabitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" entangled by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reported by enriched uranium, was confiscated by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Everything still open
In the middle of Romey, he said he was not worthy of a presidential candidate to be consulted by a stagann.
Yet, the Republican candidate finally declared himself ready for the Presidency to ask for a debate on YouTube in which normal voters take up and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday evening, November 28, were as ridiculous as the Schtagann, the democratics asked about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the CNN producers who supported the debate, which selected YouTube Clips to show the candidates to show.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest of which was devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The subject is one of the most important topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of uncircumcised voters to use a choosing disc when they heard things that pleased them: The television department noticed tops of consent when the candidates were strictly speaking about the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national precursor, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation that he had been gentle about illegal immigration when he was the mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to have set up illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly violently distinguished as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an announcement (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congress Assembly, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Assistant from Colorado, succeeded in achieving this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances of nominating, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have previously and harder than others hailed on the immigration pauk.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share the same views in general: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with anxiety about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
However, the debate was clearly addressed in a problematic manner than other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drunkenness should be considered to be torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is a favorite book, he may not believe the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations at first place in a recent survey in Iowa, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to promote Jesus, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extraordinarily open.
Hokkabees rise in Iowa, together with Ron Paul's latest donations, and his congratulations in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot out of nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincedly united with a victorious message about the size of America and a twinker to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another grave to fall in; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slimmer.
No noble titles seem to be sold, no politician paid Paris's hotel bills, no extramarital tones were lured.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has swallowed donations to the British Government Labour Party over over $650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without what the controversial Gordon Brown would have done well.
When the Prime Minister had rejected the demand for a election two months ago, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion surveys had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust and efficient government.
Rather, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharply deputy chairman of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown from Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The unfit salvation of Northern Rock, a bank injured, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgments under shot.
Badly thought proposals to amend tax laws have brought up corporate associations against the government.
The tax-authority loss of personal data of 25 million people showed inevitable administrative pulping.
A Trio of Retired Generals started a rebellion in the upper house of protest against reductions in military expenditure: to be military ministers, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labour (and their former leader of fulfillment) has already retired.
Nothing of this means that Brown breaks in irrevocable direction of departure.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel that it is impossible to rule.
Neither people may trust politicians, but they usually stop their skepticism when a new troop takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he will not even have to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service begins to become unlikely; the cabinet minister begins to talk; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and goalless.
In some ways, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new beetle.
If he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his Lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax competence documents, for example, are related to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misconduct - as with the long "guilt for noble titles" examination of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was it.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely cheated.
And the countermeasure, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown's naturally stalinistic tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new beauty of political donations is a good example.
The Garboean Abraham, who compares his donations with his generous gifts, does not wish public recognition for his well-being.
That may be the case, but the decision did not allow him to do so.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who are rulers of the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial operator, which was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
However, Brown has not been involved so far: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by taking into account a well-known instrument, an investigation committee on the subject - to fill the measure, by a bishop in retirement and by a judge.
In this case, "the teachings to be drawn out" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
In addition to this, there are other things Mr Brown must do, as to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in public life, who has been unoccupied for six months, and progress with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly quit the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party companion like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion surveys; it has two years to return to voters; and the only way to achieve a victory is by incontested integrity and solid competence.
Card Shark
Does the credit crisis turn on America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that back bottles revolve excitedly around.
Now that America's real estate market is injured, the robbers have the country's credit card market in vision.
Analyticals of Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of inflammation of underfunded loans spreads to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the seam rates that measure the share of loans which are not attractable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced last month that it took a $1.4 billion fee survey from its American consumer financing, partly because of the weakness of credit card users.
It's still too early to get panic.
Losses and seams are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarteral sewing rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration of the rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US Private Insolvency Law in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy applications, which, in turn, constitute a large part of the credit card losses; the number of applications (and thus seam fees) would rise again, whether the general conditions for creditors are worsening or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates which show how much of its debt the consumer pays every month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong despite the stop in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the output volumes for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infectious channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will take credit card debts, now that home credits are drying out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the flow of money instead of on capital values, so falling house prices do not necessarily resolve a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of advantage for the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage rates fall if the property is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, the card debts under the return priorities become more important.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and flexibler than credit providers to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones' main financial reference.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable decline are significantly more real.
If lower domestic prices and a reduction in the credit reduces America into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly be faced with a more violent future.
Keep them looking for these sharks.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be put before court for their role in the deceitful system with the former principal financial leader of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded on innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for supposed conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was initiated on January.
However, during a hearing before the court before the US District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior each pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during two-year delivery procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation initiated after Enron's crash in 2001.
The accusations submitted initially against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the objective of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to hire a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron-machiencies who contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it really had a significant value.
A company under Copper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Copper $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper and others dissolved about $12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004 Fastow confessed in two accusations of conspiracy for his role in Enron's plague.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a 6-year prison in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Copper is a three-year punishment and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot because of a $1 million deposit, which required them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke in bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer cover the billion debts or make weakening businesses seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than $2 billion pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collaboration.
Skilling depends on a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays sentences for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were invalid after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a rolls royce motor and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But that's small money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one of you asks for so many seats because it is for a private family or a business president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand on the last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day orgie of the consumption, which was organised in a neglected exhibition centre on the edge of the capital city.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibitions, hoping to interested new Russians in everything, from mahagoni-tapped yachts to diamond-drawn car grills, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a shiny orange porch at the next fair stand in the vision.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be as flooded with money as Dallas at its glorious times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to huge wealth and went to a crowd of people to Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Euratic studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible editions of money in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the gold straw.
Otherwhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, has been attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high-price goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, belonging to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires who have a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are part of the second class, which is totally worth $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts in the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert organisation here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15,8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London Jewelier.
She had visited the fair for the first time with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary cared for and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they move Sunday night in evening clothing through the halls, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, describe themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I have looked at the cars and I try to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who was delivering the designer dress she was wearing, like a red carpet veneer with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new ranges, the type of brand-conscious Russian purchasers who would be ready to stand several hours in stand to visit an accompanied warehouse, which unpleasantly put Cadillac Escalades, pocket knive from Platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, customized biliards, appartments in Dubai and Gund Teddy Bears next to each other.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patrioticly at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a wall-size imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climper climbers."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from great tracking logos to the type of naughty brand with limited numbers of pieces that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Yet several thousand people, whether millionaires, missionaries of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds here, said that he had sold two $70,000 matratzensets made of silk, cashmir and cotton, with enclosed gold garments.
Similarly in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a selling manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, that his company had sold the grilled orange porch for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company adapting luxury cars to customer wishes, said that he would sell three car cooler grilles for a rolls-Royce Phantom, which is linked to each other, for $55.000.
He showed a reporter a car math developed for a Russian casino owner, with spices he had covered with coloured Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a routine-letterad.
The costs: $22,000 for a fourth.
"The Russian millionaire, the street leather wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic circonium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will store it in his 30- or 40-waves garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusiveity at the moment in view of the rise in the real estate prices.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on the paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a position operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells according to British model, which were full-stoped with mountains of false million dollar cards.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passengers stopped to throw around the money hops, mobile photos, while they rejected in the middle of the replacement wealth, let friends knock, or simply to insert a few million.
"Behold, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr Karryev.
Suspected surgery at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Harvest Thanksgiving as Ronald Livingston through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched as an ambulance at the White Cape Cod held two doors down at the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another thing.
"Then I saw the box car of the doctor's body viewer arrive," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"This was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearers learned that the dead lady Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the director of the Newarker Police Department.
Now the detectives are trying to find out whether she died because of a procedure conducted by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify and who worked at the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet detected what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to explain a mysterious death that sent a grief through the headquarters of the Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo has been a assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-taking," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the alcohol control mission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that detectives would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgery treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not reported much about their investigation or about the owner of the house listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The detectives are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a whirled rosen tree is in the close front garden and a Dalmatiner bounced behind the house.
A blue fiss described with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanillas in food and parfums - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading into the under floor.
Two mountain bikes were hanging from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable and helped him to remedy himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or those," he said.
"She was always here when I came here and she was here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Central Bank will reduce interest rates will lead to increasing world share markets
The stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm down the credit markets by further interest reductions, strengthened by the vice-president of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets grew in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Central Bank, said that the policy "flexible and pragmatic" would have to respond to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure devastating markets, in view of the signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulencies "partly had reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increase in turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further exacerbation of the financial conditions for consumers and companies, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to intervene and with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest reductions to stabilise the credit conditions.
The statements also helped to reassure the Wall Street, in view of other bad news from the US economy, now as sales of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of financial turbulencies were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global workers, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for severe losses from their lost bets in the US hypothesis credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts in London will disappear, where the bank is employed 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13.289,40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent, to conclude at 6.306,2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standards.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 per cent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
The reappearance of credit pressure on the markets was previously underlined after strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks was granted to considerable 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed further capital in the money markets in London increased when the credit voltages saw the three-month "Libor" rates for loans between UK banks by 6.59 percent to their highest since late September, after continuous increase since 21 November.
England faces a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to be the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who is going to make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the elections, is here at least under this special title, to help the chief trainer Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morries, the English business leader, is gradually filled with applications for national electors, if not even for which in part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sports is without doubt.
It is never easy to nail precisely what enables a person to reach the top of his occupational branches, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good conclusions that know the business well.
Who can say what the right class for a cricket player is, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but chances also have.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a fighter must get regular chances of order if he wants to make impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season better than, for example, than James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself healthy and how the wind boils into the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with each 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hopes for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium, only one question of opinion can be.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still fighting to firm himself, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he pointed a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah's greater experience of Boparas' youthful enthusiasm after a further discussion during today's network session.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his shiny and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indians in the test in Lord, his homeatarena as a player from Middlesex, and this, along with his immediate rejection of the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the turn from his battles, which were still obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, the All-Scaner from Essex has a delight to live.
It was impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his position was distant when he had recently overwhelmed a four-wheel vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his vodaphone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammates Alastair Cook, who had watched this from the distance, and with enthusiasm saying, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he conics his middle rate with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit to him and strikes with confidence and skill.
Choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Perhaps this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Baghdad, with a stream of displaced persons whose money or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had driven out of their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Baghdad," said Saba Al-Qubaisi, a sunite doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, as regards the militant clergy militia of Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to set his powers back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiitian teacher from the principal Sunnitic part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraqer did not allow to work.
His Shiitian neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local military supported by the United States has contributed to expeling Al-Qaida from their basement in the west of the capital, and pressed him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunitian and Shiitian tribe, who had been displaced from his house in Slekh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with handgranates after he had invited his fellow citizens to combat Al-Qaidas.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the Anti-Al-Qaida Miliz in Slekh and that they need my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said that they had been attracted by the increasing rest in the capital since the US troops rise and growth of local "groups affected" who armed and, in cooperation with the U.S. military, defend their city districts.
But more talked about being forced home by visa problems and decorative money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraq had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father three times, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, who requested Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the secccurious death swadrons in the country.
"We went well to visit Al-Maliki Syria, and the government pressed the Iraqians to no longer give visas to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunitian pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnites were displaced from Shitian residential areas and reversed, resulting in the creation of many places where tensions were left behind.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will re-sect sective tensions and conflicts will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saar countries press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've been telling a non-Saarland for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posted the smallest state self-inially at its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the educational system of the Saarland, which is located in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
So the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can complete their study with a double or even three-fold diploma.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, the country children also bring the Saarland to the universities in an over-mean number - many of them without graduating at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Pünncke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his study rights at a vocational school, thus the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training opportunities are also well developed.
As measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
Despite practice training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineer graduates in recent years has decreased by one third.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences.
"We have encountered a number of reforms after the first pisa study," says a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government conducted country-wide comparison tests.
In order to start learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the benefits of the students improve sustainablely, future comparative studies will only be shown.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk schools decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other states.
The Bayers are better calculated.
And in the interests of the Saar countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise point.
For the language of neighbors is obligatory to gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks are almost different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez lets the timemes in the South American country return half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke.
According to the Official Journal of Venezuela, a new law sets clocks at world time minus four and a half hours.
So the South American State gets a time zone that is not in any other country of the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States of the world had imposed full-hour division in time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage affair.
The left nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not entertain any relations with the Head of State or to the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who proposes a constitutional reform which the citizens of the Altande have to vote on Sunday at a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had criticized Venezuela on Sunday with his decision "in his face" criticized Chávez.
Chávez is also in all mouths in Spain.
A new phone ring ton in the country provides birds: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who at the latest Ibero-American summit was generous of the constant intercluding calls of the left-populist and had driven this over the mouth.
German threatens wage minus 2007
Despite the strong economic recovery, German workers are threatened to lose real wages this year.
Experts called a whole set of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees in 2007 could actually expect less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"There is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price sharing of food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomy and economic research of the "image" stage.
New burdens could also result in unemployment insurance on workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent in the year change is correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, if the Federal Agency for Labour should not be embarrassed to ask for loans or grants, the SPD policy has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it was known that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has driven the inflation rate at the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the heroic twin of the earth
Despite its life-violent atmosphere of the earth, the Venus has been more similar than ever thought: the European space sun "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbines on the Poland, as they also occur in the winter on earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists suspect that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European Son "Venus Express" has proved - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on the Venus shoots at a height of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Natur".
According to the famous "Ursuppen Theory", lightning has caused life to develop on earth: Thunders are supposed to have stimulated responses in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there was life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon by the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today there is little living on the surface of the Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times thicker than on earth, sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil-willingness of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has struck such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties, no sin has been on the way to research this planet.
The latest research results now presented in several "Natural" articles, according to the researchers, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonities of our neighbouring planet with the earth are larger than initially accepted," the Esa informs.
Thus, alongside the already known spinal wind on the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud thruster on the southern pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a research team about Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The two-mindest planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet called morning star also cries around the sun in nearly 225 days.
But he's turning much slower around himself: one Venus day lasts 243 earthdays.
Although the Venus with 460 degrees Celsius surface temperatures and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both, waters were collected that remained on the earth in the oceans, but Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide on earth is fixed in carbon stones, it is the most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Kühler defends Merkels meetings with the Dalai Lama
President Köhler calls for an end to the party dispute about the receipt of Dalai Lama at the Office of Cancer.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for her attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
President Horst Köhler is concerned about the prestige of Germany and has invited the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this issue," said Köhler on the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the variability of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but Merkel took protection from the allegiance of claims, and she operates a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken away from the traditional one-China policy.
This also knows China," said Kölner.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly demonstrated discouragement over the reception of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier had inter alia complained about the Union's window policy in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lamas received at the Kanzleramt, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries, according to the information of SPIEGEL.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that Dalai Lamas was received as a mistake.
China refuses when European politicians receive the religious leader of the Tibetan officially, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he attempts to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provincies today, from China.
Shüble warns about scratches like in France
Road struggles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schüble warns against scraps as in France.
All things must be done in order to prevent social dissatisfaction in Germany from being exposed to violence on the road, the Federal Minister called for.
Barrikaden burned, Randaliers shot at the police with scrotflies: After the severe youth cruels in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We need to be careful that social explosives are not also built up and exhausted in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person is dealing with the rapid change in social reality.
Alliance, countries and municipalities have already worked hard on reducing problems, said Schüble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islam Conference, the first success has already been shown."
However, it is too early for warning.
Shüble at the same time pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people have been in heavy street struggles with the police in the past nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
However, greater integration efforts by the Federal Government demanded the President of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawalls in France, Colat warned about "nachahming effects".
The situation in Germany is not as bright as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background below 25 years is "averagely high".
In particular, more training needs to be provided.
Colat stressed: "We have to give youths a perspective."
However, the Chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families takes place".
Many young people with a migration background did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat admonished: "But we still have to be careful."
It is necessary to give youths the "snap opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the meantime, it remained largely quiet in the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flooded over the area with shiny men.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning waste and cars.
Since the morning, an order of about 1,000 security forces has provided rest.
The police will intervene as long as it is necessary, Secretary-in-Office Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
In the night on Tuesday, Krawalls in Villiers-le-Bel had been hurt about 80 policemen.
In the following night, the disturbances took over Toulouse.
The Krawalls were infected in a traffic accident where two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the public prosecution, the police are not blamed for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Cloud
The reality-distance of the Chancellor documents that the coalition is contently at the end - and that it is no longer expected of herself.
In which country does this federal Chancellor actually live?
After their disastrous appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, who was rude and poor of content, you must say: not here - not in the country that would finally have to be ruled by her.
The contemplation that she focuses too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an angry sentence.
It was provincial, she said, and she first showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics are about.
On the Bundestag, it has documented for all to be recognized how much their contemplation is true.
There was no specific interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a defeated politician who flies into foreign politics and remains nearly there.
Example of climate protection: It is unbremsed for the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
Overall, the self-loof - so much insignificance would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she climbs to the bottles that the rehearsal is coming to the people.
So she damages her image as a pragmaticist who solves the problems instead of talking the world beautifully.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a peripheral appearance.
Children's poverty and the concerns of the low-deserved?
It's got a few additional sets left for it.
It is noteworthy how often she promises when it comes to child beating.
Three calls need Merkel to get out a half-way straight sentence.
It's jumping like on a foreign territory when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacke
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney provide a tough exchange - and now have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already come out in the first topic.
He made New York a "refuge place for illegal immigrants" in Mid Romney, casting his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
He argues with serious allegations: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegals," against Giuliani, proposing the former governor of Massachusetts to have occupied private immigrants without paper.
The candidates blow to attack: Because the Republican base continues to have no clear favorites, the eight presidents use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The 30-security videos that Internet users have sent via YouTube are hardly more than the keyword providers.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain proposes his contradictor Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets strongly read by the Vietnamese Veteran when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", an interrogation method that simulates drinking as torture.
However, that the most important topics of the campaign are now beyond Iraq War and torture debates, the reactions of the hall public in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the Auditorium is on fire.
This shows once more where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I was mistaken at that time," explains Romney crushing and making on the basis and television audiences for praying that he was still part of the abortion advocates in 1994.
On the other hand, Giuliani comes into slinger when he is thought to be asked for a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilianity
One day after his retirement as army chief, the Pakistanian ruler Musharraf was defeated as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been devoted on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistanian television transmitted the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the benefit of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had surrendered his office as army officer to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus, especially from the United States, international pressure.
Eight years after his power capture in an unbloomed military putch, the former General is now for the first time ruled as civic Head of State.
Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand for opposition and the west with his withdrawal as commander of the army.
Another central demand is an end to the exception which Musharraf had arisen on 3 November.
As soon as he defends Musharraf, according to General Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will withdraw the exceptional state and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the State, which had occupied Musharraf after the suspension of the exemption at the beginning of November, had rejected all objections against the controversial election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In addition, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribe region of Northern Asia in an attack on a military convoy and four more injured.
According to an army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herb rock return
Germany's super group of seventy-seven musicians again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles up again at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival shows a medal from their great time "Live 1974".
Already at that time they were far more famous abroad.
The admirable sensation then occurs in the shape of three set gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front, his cable, and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thrones in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years young and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the Auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is focused on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band re-musicates Harmonia has provided some excitement among herb-rock lovers.
What can be revealed here: targeted demands revealed that the name, although the collective pop memory was awkward, did not in any way so sustainably to miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially what is called misleading herb rock, in England and America was always more valid than in their own country.
When the music economy gave the echo prize for the life work to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003, they saw in questioning German pop faces in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers still thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New! in the Laudatio, the admiration could not be limited.
At concerts, Michael Rother later caught the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignore at home and the Verklärung in the stranger is one.
The memory has already been exaggerated with Harmonia because the Trio existed only two years and also developed a much less effective power than they were assigned afterwards by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already musiced with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name Cluster.
First, they played in the basement under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label under the church.
Redher had shortly helped at power stations and then became a guitarist at New!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time, a reputation.
At 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Ancient Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city-flying Communists.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to suffer as a child girl.
It's rather in an artificial fashion.
It is claimed that in the block was also a wrinkle of the Harmonia Ottenstein Song Association and was a name for the art.
Some held Harmonia on it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so left and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material need.
The rice collection served not only for self-finding.
The now published CD "Live 1974" was cut into a concert in Griesem, in front of a nearly 50-headed record scene, as somebody thinks.
From Rother came the desire to force Harmonia and sometimes practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Redher landed in Esoterian spheres and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster has been revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than it was Harmonia.
The Griessemer Live Album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its plate company Greenland has aimed at maintaining the crude rock as its original German contribution to live music.
New! has already been buried like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Publicly subsidied, in the context of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, Old Punk and author of the Handbook "Crautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
The whole bandwidth of the influences of the herb rock would be rounded to the following pop music.
Harmonia is filled in the space of the supergroup.
The set of Brian Eno swoops with the most distinct sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the farming room.
The legend forming serves projections of other black-white photos of wire-cable devices.
Before that, the three veterans have been reconsidered about improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the handle to unlock unheard sounds to the instruments through self-made power devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technically deepened Tufter.
There is no change in the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morning Stars, sound clouds are hedged and whispered and sung at a beautiful place with Emphase "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were searched less in the blues than in music high schools (can), technology (kraftwork) or on the escape from artificial and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not able to get out of it even now.
The most obvious is still thoroughly covered on the stage.
Where begins music and when does it stop?
This can cause you to rob the nerves or escape moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Modern Peace" are discussing two films with the Balkan war again.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on Action and Geballer or they are too pleasant.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark backland of the Bosnia War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had lost the most beautiful man in the eighty years last, because too many nice and unimportant roles in well-feeling films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism drew out the desire to look forward.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter is being hunted" (Why really must movie titles always be as long today and we are like Lokführer Tarif contracts?) perhaps.
He delivers a marvelous picture of the eye: His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what could have become of Gere if the fate and the film industry would not be so gratifying: A man who has long been behind his best times, but who, even as a ruin-like monument of his decline, has preserved considerable remains of the unique charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" collaborates with the German production "Mortal Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Morderic Peace" you can make a short process: the film is dealt with by two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a serbian from cosovarian heck shooters, and one is also in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once represented as the sole root of all evils, the remote film is lost too quickly in Geballer and Action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without a motorway but with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be examined exemplaryly, why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are opening up to detect the Serbian chief war criminal "the Fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another turnbook author (both in the Staff Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are very shocking: Both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it becomes a trip to the madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't simply let Simon Hunt be the downcoming cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script has to face him with a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnier.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" will go down the bach when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time-raffing process succeed what Nato, CIA and all the world's head-paid hunters have not done in five years: catch the war crimers and leave the Muslim Bosnians to righteous vengeance.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in the Hague for crimes against the Kinology.
The film has a deepest human concern.
He wants to claim that Karadzic and Mladic are still running free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they should be exceptionally agreed) not to exercise persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good common and evil are sometimes so similar that a familiar Brecht poem comes in mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's working table: "I see the swollen stirrs, insisting: how hard it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swellheads, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraq's films were Hollywood's major floods.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star runs around on the crisis flocks or mining fields of the world, then it comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "over all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All the conflicts may be too close at times.
It had to pass decades before Hollywood with "Schindler's List" could turn a good movie about the Holocaust.
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works now known as classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces at the time.
But maybe we know today where every mass murder in real time comes home on equally two monitors, too simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the rotary writers the uncertainty it needs to tell good stories.
"Shine or nonsense" or "The Great dictator" have eventually become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically distant artist view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about parallels between his historic novel "Lemprière's dictionary" and the Balkan War, he answered: "This is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way and always war will rule in Yugoslavia."
Harvested by Beust Criticism for Olympia Cancellation
The abstention of the mayor from the application of Hamburg for the Olympic Summer Games has been strong criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Beust realism admonishes when assessing the chances.
The principal business leader of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared an absence on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project has developed as great motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
"Without this objective, sporting policy will not be able to maintain at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "the result of a changed timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in previous statements that the Olympic Ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least by 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an olympic application, but the German Olympic Sportsbond," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportsbund on an application of Munich for the 2018 Winter Games expected for early December.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the so far-woven period until 2028."
Yet, the dream wasn't cleaned out for all time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regreted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build a chance by buriing the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Plotz on Wednesday.
An absence of the application is also contrary to the statement of the Senate Head at the time of a receipt of the General German High School Association.
There Beust called Hamburg's application for the university 2015 "not a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD Citizenship fraction proposed to the Senate not to have used valuable time for the housing building in Hamburg.
"The development of the little Grasbrooks has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map of Olympia and tailored the apartment building," said the SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD always demanded an integrated planning for the small Grasbrook and a later living use, the CDU has set on the "Event factor" unilateral.
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games had provoked a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed to Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
Who connects the terms of Sweden and the wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, in Sweden, traded wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the four and ninety Brillo boxes of the "Type of Stockholm" listed there are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expresse" a few months ago doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research in the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now come to an encouraging result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made the Moderna Museum as a donation in 1995, are copies - and probably also the majority of the about hundred other Brillo boxes of "Type Stockholm" that are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is scarce, a confusing confounding of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his work in the Moderna Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made hundreds of Brillo boxes from Pappe: these were not from Warhol (for cost reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not artworks, it was their models, just exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted in 1968 the permission to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not issued in the Modern Museum.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then authorized as original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" rightly entered in the art and auction history.
Some of them have achieved over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed it had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968 about a hundred wooden boxes that Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had been dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, Chef Conservator at Moderna Museum, has also examined three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press plates were first founded and smuggled down, then white oil with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of copies from 1990 shows that the color with a painter roll without foundation was placed directly on the press plate - and it is not oil but acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition materials."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced to check the "hard accusations" raised in matters of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, it has been indefinitely silenced there.
