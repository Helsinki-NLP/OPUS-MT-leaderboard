28-year-old Koch in San Francisco Mall to be found
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The brother of the victim said that he could imagine no one who would want to hurt him, "At last he went up again."
The body found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the court medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a cook in Boston, had performed his dream job as a cook at Sons & daughters' restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A speaker of the Son & daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a tight family and we're going to miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a friend," Louis Garcia informed KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting to his family was to always cook us something to prepare for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swammed with the power.
"In everything that went wrong in the world, he was this unsleeved diamond, which shined bright every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case shall be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston does not always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview now.
"I'll always be put in drawers or get up from outside labels that mostly have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself don't want to always be perfect and successful."
"Finally, these things are rather screwed to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about her being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, forming television with loose dust and mexican food, says in the magazine.
To the white glow she brings the question of the child's desire: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," said the Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is to be seen as a single parent of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a trip on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-olds.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, hunting home to the feeders in the fast galopp.
One kilometer at this speed, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victory - was again near horses.
He was able to lead himself with his family over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he wasn't even pregnant for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was very convincing.
The German sports aid delivered the golden sports pyramid to the man from home in the context of a small Gala.
Awards do not lack the sympathetic athlete.
Federal Service Cross, Silbernes Lobbeerblatt, Champions-Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has adorned him.
Longer is the 18th prizeholder of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prizemaker Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means very much to me," says Langer, "for it will be forgiven not only for sports success but also for social engagement."
For decades longer has promoted the growing population.
And so he also passed the price money of 25.000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master winner was included in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the excellent athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fighters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruder Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fourer Meinhard Taker, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schokockemühle and posthum of the handballer Erhard Wonderful.
Many of these athletes had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US Presidency candidates are united in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claims Trump.
He will reverse regulations massively, and he will make himself strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The State has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money for it.
That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both of them are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
In those must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost at the same time.
The democratic candidate announces even the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical tea party flues.
Thus, on Trump there could still be participatory discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-drive coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, which he wants to terminate the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demands: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, does not want to sign both of them.
At the same time, both of us do not want to isolate the USA from international trade - but just better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, for example Clinton.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says that the minimum wage must be raised, then he says that it may not be changed.
However, the great discussion in the next few months is probably more likely to evolve around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to discharge the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.
His critics predict him that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution.
Refuge: "Every refugee woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that's up to a year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks with great eyes curiously into the room.
His mother stared on the table plate.
Until she notices she's being observed.
She smiles shortly and kisses the little one.
The scene works normally.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is area business leader of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bayern, and inter alia deals with the subject of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-frommed women and their children in Bayern.
In January Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munchner Women's Assistance.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not exaggerated to say: Every woman who arrives here has made experiences of sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Mans flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hopekeepers to Europe," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are: "Many are stealing from it secretly because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsory sea, honour murders, slavery or compulsory prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's going on on the run.
"The sleepper, for example, demands sexual action for a bottle of water, is not a rare thing," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, wrong, says Bahr.
Even here, lonely women in refugee accommodations are often considered to be low-quality and are worst abuses.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized.
"Some of the children have not been voluntarily created."
Many women would be so used to say nothing.
"Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often do not know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, demands Bahr.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their field of competence, some answered with no.
For example, there is not such a thing in the upper stake and high-ranks in government housing.
Also in Schwaben alone, refugee women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In upper bayers, under- and medium-franks, there are floors or homes in some Community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be placed separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are separately hosted."
"If the privacy fails or if men and women are stayed together, it can come to - persistent - violence against women."
Especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen at the Andrang, which is available on the house in Munich.
"Since we have spoken about that we are there, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistance physicians strike: demands for new labour fighting measures
Deputy representatives of the assistant doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new labour fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Juneor Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire Council to approve more work fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it would have deprived Ministers to deal with the concerns relating to the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter, the Chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained "protectly quiet" to problems, resulting in the rejection of the Treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC has voted in favour of completely rejecting the proposed new Treaty and called for official negotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has made a formal request for a specific meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating labour fighting measures that start early September.
The disputes led to the six strikes of assistant doctors this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana retreated after the choice to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the Treaty should be be beneficial and acceptable.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the Treaty for physicians in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Outsides?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and declare an official end of the war of words and economic sanctions for eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handwrap, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed slim, and he barely shined out warmth even for his restraints.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as if something bad had never happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighting aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was injured.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling in Russia.
The decade was even greater, as it was committed by a suspected friend.
Rebuilding vetrue will be difficult if not even become impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of executive officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He was controversy with this fever.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a gun stop are clear.
Erdogan needs mostly all friends he can get after he was removed last month in a failure of his office.
Repeated terror attacks on Turkey also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel organisers and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are restarted.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, public television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were restored.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes along this way."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted power acquisition as a weak answer.
This includes the persistent grief over the rate of tightness of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is aimed at benefiting from the cool mood and reducing Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian Head of State won with certainty a bonus in Ankara for requesting support for the chosen government bodies after the attempted state strike.
This is well noticed for Moscow a self-evidentness, which has a deep-seated fear of changing regimes.
The summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one of the ones I once described by an analytist, to represent "alliance of outsiders": two countries who are violating from the West and feel badly treated and now bonding.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support mutual sides.
It could be noteworthy that after almost three hours of first talk, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even discussed the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about its differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member of Turkey shot the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak with each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the Head of Board of Directors of the Bank, the brand RBS should only be reduced to a backoffice roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has been distant since then when it had to be almost collapseed and saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand streets "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial marks.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Victor Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange notation will be switched to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He informed the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will be our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local objectives.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop into the bank of brands, because how are we focusing inside (we have asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the Head of Board.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettor achieves its 3,000th win at Newmarket at Predilection
Dettor sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
The Jockey Frankie Dettor secured his 3,000th British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He set on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local racing route with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, reaching the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettor, who won on Ghayyar before it, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am lightened and very modest.
Dettor takes up the joy when he gets the victory at Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-year-old victory Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derbysieger had 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma enthusiasm for many years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that if he wasn't just a weekend and big tower jockey, he had already earned 6,000 wins!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but furthermore he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Detori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettor has been the dependent sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of major tower wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in 1996 in Ascot, but he also survived an aeroplane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six-month block, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defeat his two-floors and return to his best shape.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettor has once said that he wants to continue in competition until his at least 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fires Stabschef Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, unfortunately released his Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest confidence circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed the Special Agent for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kreml, Putin has ordered "the release of Ivanov's duties as chairman of the Russian Presidial Administration" without any reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's alternate representative since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, graduated from the renowned Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it says (in Russian) that he was later the Head of Protocol and Stabs Manager of the government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Staff Chief resigned to his own wish.
But despite the smile for the camera, only a few of them are convinced here - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as potential president - wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - was a great skepticism.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated post - you could almost say - troubled posts for four years.
As it appears, I have been chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his alternate representative.
When Putin reached power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he was most familiar with.
Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third term of office of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another alliance of Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute in the Los Angeles series last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its announcement in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcement.
On the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details about how the character of Gibson from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are written out, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios is expected to be published at a later date.
The 54-year-old previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first staple of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years," said Gibson in a release published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth staircase is held on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landed in garden in Banff
A inhabitant of Banff asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandales that were sprayed out by a spring well.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blasts" that approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scarlets.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed until May 2017.
Minister of Economics Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a really epical measure in this project with more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge roof is a warm activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the adaptation.
Altogether, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first lock is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
For this fantastic project, the locking is futurely high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road cover and its connection to the North Tower Deck in the expansion, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or countryside.
This was achieved by dragging the northern bridges 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very hot activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighed about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at an increase of about 3%.
Hekel, as the tolerances on which the team worked were small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "happiness to be alive"
Three men have "happiness to be alive" after they were thrown from their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming in safety, while their boat continued by their own strength.
"We saw the boat turning around and imagining the worst," said the leader of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have waved the boat out of their reach until we left water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and invented on a Boje hanging without rescue west.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have uninjured and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it was released from the person who controlled the boat at the time of the boat.
Someone's watched over these men today.
Heavily wounded - a man lays on his ex-friend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously hurts.
As the police told yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized actors cut the clothing of his ex-friend.
When this one came into the apartment, he stepped in on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police were able to arrest the killer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-friend's clothing, he called his mother.
She then alarmed his sister.
Together with her lifemate, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her lifemate.
On the street they met the man's ex-life friend.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old moved his sister side by side and attacked his ex-wife.
Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens believe that investors will be taken much more into account in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes for the next Council meeting a "residency concept of action".
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who is actually supposed to build the favourable apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD-Fraction Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also occur in stock.
But the big issue in the Council House is, says Bratmann, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent in such areas, but as much as 20 per cent of homes as social homes."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The left wants to be hard for investors.
Despite the fact that Bratmann said, the situation was worsened in the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff are needed.
It's unclear whether we'll get the experts.
However, the programme is not complete, for the about 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, however, is the loss of other about 1300 favourable apartments whose promotion will expire in the next few years?
It will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm, outgoing links should now be purchased by the city.
Moreover, it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price commitment.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved on a strike.
For in the West city, deadlines are expired at the end of the year.
Approximately 1800 apartments could be returned to the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners do not want to do that, the housing companies.
Because the number of social homes in the western city is again drasticly increased, the aim of the so-called mixture is to be disappeared.
There should no longer be a concentration of social weaknesses in a few urban areas.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU has to go to boat."
It has concentrated on more building sites for single family houses.
What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a pursuit of health and happiness worth it
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children are not going out to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was at first on the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the outdoor do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a drawing series, playcards and other spin-offs).
As many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early July.
The introduction of the market in other countries was suspended by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
In few days Pokémon Go had more users than tinders and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "fotografed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "catched" as soon as they were found.
A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wreck and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "mean" person leaves back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increase in performance.
Many public education campaigns for health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time", "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" came on deaf ears because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Regular sports reduces the chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to indicate it here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - motion, fresh air and sunlight and fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are murious play-destructors who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's up?
There was a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps such as fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game.
The new will lose its excitement and the use will delay in time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activeness in the real world and will help many people on hunting to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the Damenturn
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Unfortunately on the bar.
It's breathtaking on the ground.
That's brilliant.
And now, finally, Olympia.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament climbed to the multifight title and increased the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and Final Five companion Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafana.
The Americans Simone Biles turn on the sweeping bar during the single fight fine of women in the art towers at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fighting title and a total of the fifth, while fixing her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was ended at this moment.
This success puts her into the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated the last three years her sports, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the olympic agent of 1984 said Mary Lou Retton of her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
It expected her a final examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but between her and a burden of over-dimensional expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be regarded as disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after they won gold and silver in the single-made game of women in the art towers at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the divorce celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi who retired.
Although Biles insisted on it, while its long way to the top, never have planned the future, this is not really true.
A part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tumble passport - is coordinated to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by Trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tour hall, was trained in Bourman.
She has no longer lost a multi-fighting competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will last as long as it wants Biles.
Even though Mustafana was easily guided by two rotations, the image was deceived.
Sweeping bars and floor towers - in which cars hold the world champion's title - were watched.
She recovered with 15,433 on the sweep bar - and put another one on the ground with a 15,933.
Raisman gently embraced her when they expected her end-section - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliners, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake to Mustafana.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called the Americans "Amma", had a forespring.
After her soil exercise, she was thrown to the audience kissing hands, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in series murders shot in the car when listening to music
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot who had died in one of the most fatal attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix while they were talking in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a entrance, the authorities said.
The killer fired eight shots from a handfire gun, while standing on the car's bike side and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police informed that the threefold murder was not the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting led the detectives to become a closer look at whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
All in all, seven people were killed mainly in Hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks and two more injured.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard to the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nissance from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The detectives refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of their injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on the ground.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pick-up truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the series killer.
Detectives found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the few of his older companions, Edmund Microzephalie has the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can't do that.
I can't do this.
I didn't agree with that.
What's not at all wrong -- of course you've joined it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people still do,' Picciuto explained.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund couldn't sit or crack until his third year of life and he can't even speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can run with support and bicycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund's thought for "Please sing me something"."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephalia has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as massages or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
The symptoms and forecasts may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the prognosis for a long time because I don't expect it to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It'll be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives cause for salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the distress on Friday. It is expected the whole Saturday over with more rainfall.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of Mississippis flooded over their beaches and threatened with massive floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and have already been on the way to help the communities concerned.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the governor, informed that the demands for high-water vessels, boats and sand sacks were increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A flood warning system is used over large parts of the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall on rain.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood-feed warning system was used on Friday, while it continued raining in the Mobile area.
The river comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will be probable after the weekend record level.
Metreologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood over many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stream downward flood in Ascension Parish is a danger as they will only flow slowly into the Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever recorded on Friday at 9:00 p.m.
Rescue teams still flooded people from the river into the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives near him would have warned him.
"We have awakened and the water flowed and flowed in," said Hansford.
It reached my braille.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said he and his family had all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they had stayed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "promptly spread" because there was still severe rainfall and that the authorities would hesitate to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches rain.
Krutmann said that the ground had been significantly swallowed through the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and education failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a companion in Tangipehoa indicated 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, which were now overflowed.
The ruler of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets washed by the river.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed because of the flood and sand sacks provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison County said that it was still raining on the golf coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but no one has been reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "throughholed by balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week the second time a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents argued that Brown had several shot injuries, including lending, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his small body was hollowed by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez informed the transmitter.
I just can't believe this.
The condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family informed the transmitter that he is expected to be recovered.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Similarly, three men were shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical state; the other two victims are in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found in the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old who is in a critical state, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were just finding out if they could be among one of the wounded men of the criminals.
Investigators informed CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to be a cross fire between several shooters.
Cartridges for storm guns, which were traced back to various storm guns, overlooked the crime scene.
It seems that this was clearly a constant fight.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were shields.
Thus, there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved," told Police Hutpmann Anthony Ginaldi the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently reviewing reports according to the monitoring video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-slasher on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She's recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presenting under the women's olympia team in the tour and that for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984 I have been with every summer olympic and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew, and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one under the female tournament was an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympia winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she delivered unexpected but masterly gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won at an individual multi-fighting event for women gold.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but that's not how tour classes look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will only have four tournaments in the team, and this is last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks so that tournaments are a expensive sport and tournaments are mainly in private touring associations that will be maintained by parents, which will be used for training, installation, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families). The list can continue anyway.
The majority of these turning associations are in wealthy premises that can support the business.
In these associations the tournaments receive their whole training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started turning.
We need to enable the municipality a lot of young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to get a more lazy and easy-to-accessible tour training.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tour in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victories.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer youth a high quality tour that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for health and for educational and professional success.
It's the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in turning and that's great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thanks, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association's functionaries, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a election rejected it.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to compulsoryly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "none country" and any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend work in order to improve care for younger hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Assistant Committee, informed last night in a communication: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it will heal the current employment crisis and not treat all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time expires.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes by discussions were against the government's will and sometimes on ear-destructive silences.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month about that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, abolish the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to take further work fights.
The last strike at the end of April provided a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, since nurses and doctors were included to provide doctors on the strike line chain.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute on the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors under the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbeits struggle measures do not reach any of the only few, but already stressed teams and service providers and provide patients, caregivers and their families with only concerns, distress and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded to the concerns relating to the premium and the whistleblowing to the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from an occupational time, training, mutual recognition of the education plan, educational leaves and gender-specific rewards in the medicine - were a sign of the seriousness of employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health as regards compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after the authorities recommended that more people be given for a longer period.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a four-year dose to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffers another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiac infarctions and strokes are caused by collections of fat materials in the arteries walls that form locations.
If the coating breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot is dissolved, it can flow through the blood stream and block the blood flow to the brain, which causes a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.
The NICE guide draft today recommends a 12-month dose of 90 mg ticagrelor, followed by 60 mg with a twice daily use of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disaster consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on the quality of a person’s life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the haemorrhage - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes election fraud in Muslim areas flourish
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on initiation of a government report for corruption from the office
A culture of political correction has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, is prompting the police, electoral observers and council houses to ignore proof of election abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anticorruption king, said that the intimidation of choosers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up strips outside electoral cabins to protect feared voters.
He recommends that choosers carry a ID to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter must simply call his name and address.
The report suggests that a person's finger is not removable ink when he votes in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to Community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against electoral fraud, but is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture, which is associated with it," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Torn Hamlets electionscandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman, after a Lithuania, should be deprived of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had put his critics to silence with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said that "his campaign was based on the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a simulation where one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
In particular, he expressed alarmingly about fraudulent letter elections - in the elderly members of the Muslim Community pressure on people to choose a candidate for their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the guide of evidence to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence that pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh background.
"There was concerns that... government institutions had deliberately ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivitys regarding ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric delivered 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter selection documents to stop "choosing".
The report considered by Theresa May also requires harder registration reviews to prevent the use of the Electoral Directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask choosers for your ID before the choice.
Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as it has delivered its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are elected.
A three-year limitation on requests for automatic letter choice.
Prohibiting political activists to edit complete letter choices and envelopes of letter choices.
The police have the power to set up locks for election stations.
A change in law which facilitates an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the General Representation of the People Act 1983.
Photograph ban in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensive training to ensure that employees apply the rule that choosers go to the electoral cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "wonderful" that after the Tower Hamlet case, no penalty was given.
"The election court declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate representative for corrupt and illegal practices due to Lithuania," he said.
It was declared guilty for a number of reasons for adequate - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings -.
It also criticizes the ineffective "defect controls" of the election registration departments of Council Houses.
Sir Eric said: "The court judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country as the mother of Parliament has a proud heritage, but the alarming and concealing spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's Wheeler double walker and other famous double walkers of Olympia sportsmen in Rio
Fans of the Olympiade 2016 in Rio have been advised this week about the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot outside the edge and band, who has proved to be an impressive double-going woman of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is far from the only athlete that fights for gold, who has his own famous double walker - at least not if you have to believe in the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flipping on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood famouss.
The hunter and the wolf: Team member of the U.S. crew in the arch shoot Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's double walker on the bicycle railway, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bow shooter of the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. crew in the arch shoot Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter, after images that he looks unbelievably similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the archer got the madness into the social media and admitted that he has already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity myself, except for face hair," Brady informed the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm sure that's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take even more place in this year: the overall similarity between the British winner Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafana with her large, expressive eyes is supposed to be able to go through as a double-going woman for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
A walk higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actor
Another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun brown skin and blond hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans to be like a "atletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities
Theory placed in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which are almost identical to the one Laura Linney actress, as well as the gold medal winner in the tournament Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimming woman "as a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m Free Style Swimming Stamp, disturbed audiences of the CBC life transfer of the Olmypian games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "like Mief" and during the race as "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he delivered his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swimming stamp.
MacDonald, who had been taken on board at the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, departed like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming stake 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to open the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane twote, "Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimming woman from China "as a pig died"???
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on a mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming stake for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald came on Twitter quickly and hard, where many talked to him
Twitter-User didn't stop when they heard how insensible Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance was issued."
It was an unfortunately chosen formula, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologized at the end more than 90 times for the people who responded to the notice about Twitter
The commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and released a message.
We regret sincerely that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be rayed out.
Yesterday night, we apologized quickly for our audiences on sending and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Yet they were unpleasant and an unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for the mission and tried to justify his comment, saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I'd like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the female swimming stake in the CBC Olympic Sending, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry."
Buyers in Primark are angry with woman who trys in the middle of the business unshameless underwear
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underwear.
To worsen the situation, she mustered the way she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back into the shelf.
She stopped and tried four pairs of pants in a business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark shop in the Bouvery Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the subheads before she placed them back to the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she pulled herself back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of subheads from the exhibition, pulled out her own trunks and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a somewhat more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freaky like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the underheads that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back in the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other subheads before finally she decided that she didn't like anything, pulled herself back and went out.
"She did not seem to disturb that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underheads she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: "How absurd to think that someone would take subheads home who had another person and who were not washed."
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I got it, the employees tried to pull out the clothes after she left - which is as good as it was."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of subheads and find out that another woman had her and went out again and she wasn't washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, the 9th August in our department in Folkstone."
All products concerned have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself with Krav Maga from weapon attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a great champion of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers in close distance.
Regardless of whether you are approached from front or back, this video will show you how to turn the spit for your robbers.
If you are approached from the back, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.
Then beat him with the knee into the candle and turn around while the attacker crumbles up before pain, the gun out of his hands. Beat him with the run in the face and move backwards while they direct the gun on him.
In case of attackers approaching from the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the gun and rotate it, so that the attackers can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move backwards and direct the gun on him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it happens to Mizrachi.
But remember, it's safest for a robbery to spend your money - unless you're not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Travelers Ian Wright shed his tongue for a traveller at the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveler undercovered his immune system and the wormflex of a serious test - by laying down some of the dirtyst and most disgusting places in Europe.
The modernist and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, shook his train on a Euro-shine, a landing on the Piccadilly Circus, a washing button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will do.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the daylight.
The idea of licking off the washing button of a towel that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely absurd, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen wash.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of darm bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left behind what he sucked more than a bad aftersmak in his mouth.
Mr Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public landings at railway stations to wash buttons of toilets, the task made his immune system definitely under a sample
In the movie, he told: "Already as a child, I was relatively unaware of my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the movie, he was at all right with his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample stroke showed a luminometer of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick off after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "The worst thing I smelled in a toilet is close."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna look at anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company places Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of darm bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended with saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we could provide consumers with more information on this in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the board of the film, added: "Let me say it like this - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to make Ian look at them and others with which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty decorations into a movie."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all milk acid bacteria associated in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 percent stated that they use at least sometimes products containing accompanied milk acid bacteria.
Asian family destroyed before deloging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A Asian family left her social apartment after a delogy with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the apartment company found property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed climbing holes, wooden parts were crushed, waste was scattered on the floor and gravfiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been resided and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had caused included street fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of inhabitants, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, disputes and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an order for anti-social behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be cut off, old garbage was found
In the property in which drugs have been traded in the past, the wooden parts have been scattered
Neighbors said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be regularly called to the police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partner violently this week from the property after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The delogy was rejoiced by enlightened neighbors who said their life was made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we're telling the police here are incredible.
"Today we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not usual!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have deserved the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were regularly called, for 20 years
On the overwhelmed side of the municipality house was thrown down waste and old toys
He added:"It is a shame that the tenant deserved to accept any responsibility for her behavior and that of her family, since a delogy is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, since behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have courageously joined us and let us get the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and give the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that is left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delegation
Workers of the house management will now have to remove wastebergs that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as waves, paraphernalias and cash at £1,700.
Skeldon received a penalty sentence after she had declared guilty of possession of a drug of Class B for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say she will deleirate tenants who do not adhere to the regulation of the house
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police informed that the delogy was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not follow the house order.
"This is to those who think that they can behave without suicide and to those who have been injured by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deeply flying military jet over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force plane made an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but persisted in that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment in which scared tourists start to get panic after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew nearly in touchable vicinity over the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holidays jumped up when they understoodly began to worry about the noise of the dye drives, without first seeing what came through the clouds on them.
The event took place last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidays who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It really fled very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surving and it felt like the plane would fall down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were paniced when the plane came out of the darkness and flyed incredibly deep
The Portuguese air forces today argued that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats outside the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the bad visional conditions, the jet was flying somewhat deeper than usual, but the air forces persisted that safety was not at any time threatened.
Area burns have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today argued that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoking - which restricted his view.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to the first track win in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the duel around the Spanish supercup outside against the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner has to abstain from Neymar, with the underlying cuppinalist and ruling Europe-League Champion, who deals with Brazil with the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
The German suffered a tape douching in the knee in training, which clarifies the question of Barca at least in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been contesting for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique abandoned a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter stepen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new time, the Spanish master doubts about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated in a test game of Liverpool on Saturday with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the sample race against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince.
Sevilla, on the other hand, has the 2:3-degradation after renewal in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has hitherto been eleven successes by the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in its own league to Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis olympician.
The 27-year-old conquered Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.4,4) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one-sided finale.
Thus the World Range List first got the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at WM, World Cup, World Tour Final Tour and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have done it as expected in the end game and made up the titles among each other.
This was clear that for the third time in a sequence, a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the Upper Olympia Trip was the former SVS NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang had left themselves on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had retired to the tribulation and left their protectors alone in fair competition.
"The matches up here I've played for my country."
"I'm playing for myself at the final," said Zhang.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpected unilateral.
Mom had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang off there only 13 points in total.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected ripping match did not develop.
Nevertheless, there was enough breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The White Russian had inflicted a rip injury in its quarterfinal against the German European Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, then in medical treatment, had to satisfy "lastly" with Blech.
Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had also become in the same high table tennis age of Olympia.
Donald Trump clears ′′ huge problems′′ in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. republics is struggled with massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states.
The President's candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican Highburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the multimillionary that usually appears largely and self-safe expressed concerns, as correspondents reported.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within its own republic camp, now the doubts of his success in the fight for the White House grow.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Debt is false reports about his candidate, he again took up his famous media shirts.
Republican Highburgen wackeln
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June SurveyUSA survey, Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were equal.
Other institutes see Trump in front, but not with the distance used for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered at risk.
In an interview by the Sender CNBC, Trump answered the question how he wants to stop Clinton's foremarch again: "Genauso, as I have done so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation".
He does nothing but "to tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correction, please, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Party of Trump was supposed to have threatened to strike funds in support of its campaign, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, you would like to take the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress more closely.
Olympia: Trigger fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a discipline Commission in the case.
Kenia's light athletes are threatening after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed us to set up a discipline Commission immediately to examine the case.
A Kenyan functionary had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had delivered a urine test under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.
This has been reported by the doping controllers to the Kenias team.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC for information on the case to enforce its own investigations, an IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an evaluation," said in an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and issued himself as Ferguson Rotich, the sample issued and signed," explained Kenya's Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Light Athletic Head Michael Rotich had been distracted from the Rio Games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes from his country against money payments about ongoing doping tests.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been observing the IOC for a long time after many doping practices.
In an announcement of the more than 2000 Doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out in advance that special athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into vision.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create a anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start.
Following this, WADA Kenia took from the list of countries whose doping combatation is consistent with the WADA rules.
Kenya is regarded as a large runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most of the medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
A number of television reports of the ARD repeatedly accused that in Kenya Doping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian light athlete.
It was demonstrated that this type of sport was covered and systematically baptized.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of love, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquered Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and satisfied with the role of Maria a youth dream.
In the orchestra grave, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, directed by the Venezonal Dirigent Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swears.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an elderly Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with grief while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because she's musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and fun and bright."
So she is smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a very generous man.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Diriging is a necessity for him.
You see it in every movement, in your eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, passion, and also a happy approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly current: "In this piece it is about prejudice and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as significant today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, died according to reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the base of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she intended to leave the armed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going into a war area - prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands' confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader of Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dead Judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker of Reid later said that he hadn't even spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the nomination of Garlands, are Lakais and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was unfit for the Presidential Office.
Treats want naked calendars for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine cooperates with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970 Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
The manager of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his naked magazine differs from Oldschool Playboys, since "Playboy be for men".
I'm doing this for women.
He seems to think that the calendar does.
"We have to return to showing timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality counted with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed bags," says the Chairman of the Golden-Nearly Foundation of Dialog and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects, in the short term, tens of thousands of protectors who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "some hundred thousand", believes Ali Toprak, the chairman of the Association.
Due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the putch attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"Shortly, I count with tens of thousands, medium-term, with some hundreds of thousand people looking for protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already transferred Kurdish highburgs with criminal actions months ago, 500 000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run.
After the patch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the excursion pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been destroyed or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the Association called for the Federal Government to "position as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
In Germany a "hox hunt" against Erdogan critics also takes place.
I'm not feeling safe in Germany in the last few months for the first time.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks to abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposals.
The brand marking as a golden trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed bags, also the chemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Golden-Nearly Foundation of Dialogue and Education, the "World".
According to the newspaper calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Inner States, the Turks already presented the largest group of asylum rights recognised for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
At the end of June 30, these were 11.386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all asylum-oriented acquaintances (39.625).
In this survey there are no flights before war, poverty or perspectivelessness.
Asylum rights according to the basic law are exclusively political, i.e. by government, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The inhabitants do not get anything from the summer-walk fight with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021 the country day election will not take place again directly at the end of summer holidays, the Swiss Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not more foolish than so far: summer holidays, heat and country day elections - that bites.
The inhabitants to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most of the holidays that are in the country, on usedom, rumours or Hiddensee on the way are not local, so not to choose the land day.
This includes practical problems: In the holidays, helpers are hanging the plates, blowing up air balloons, distributing flyers, and counting out the voices, just trying to extinguish.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, the Mecklenburg prepommers have to pass nearly the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, just started.
And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
It is exciting how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition-oriented thing.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, is making a almost unreasonable electoral struggle, one looks away from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and plagues a little with the people, just as it did his legendary wortkarg predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet and cansler Merkel blamed the flower of AfD.
Their refugee policy, "We can do this" has speeded up the rise of the right-populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Inner Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make elections at the wrong time at the right place.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale environments twice; Merkel Federal Day elections are located in the northeast.
But the target group was wrong, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxony there as mecklenburgers and prepommers.
"There was probably the majority from other states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely abstains from the usual elections on markets and before shopping centres with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, like kokert says, just play a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you broke the base on the country, that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the wide parts of the country hardly available.
However, the CDU voter's Council of Kokert to his competitors is also self-explanatory: "You must go where it hurts, where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is at stake, selling has now called on its SPD to be a particularly engaged election campaign.
In surveys, social democrats were last with 22 per cent behind CDU (25) partners and only shortly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won clearly with 35.6 percent before CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should create the jump to the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the vacation note and place their election campaign largely on the Internet.
"Online-Wahlkampf", it calls the country chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electoral fighters are looking for local voters among the vacants.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is basking with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still enjoys it.
Their impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27 Sanification: Guest places suffer under locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is resettled, there is nothing to mecker.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20 a.m., there is all praise.
"They have made everything pretty sucky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet tank station.
It's a super team.
There's no delay.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half time, until the end of October is supposed to be done.
It is also commended that the responsibilities of the construction work, such as the establishment of assistance entrances.
Since the construction site was moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Asperg Street in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg has been relaxed.
Citizens are now able to re-explode from the B 27 by frequently.
The reimbursement traffic through the place seems to go back.
"There were partly considerable complaints," says Vice-President Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the rehabilitation.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sleeves were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than with the painting.
As a result, some trucks were scrutinized in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality called on the measuring vehicle from mossingen to be increased.
"There were considerable violations," says King, who once informed himself on the ground about the situation.
There have been two to three bleds per minute.
The fastest was on the way at 77 hours in the pace-30 zone.
Since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become more calm.
For businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small comfort that customers from Rottenburg are now open to the road again.
Looking in the maps can not be liked by businessmen.
But that the B 27 Sanification has led to sales breakdowns with them, lets everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "exploitant" are producing for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "most slightly decline", but also admits that of course "the run know-how is missing".
The locals are most insulted along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, the owner of the steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.
That's already a threat to the existence.
Not only he, but all the guest places hit it hard.
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The sales benefits are "over 50 per cent".
The road rehabilitation has thrown its operation back "about two years".
He had to release half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President-in-Office Jörg Schmidt has asked Göhner whether there may be a financial compensation, answered with the point that the guest place benefits from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that occur through the rehabilitation.
Gühner knows of other districts, where such a thing has been handled more generously.
At all complaints, Göhner is sure that his guest place will continue to exist.
Finally, the family operation has been established here since 1715, pointing to the long history.
He can understand the less frequent view of other tribal guests now because of the complex transportation.
If you can't go, it's nice somewhere else.
That his ancestor client will return after the end of the rehabilitation work, there is no doubt about it.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird grips, Göhner maintains the impact of the B 27-building work on his customer for the biggest crisis that has experienced his guest place in their long-term history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terrorism, laws are constantly screwed.
Following recent attacks, Minister-in-Office de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All his proposals are "politically acceptable to the coalition partner", says the Federal Minister of Inner Europe in the presentation of his new security package.
They're not exaggerating anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also take part in it.
As an internal minister, however, he was located at results and at a "reachable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has taken a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they are now far more expensive.
Some things are already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Neither the fact that Germany has to implement several EU data on passenger data and weapons law.
Similarly, the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising.
Partly, the Maizière starts a second start for proposals that have not yet been linked to the SPD: he wants to punish sympathetic heritage for terror groups and the Djihadists with double citizenship to get off the German passport.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
He still considers this to be acceptable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chances.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have it partly in itself: he plans quick procedures for disposal and more possibilities to imprison people before dismissal.
Refugees who are collected targeted into the country are to have their smartphones checked and publicised social media accounts for a security verification.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum candidates, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to hide their identity.
Some of them are political and legally ugly.
Some are still unfounded and leave questions open.
And in some points - for example, in the case of unequal treatment of patients - the question is, what does this really have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differ between the topics of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be said that the murderers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about security in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that were deeply occupied by the people were not able to get out in election times.
Internal security is hugely focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insecurity is great.
And yes, there are election fights.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly able to deal with internal security.
In the past days, there was a rise between the two parties.
Only a graceful dispute about the feasibility of the Federal Police, then about a security policy ideas collection of some Union ministers, in which the Ressort Chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a departure from the double citizenship.
The Maizière also strives to reconcile sounds.
He won't keep anything from a departure from the double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
You can reopen, don't be meaningful.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is really "to be reluctant" for the coalition partner, it must only appear.
There's a lot of things in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Head of the party, Sigmar Gabriel, signals carefully and says: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security."
People's cars are still passionate.
Despite Diesel scandals, the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But it is not in all markets.
In the call-back action, there is a spine for a term.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year at the deliveries.
Europe's largest automobile builder, despite its many brands and some well-running markets, can continue to present a plus in the past year, despite the Diesel affair.
However, in July the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the overall sale, as the company recorded in Dax.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles in July than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, according to China, the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany delivered almost a sixth.
Head of trade marks Jürgen Stackmann had the weaker figures from July resulted mainly in two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a restraining of purchases through "changed economic frameworks".
In addition to the situation around the Turkish putch trial, the UK voting has also stressed the withdrawal from the EU, explained a speaker.
In the United States, where the exhaust affair first escalated, there is also a minus on the book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
In any event, the principally affected house mark of the Lower Saxon is further glazed through the Diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a minus of 0.9 percent is booked to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to continue to sell from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered people's cars at this time, worldwide 5.904 million.
People's cars had manipulated with a software exhaust tests.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for rehabilitation to the workshops.
In the course of the rehabilitation, VW confirmed that the restructuring of the vehicles did not have any negative effects.
After the reconstruction of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car builder issues the customer a "garranty equal" certificate after rehabilitation, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal fees.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers a guarantee for rearsted diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting was held.
"The VW has to fulfil the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA in full."
"Directives are not accepted," stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that there are no deteriorations in the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after rehabilitation and that all type-approval-related vehicle values have unchanged stock.
People's cars themselves, however, do not use the term "guarantie", as it was called in business circles.
In the wide term "guarantie", Volkswagens see the possibility that, for example, customers come to a workshop for half a year after rehabilitation, for example, with a motor damage - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal is uncertain with regard to possible guarantee arrangements, as it said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "garranty".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands rich spares in future penalties - as a second institution in Germany.
On Thursday, Bank Manager Joseph Paul said: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or daily money accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and sees no signal in it: Normal Sparers "had not have to fear paying for their spare-gross penalty rates".
Storage Banks Money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty rate.
This fee requires the Rail iron bank Gmund from September from private customers and business customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Giro or daily money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros since some time, which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not use.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend for every million EUR 4000."
The costs are now given on the basis of the polluter principle.
It would be too dangerous to leave the cash money in the rackets of the rail iron bank: "I've already experienced four assaults, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of installation.
Only a few walked to other banks.
The Society of Bayern explained: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry it on its own for "containingly for the sake of business".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty rates for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its tax bank branches 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the principal business leader of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay surplus fees for deposits, so competition in Germany with banks and savings funds is much too strong."
A banker said that at Tegernsee there is "a client that is a little more luxurious of the assets".
"This can become a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money free.
The 1911 founded cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Society of Bayern "is currently not known any other banks that calculate a deposit replacement for deposits by private customers," said speaker Ernst.
The President of the German People's Banks and Rail iron Banks (BVR), Uwe Frühlich, said at the end of June: "The threshold to go into the negative to the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany will not fall in the width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Single men of middle age love records.
Before you hurry to comment part to oversee it under the pseudonym NotAll Single MenMedieval ages with raw injuries, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widely discussed resurrection of sound plates is not a tree in Millennials that welcomes the news of physical objects, but is due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a plate are all prospects from 45 to 54 years of age.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a hord by hobby gathering - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me, while I run in the middle of a business road in Soho, a modest grey suit wearing and stuck wild before I stay standing, holding my hands and saying something determining like, "So, let us throw a closer look on it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly resorts to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate special shops.
I'd probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in immediate proximity to various men in such businesses and try to evaluate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (Data Number: two young women, three men of middle age) to the reckless records (Data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, do I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snap shot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy discs that he could not afford when it appeared and again purchased items he sold when he was young and plunged.
"Many things I buy are from the late 1960s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meet meet the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media hpe, people who heard about the comeback and saw them buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people have usually disappeared around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.
Customers who once sold their records to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the followers of the plate revival of a particular age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that plate stores offer a resting community of equal-minded ones.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a hit on the contactless payment system.
Some album fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar plate sheets, from objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think it can sometimes be a filling of an empty or possession of material property as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's what I'm as a collector, and I think it's the way many people do.
It's a simple way to go spiritually.
"We're like their social workers!" A staffman flew out from a record pile.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet.
The survey also found that 41% had a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record did not have a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I blew through a bunch of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of middle age) has noted a "tropical aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound plate so that I can put it in the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it happens definitely.
More product-lasting, less music-lasting.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who devoted the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bright audience when I enter.
There are pairs around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and women of middle age.
Although the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex packed pop instead of experimental Jazz driven from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among the customers.
No one of them looks strangely lonely, but naked psychic traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the varieties of the plates for sale.
She's making a show window bumble rather than a big shopping.
It doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records is not a real option, she says.
It's a lot of money.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with an in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of album lovers must have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I make it seem to measuring the Jeans Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley plate player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just decorative, some are so far above that it's impossible to touch them.
It's just "plattenkunst".
But in view of the fact that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the sohos depths for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is not surprising that a population that has more time and money than others is the one that spends most for luxury items such as plates.
Although my research revealed that the results of YouGov were true, they, at least in record stores in Soho, let the large number of female collectors and album lovers that exist in reality, album businesses and online forums, be unaware.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with bumling through plates of the Berwick Street and leaves through plates, while they avoid the staring view of a stunning 30-year-old false moderner who rages no unusual men of middle age over the shoulders.
The Greenlandhai is the longest living spine animal - video report
Scientists say that the Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all the spinal animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examined the Haie, says that the record was a female who assumes that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects the offer on the disposal of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to deprive dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In the course of a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to break down 72 provisional transactions in which persons in the warehouse sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdryer services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be defeated because they would be a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and that would save a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the government-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the stock.
They also assumed that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for exposing people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely reflectable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the degradation was the jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in common and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, as well as a advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of protected, unattended minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kid's café.
In a letter to the Guardian it stated that the closing would be "for these children a disaster, of which the last eight years of age."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of lives in the jungle have increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a large increase in newcomers during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic Road, cycling professor Tony Martin does not want to be intercepted.
"I continue to keep the WM in mind, remain confident and fight on," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelveth place at the sugar hat.
"I'm honestly difficult to comment on yesterday's time travel," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to the Debakel.
At the time driving WM in Katar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This includes my position," wrote the three-time champion, who had lost on Wednesday on 54.5 km more than three minutes on the Olympiatic Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missed halffinale
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarterfinale of Rio: The World Range List-32. from Metzingen missed by 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the halffinale of the Olympic tennis tower.
Siegemund, which was suffered by back problems, could only spend one time and acted forceless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the Medal Hopning Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance to jump to the final round.
The Australian-Open winner met Britin Johanna Konta (nr. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had received a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTE-starters in the quarterfinale of summer games had last been in 1992.
Never had a German duo stood in an Olympic Single Halffinale.
Groups start up for live video game transfers
Looking at other people when playing video games is a giant center - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology company buys the start-up beam that specializes in this hobby.
As much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not inform us on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and counterfeit enemies and provide equipment.
The playerial Activity Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of the e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is intended to help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle in Washington, U.S. State, will move to Microsoft's headquarters in California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and Chef Matt Salsamendi informed.
For the customers, there is nothing to change by taking over.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch had been bought by the online dealer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser must set up to the next generation speed meters: in various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested, which are intended to transmit temporarily efficiently.
For example, the futurist-effective Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used at accidental difficulty where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no infrastructure needed to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flash there, for example, with motorway construction stations or to reconstruct bridges with a temporary tempo limit.
However, lasting mobile construction can be too dangerous or vigorous.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: its battery holds five days on uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data are transferred encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can be recorded over several traces simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as passing bans by time, drive strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
You can move the trailer in a high-speed state according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer coupling.
In order not to be stealed simply, it is lowered in the measurement operation, so the wheels in the panted and, by the way, also disappear of the shot-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015 the trailer has been tested and used in various federal countries according to Vitronic data.
Also foreign authorities flash with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in 7's Rugby after Fiji's master class got gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-Rugby came at the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last barrier in the form of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji delivered a master class in action, side stepping, backwards, line loops and rough force to win gold - their first olympia medal any color.
The defeat was rejoiced by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament, where they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in halffinale on the same day could fall on them at the final.
But regardless of that, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's Chief Trainer Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind itself.
They lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan eight years ago.
Here they lost only one.
This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs be ridiculous.
It felt like the Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With four minutes of play time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A magnificent tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it stopped only Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the reception and there was still over a minute playtime ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou proclaimed by another weak tackling of the GB team and stormed up to line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.
That's what it is.
GB made fundamental changes to half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been long in favour of the South Sea isolate, whose fans sang, swept flags and danced on the trib.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-top with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The pepper sounded, Fiji's embraced and GB kicked devastatingly hit into the grass.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a hard half-final match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late thanking by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer to rodersieg
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what you want to say.
From the first routing to the last, 220 hard hives that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were sitting on the rower, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of trainer Robin Williams, was widespread when they were going to the second Olympic Gold in the two without tax wives in sequence, the first women in the history of British sports, who laid such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, anyway, their 39th unattended operation, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of pigs, which does not reflect the type of triumph to go.
Behind each gold in the roar, a bataillon stands on willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference, and there was no one helper than the trainer who, 30 months ago, didn't know whether he would survive this day at all than it was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said he was risky.
I had bubble cancer, which is operational and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little changing the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption at a minimum, if that under such circumstances is at all the right concept.
I needed money, so soon I had to get better.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Roading on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even greater.
In the immediate victory, their first thoughts of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking more than anything else, trying to cope with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This might be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn't hold with.
Even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to loosen, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "be in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to be ridiculed.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for doing something great.
We did not want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a delay for one year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I'm an olympian.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years, an example of clarity
The director of the Water Purpose Association "Veietsteingruppen", Ruppert Göller, goes to retirement.
The association is deemed to be "exemplared throughout bayer".
A smaller freezing drinking water as an example for the large water producers.
That was what it said in the original sound a few years ago in a contribution from the Bayerian radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of underfranks deserved the purpose of the association.
The work of the Veitenstein Group considered "bayer-wide as exemplary".
Behind all of this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the purpose association, is 28 years as manager.
Now he was adopted at the age of 65.
The Drinkwater Group of the Veitenstein Group, located in Kottendorf, the municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and blades with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are the churches of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Broitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded Rupert Göller that in 1985, Rupert Göller was appointed as the manager of the Association of Purposes.
"Their tasks have been very diverse, and they have extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, the budgetary establishment, the calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the Chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the launch and dedication of the new sources (1994), land purchases in the field of new sources (1998) and the compensation for farmers, the recovery of the high containers (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the breakdown of water pipelines.
There has been no stop and there have been renewals, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has spent a lot of heart blood for his water-use association and he has lived the water-use association quite as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he had to present the success concept of the nitrate reduction group before the water forum of the district underwater.
He has received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller on his part praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water guard and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were an inconsistent team.
As peaks from his viewpoint, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipe break at the high container at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees will have to work throughout the night, so that the villages could be provided with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn has been maintained only once because you filled the high container from Pettstadt with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who is the successor of Rupert Göller.
Sopranistin Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed she had to die.
But now the eight-year-old Tiago has come forward well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that goes back two years when I sang at the mailer Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he's the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos' connection to the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Barghnesse - Man shoots on lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at Friday at 10:45 p.m. in a multi-family house in Barteheide (Crys Stormarn) and hurt her deadly.
"The man himself called us and indicated that he shot his lifemate," said a police speaker.
The perpetrator shall be on the run, and after him shall be caught publicly.
Meanwhile, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a glaze.
Now, the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
In the meantime, the man is wearing a glass.
I don't want to address the man directly.
He could still carry the gun, like the police.
If Sven S. sees, call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relation state".
The victim is the yeargang 1988, the killer 1981.
At first, the competent police in Lübeck did not want to provide information about the tatherpass or the relationship between the victims and the victims, but she confirmed that a man had been killed.
"It's a killing."
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special commission (SEK) was at the crime scene.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The German steel industry, which is in crisis and energy-intensive, remains spared from additional costs at millions of levels.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from eco-stream promotion are from the table.
It remains in exemption from the renewable energy environment for the so-called self-stream production plants in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Westdeutschen Allgemeinen Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the high oven to produce electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry, the steel industry threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to 240 million per year.
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Westager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC conversion of 20 per cent will fall.
But they are not also raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
In this way, the status Quo of the previous regulation is largely set up.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is particularly important.
"For our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"Further have to follow."
"In addition to the reform of emission rights trade, climate and employment objectives are to be considered," explained IG Metall Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation increased when the world's largest producer country China was thrown massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers propose Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, import duties due to imports of steel and on the other, economic prospects in China have increased.
Unclear is the sustainability of the price recovery.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Last time the prices would have been more stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closings of individual works at last.
In the German steel industry, about 86,000 people were busy at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
They produced by 3.4 million tons of more than six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association informed steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now went back the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production is about two percent below the previous year value.
The association is expected in the next few months, thanks to an improved order position with increasing emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Sing makes Seniors good
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school chore, in the school office study she worked in the music department, and today the 78-year-old singt in a senior choir.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and more alive, she says.
Besides, she does something good to her health and spirit.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorliga.
Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
Regular collaboration allows seniors to connect and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To meet and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of cohesion."
Sing can be hard in a positive sense, says Hackler.
For thereby seniors train a deep and controlled breath.
If you regularly demand your lungs, you don't even get out of the breath in your everyday life.
Even if it is about receiving the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On elderly people, sing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explained.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with the positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and particularly melodies, even demensed people are deprived of long-term events.
When singing, a special performance is also required for the head, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
A enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-quality also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I will be better and grow beyond me - strengthens this experience.
So there's good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes down there?
Looking for the suitable offer, seniors have various options, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circle sing in a senior chor, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the Chöre in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the church or the church leaders directly.
Many senior creatures are also found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.
Anyone who wants to sing should certainly join a choir, Hackler advises.
Sing the soul does good and has something relief - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cats to the screams of young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of the calling of cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauing did not let the males cold, but they always acted the same as the females.
Female cats can detect the excitement rate of cat babys at the miauen of the little ones.
They respond about ten percent faster to the sounds of cats who are in great distress, as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University Hannover (MHH) discovered.
Cater also responds to the call of kittens - but always the same.
"Evidently, the acoustic differences between the miauing of smaller and strongly occupied young animals for the males are either not perceiveable or not important," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology magazine.
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and tone height of the kitten cry differ with the urgent need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the MHH animal maintenance.
They were pretended to be a call of little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mothers and siblings.
Secondly, they were confronted with screams of more resistant cats, which were additionally raised.
In spite of the small sample, researchers consider their results meaningful.
"All females, even those who had not yet had their own reproductions, responded differentiated to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned faster to speaker when this call played the very more reliable kitten.
This ability may be congenital or develop with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past scientists have already several times in humans examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reports biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski takes with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sukur is a football league in Turkey.
In Turkey a warrant has been adopted against the unique football star Hakan Sukur.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the pussy, a major football game will be held again in Turkey.
Before the duel of the erzrivals between Vistas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is indicated.
Already when the exemption was suspended after the retrospective attempt in July, the government held that the daily life of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah golden, who is responsible for the pussy.
It does not stop before the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükyr, the prosecutor issued a arrest order.
Thus, the Southern Southern, which is now living in America, is being condemned to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sukur is supposed to be the attendant of Preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the putch test by State President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exceptional state, firstly for 90 days, still applies until October, it actually has almost no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The night's "democracy wakes" on public places throughout the country, Erdogan declared an end on Wednesday.
Sports is - like the whole country - divided into attendants and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the worker club Vissiktas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
However, in view of dramatic experiences in history, the strict rejection of military pumps is what the Turks are doing.
There even the fans agree - no matter whether their hearts beat for Galatasaray or viewas.
At Pokalsieger "Gala" it will come to Lukas Podolski again.
His sports value proved to the Cologne in the past season: with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fantics" rejoiced him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion found a reconciliable conclusion.
After the Vorrunden-K.o in the Champions League, the "Lews" also disappeared early in the Europe League.
In the Super Lig it only reached Rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pokal was the only way to win something.
"We did that, and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Viewas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who lay the base on the 14th title with 26 season matches as Süper-Lig Torschützenkönig.
This is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In this respect, the Gomez, who was only borrowed at the AC Florence, had announced that he was not returning after his EM leave because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just needs to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
However, the storm must be willing to abstain from about a third of its estimated 7,5 million euros, Orman stated: "We can't pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice because of dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa cannot start in Rio.
Other transmitted light athletic singers can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The topic of Doping continues to determine the headers of the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had accused her initial right just before the games, was gracelessly ripped out at her start (100 meters of breast).
It offered a cruel scene: With a smile set up, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
As it was found that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a joyous storm.
However, there are many more athletes who start in Rio's Olympics despite doping past.
Here's a overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athlete.
He was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympician of 2004 and the Ex-World Champion even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered to be the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100 m-stafle/Jamaica): The two-fold olympia and seven-fold world champion had to sit down a six-month block after she had been proven to take the painful Oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after an operation, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatien): In 2011, the Olympiaist of 2012, the World Champion of 2013 and the European Champion of 2010 to 2016, was tested positively to the prohibited stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic contradicts the knowledge and was blocked six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): The Peking Olympics and two-fold world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and 21 months were blocked.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt dominated.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly a athlete was reconsumed afterwards by so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 WM title nine years later, after his testosteron doping was detected.
In 2004, the 40-year-old had to give off Olympia Silver for steroid drugs and the EM title 2006 for testosteron misuses.
The well-known bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was returned by the International Sports Court of CAS.
At 80,04 m, he is located on rank two of the world rank list.
Liu Hong (20 km Go, China): The world recorder and Gold Favorite was only tested positively in May, but may still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found indications of taking a prohibited food supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ran out on 13 July.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - More dead
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but she could have left this again.
Her home trip was planned for early September.
Whether the additional explosions on the vacation island of Phuket and in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok capital, was first exploded on Thursday evening in one outdoor quarter of two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and some 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday, then, two explosions went up again, whereas, according to the authorities, another man was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early days.
At the detonation near the vacation beach Patong was injured by a taxi driver, according to police statements.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb that killed a urban employee exploded.
According to the authorities, the explosion rate went to air in a flower beet in front of the coastal police department.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast were demanding several injuries.
You go out from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Armyeigeneral Danai Kritmethaveee Friday before journalists.
"We assume it's a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express itself on possible motives - probably it is the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamic rebellion or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotages which are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, they assume that the bombs were placed by opponents of the prevailing military junta.
In the past days, the authorities would have received secretary references to future attacks in the south of the country - but they would not have been informed of the exact time and places.
Still be unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are immersedly smaller bombing attacks, but mostly they are not targeting tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by the king of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the numerous bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends that it follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities on its website.
High safety risk (Security Level 3) was applicable to Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and the environment.
After controversy between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary journeys to these provinces are not recommended.
Increased safety risk (Security Level 2) was valid for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the Military Junta.
This also gives great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody disturbances, is in favour of having brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed to cope with the rebellion of Muslim rebels swelling in the very south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu step - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitary Movement" has been introduced to the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
Following several national offices, constitutional protectors have also monitored the group.
"We see at the 'identitary movement' points for efforts against the freedom of democratic principle," said Constitutional Protection Manager Hans-Georg measures of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamed extremely.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitary Movement" is a grouping of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is directed against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of its own identity through alienation".
Constitutional protectors in nine states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thüringen - already observe the "identitaries".
Measures said that his authority had agreed closely with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identitary movement' are trying to get their target group where it is", said the Constitutional Protection Manager.
Generally, extremists try to speak to them with youth-right language, often with poppy music.
This is what Islamists did as well as legal extremists.
This is not a fair advertising for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports from several federal states on contacts between "identitaries" and AfD politicians.
Measures said he had no knowledge of it.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind will only be relevant from a certain point of view.
It depends on whether the individual party - in this case the AfD - changes their target direction by certain extremists and becomes so extremely extreme.
It is therefore decisive whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is unrecognised.
In view of the significant increase in legally justified crimes and attacks on asylum candidates and refugee accommodations, measures said that he would not speak of new rights terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freetaler Group.
It may be that further legal terrorist groups or minor groups will form that plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognized.
The previous groups were created at regional level or in social networks.
Anxiety expressed that many assaults took place on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the alarming thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations had not before been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with legal extremists before, which may have been politically different or, for example, elected CDU, SPD or Linke, which have radicalized themselves by right extremist mood."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Hatte becomes Internet heat
The olympics or world records do not always determine the headers of the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros has at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming pool from Ethiopia swoop so slowly that it was sometimes not to be seen in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, having became a viral Internet heat.
In fact, the 24-year-old ended with a 48-second residue and occupied the 59th place of 59 launchers.
It was, however, rather his not just sporting figure, which drew the attention of the international media.
Why do the 24-year-old participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian was given a special start-up right from the international pool association.
This is distributed to make swimming more public in underrepresentated countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethopia, they just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros has ready for the great race.
Quickly the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel of the Whale".
The English Boulevard magazine "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he hit only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's course provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter alone in a precursor of over 100 meters.
Freneticly, Moussambani was fired at the time.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.
A seat in the front row for the breathtaking architecture of the central library of Los Angeles

Trump does not see the threatening election defeat so tight
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an electoral event in Florida.
If the choice becomes nothing with the US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just driving on his vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, he would be relatively disagreed: "Last of the time it will work, or I have a very, very beautiful, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV broadcaster CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correction, that is okay, said Trump.
He called the US president Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State of Terrorism.
Within his party, more and more resistance occurred.
Post enters trading with electrical transporters
An electric supplementary vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger seems to be great.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The group will soon start trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electrical transporters from the next year on the free car market.
"We want to go into sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is to sell its own developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages to other companies.
Post board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, such as craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "The mirror" the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and in the long term to make a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active in Germany since 2014.
GfK leadership departs after disappointing business numbers
The GfK Consumer Research Company exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The retirements came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of GfK's market research company showed that the longer the success promised by Matthias Hartmann, the chair of the board, becomes more uncertain.
Turbulence at the top of the Nürnberger Market Research Company GfK: After re-disappointing business numbers and the withdrawal of company management, the world number Five of the industry is ahead of a personal restart.
The GfK Board of Directors wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board of Arno Mahlert is already extinct from the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
On 1 September, the Board of Directors took over the former member of the Board of Directors Gerhard Hausruckinger, informed the company.
He shall officially take over the function of a "president speaker" until a successor for Hartmann was found.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details were not intended to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles, on Friday, the shareholders were finally disappointed over the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK tip since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," it said.
In view of the last bad GfK business numbers, each shareholder becomes at some point unreasonable.
"If that was the case with BMW, the quandts would also do that," said it.
The company had not been able to stop its losses even in the second quarter of 2016 after relapses in the prequartals.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable previous quarter.
As regards the first half of the year, turnover decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter has particularly stressed the company's reduced value in view of its difficult economic situation.
In the Consumer Experience business sector, depreciations of 139 million euros resulted in a loss of 148,2 million euros to the group under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had still acquired a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus out in crumb horns in graves: Eight injured
In the event of an accident of a travel bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Ironach had to avoid her information as a result of a matching truck that partly drove on the counterway.
The bus came right from the street and ran into a grave, as reported by a police spokesman of Aurich/Wittmund.
"Due to the situation of the bus, people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire force liberated the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a emergency car came to the accident location on the country road 2.
The uninjured travellers were brought back from a line bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The detectives asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of waste water shall be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (up to 2.18 euros).
The installation in Azendorf will increase the waste water fee at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After an excess calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach Country Council, it was found that undercovers for these waste water plants were found.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the installations expensively on the basis of legal basis.
From 1 October 2016, citizens and industry companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the money bags.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
According to Herbert Schmidt's administrative director, a re-calculation of the fees was necessary for the wastewater facilities of the market community.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers were also compensated for the previous calculation period.
The graving fee increases found Schmidt that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the small distribution base, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, waste water consumption in all three plants is slightly declined.
In addition, in the calculating period backwards, all three installations were not least affected by their age of recovery and repair expenditure to a considerable extent.
The installation in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the installations for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the waste water system Azendorf due to damage.
In the pump work Welschenkahl the nearly 20-year-old funding facilities had to be overloaded from the ground, and at the laundry clothing system Lopp had to be baked out after nearly 20 years of operation of the first clothing pitch, disposed of the clothing sludge and an additional ventilation possibility to comply with the water laws in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses resulted in the due maintenance and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhausen made it clear that in the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the costs for operation and maintenance are "to be fully covered".
In this respect, supplemented Schmidt, the market community has been spared of large entertainment costs in the waste water plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these installations will continue to be permanently precarious in the view of stone houses, since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste water association cannot be extended to these installations because it is deficit facilities.
Bulgaria is booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (from June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, as positive 0.2%.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured after the CPI -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as last month in alcoholic drinks and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identitys in such a way that already borders the absurd.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unblemished, distortion tools that create more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures are made public.
Snapchat filters have in the past drawn criticism in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or white skin as beauty sideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them shields, false teeth, and darkened wings, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelb face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversy points to a greater problem that the company has diversity.
The news and the wrath were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat informed that it had disabled the feature.
The company apologized: The filter was intended as a hommage of anime characterists and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injuring clichés.
Others decisively rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Savepani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely distributed about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and gently said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the contradiction of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face was drawn into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.
And Snapchats' large audience of young people - who are in matters of races more than their older counterplayers - could rather assume to expect awareness.
If one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In a set of media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended with a hash day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Anyway she has no different representation of people with other skin colours in their occupation, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but not in positions where they feel safe or well to say something about it."
Others share their views, a complaint that has mostly left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday it refused Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but, according to one speaker, the company has recently set up a personnel responsible, focusing on sub-represented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said to her that she will let her Snapchat account be closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not OK."
Military management defects ISIS Secret Service Information, lays down the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed information on telecommunications to draw a optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the site, a Congress investigation committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, drawn up by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Security Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analytists who reported how directors altered their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News Service Information, typically cut by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly draws a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on the site and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," quoted a newspaper article.
"What happened to Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, a republic member of the Representative House.
The management errors in centcom range up to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows detailed constant problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi army.
Although there is no direct evidence that government points under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analytists were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before the convention were significantly more positive than the facts" the report stated.
For example, a centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, republic congress delegate from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the newsletter reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analytists were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Defence Ministry's General Inspector are in progress.
On Thursday, democratic members of the Committee on News Services published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of telecommunications assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest level democracy in the committee, member of the Adam B. ship representative house.
This process, said Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of postal reports," damaged the morality among analytists and "are excessively low in space for different opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats argued that there were no evidence of the White House's intervention at the Centcom Analytists regarding a "definite political opinion".
The provisional results of the Congress investigations were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, which were initiated after complaints by Centcom Analysts.
Lieutenant Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the Congress reports while the investigations by the General Inspector were still in progress.
But he also argued that "experts sometimes have very diversified opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the news services and the Defence Ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have an impact on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now being made by a growing number of members of the Defence Ministry).
However, the accusations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes from more than ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush, in contrast with the recommendations of many analysts, planned only a small crew force in Iraq and spent little time on thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to governmental bodies, found that, in contrast to the state of the government, airs against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the Terrorist Group, since these temporary refineries had taken place in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reports the Times in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain is coming
One day after she shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.
"I don't know." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows that the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic Battle and are as well in their group with the British in the first place after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinal, the game will decide which of the two within their group will get the first and second place from six teams each.
The first placed one will go a little longer away from the strong Dutch women leading the other group.
Whatever the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising spine by their success story, four years after they landed at the past London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time with three years she had a hockey hit in hands (the two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), when she was 16 years old, she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012 came where everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year, Craig Parnham, an Englisher, trainer of the National Team, began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work course in London, which we have now.
We've been able to screw all the rods around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the torches in the first half of the game with a back handcuff from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tight and kept the play from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and jumped the ball into the gate to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The closeout was the first of all the tournament for the United States' gatekeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the wrath of the Olympic Games, the cen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and inevitable, a fast pace between competition and pursuits.
It's as if the Olympic Fackel would be a burning rod that is given from the bracelet shooter to swim to the tower to the triathlet.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who for the first time joined the Olympic Games and is a woman's swarm with graves, could have been quite under these famous names that were sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-feeling TV advertising if he was a swimmer, towerer or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolin Tour.
The Olympic Flame does not light any event equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports types that are not generally recognized: air guns, archers, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the breast swimming and have it to rule for a long time.
But if I should humbly argue for my favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Though the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had been debuted in Sydney, it has been noticed so hard for the last 16 years that many of the ones I had interviewed have not known that it is an Olympic portal at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had a athlete who made it until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthly enthusiasm.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartony shaking of its never ending the wild shaking - but also the grass of the tour and diving, the two sports kinds that mainly unite it.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "Springboard".
Rise winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a series of falling movements (twisting, hooking and saltos) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to official Olympia programmes following execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will join each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is straight out.
Medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes back and up, up and down on the playground.
They are not only chasing the target line or the starting wall, but also in television transmission a further chinish goal: the world or the Olympia record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to touch even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I myself feel as a little tired when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a tempaus.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the target.
He or she screams off, seemingly harshless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then untrained back up.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hactic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.
It's as much as competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualifications and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon at Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will radiate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be ignored in general tumult.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the accumulation and objectification of male athletes - as was suggested by the male US tourners, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his new fan community ringing to air.
"One generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a allyte of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants who demand political changes in Ethiopia are encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that twenty protesters were killed during the conflicts with the police in case of shooting change.
Is Ethiopia just breaking together?
In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid alliance of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in the last few months, protests against the government shook the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government’s response was undeserved.
Witnesses argued that policemen shot and killed on ten unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests that are likely from the last or the beginning of this year show how safetymen hit young people with stokes, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The Head of the United Nations Human Rights Assistants now requires an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populating country in Africa in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat threats of terrorism beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable rate.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new pendulum train in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was everything other than a model of democracy - human rights organisations have constantly led to the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or to prison, killed, or driven into the wide parts of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
One generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to wreck grip in relation to the power of the ruler coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the Government Party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this cracky, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytists fear that separaters, such as the Oromo-freeing front or the National Release Front of the Ogad, who have been more or less distressed over recent years, can benefit from turbulence and re-arm.
Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness now explode after years of the inclination under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and the Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially when they protest, many people can still communicate via Internet proxys that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians argued that they were so gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the oromas and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The oromas and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Eyes, the Amharas, who come from mainly Christian highlands in Ethopia, have prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the oromas of which are many Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's just changing.
"We are in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which are about 6 percent of the population and dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the disturbance is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years old Prime Minister of Ethiopia for an unpublished disease in 2012 until his death.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analytists say that he was particularly delicate in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to process opponents and to make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analytic.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytists say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analyticals, seemed to have been suspended by the government and then stolen.
During the following racities, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last few months and this time of disturbance passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, and for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgrace of the Ethiopian government.
And she adopts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked businesses conducted by Tigray in Gondar, an amharic city, and hatred against the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.
Analytists say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. Government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights over the neighbouring Somalia, even though she recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin crying migration."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS was "Sarkasm".
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign, indicating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been seriously mentioned by the "founders" of the Islamic State Terror Group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republicans presidential candidate, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his competitors, who strive to protect him during an eventual phase, into the strange position to have to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the announcement at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump restored to the claim on Thursday and argued in interviews that he did not really indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day at which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama ISIS wanted to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism triggers Mr Trump, while he tried to focus his campaign on falling survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this topic again.
He warned on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.
At the end of July he took strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained "Of course I meant that sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic limits in politics and then rewind back on demand.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, where appropriate, "explain" depending on what the reaction is." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of decompressing the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted a even more urgent sound, as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great advance in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally trys not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is focusing on attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes have brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent speakers of Trumps, made great efforts to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is legitimate political comments," so Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the truth of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS, it was a almost unknown little organization, he called them back benchlers, completely wrong, and so it happened because he departed the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream republics try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and ordered them to be predominant against each of his words.
He defeated the "arm, sad" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democratics spotted Mr. Trump's apologies as just another evidence that he was inappropriate to the Presidential Office.
Once expelled from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a cheese café in Williamsburg, where only a bar could be paid that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront.
The business Soap Cherie, which replaced verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Inhabitants grieved it as the last loss in a gentificing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is a change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is a change, it's also a new invention.
A relived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one miles north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employees of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new outside office, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food map there are sandwiches with speck and cheese and there are garnations like caps and acided onions.
There are natural travel shoes.
The café no longer serves beer, for that there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady stream of old ancestors.
"Many old customers were also expelled by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on one Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way to herself.
After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was about coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a mixed chai tea, which is another new addition, instead of her usual Iced Coffees.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and always ordered the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepared my Everything bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his ordinary order, but sometimes he switches his Everything-Bagel with speck, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he was not grudging that the soap business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-brown coffee of the coffee as ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go on their offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to exhibit it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-burned coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a ancestor and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that joining the locale and ordering felt a new coffee like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing meal of the economic crisis in a "abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a facility for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoe pepper and as a dessert a plow pudding.
"It was a act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Tegelman in its book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publisher on Tuesday, illustrates the history of the American cuisine during the great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the Stock Exchange Crash in 1929.
Tegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthan with potato purple and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this was appropriate for a discussion of food in the era of Great Depression.
"Real foods were very popular," said Tegelman.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe laughed.
"It must have layed in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Women's crew cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways that the country was dealing with to stop being the scaroff land.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," said Coe, "why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as excited: Mysterious foods such as bread and cash rolls were made for basic nutrients to re-use the cash roll as "wonderful kind, food rests", said Tegelman, since kitchens were able to hide inappropriate ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the American kitchen for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tested because a calories-rich and nourishing satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Tegelman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at the noon," said Coe.
Tegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Petroleum butter and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household receptions.
Like never before or since, budgetary operators - including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Office of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drew the eating habits of the country in such a way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become household politicians and the challenge of transforming pamps like cream spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historic delicious bites.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasteful.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchens of his kitchen, he ate like the millions of heavy man of the world, to which he became.
"He liked continental kitchen like fish with gurkensauce," said Coe.
He ate in a almost golden dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderful reality stranger.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not invited him to statue an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a householder with no interest in taste directions by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the boringest food in Washington, but also one of the most disastrous preparations."
Many of the species from the Era of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs.
The descendation lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Tegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When the couple wrote the book, they had better understanding the eating habits of Tegelman's mother-in-law - for example how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," said Coe.
Tegelman remembered: "She really made people sick."
There was the windbag event.
After the plates had been removed at Eisenberg's, they and Coe moved out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumning sert, the President Roosevelt at lunch.
"It's called Prue Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a sensible name.
There was no beaten snake, only plows, some flour, sugar, water and cimt.
Everyone would do something unwillingly with a leaf in the tight brown glabber.
Surprisingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe got a look three times.
Like a Can-Do-Budgetier, he said to his wife, "Some hacked walnuts would help."
Killed at bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old even died in a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to the image show, has saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 Volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first help in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the Civil Protector, showing him at an 11-hour salvation of a baby from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a glorious symbol in the greyness of the war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said, "For me, this is the real Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself attacked the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four faces bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with Chorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathlessness.
"We now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime should have hit terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest spinal animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in the winter.
This shark was allowed back to the sea after an investigation on the Sanda research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with just one km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only receive 150 years of growth.
In common, the greenlandhai swims along the ground of the northern Atlantic, in an hour, it comes on average just 1.220 meters away.
Only when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates on set 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robe with this maximum speed.
This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent concept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the magazine "Science" of a Greenlandhai that could be 392 years old.
Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this lifespan that means a world record for spinal animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, eventually they live in the eimers above the thin coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbards.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of the greenland sharks.
They measured their time lupentrate when they equipped six animals with a transmitter before the top mountains.
Yet prostitution makes these sharks: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the jaw leg of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the ground of the Eimer and look for Kadaver, who turns down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 greenland sharks, who took fishermen from 2010 to 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitzbergen as adjacent to the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 cm was measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon 14-methode of the shark's lens core.
This center of eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempted to throw greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts with a length of 220 cm, so it was probably celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
On the other hand, all larger greenland sharks had normal carbon-14 quantity in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 cm long greenland shark age of 335 years, while the record-hai with 502 cm may even be 392 years old.
The fact that greenlandhai females will not have grown until they are more than four meters, was known.
Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold for gender maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, greenland sharks are evidently at least one and a half centuries of time.
This is probably also a world record for spinal animals at present.
The fact that such methusalems live primarily in ice waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in which the speck stood at the neck a 120-year-old harpun tip, was caught in front of Alaska.
The low temperatures often also lead to the organism of the live animals on fire.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than for a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible," explains the evolution biologist Schuerlein.
A very large animal, however, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
Topics around building have been focused on the Community during the recent meeting.
With facilitation, the board took up the communication by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the newly identified housing areas can eventually start".
After clarifying the matters of land, parceling and exclution and the applications for measurement, the sale of land in the residential areas of Straßlweg and Schönau-West (Region Binderstraße – Extended Section 1) is no longer in the way to stakeholders.
The municipality is convinced that the construction sites in the countryly characterised and quiet residential community Schönau also respond to young families and calm seniors.
As it said, builders can immediately report at the Council's House, the parcel award is expected to be consulted by the municipality at its September session.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of further businesses, associated with the creation of jobs, the Community decided to amend the area utilisation plan that was created in sub-sectors only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the area of Subtimern, the already designated commercial area is expanded by two parallels towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Main has the best chances in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg to attract jobs and companies shifted from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigland, head of the field of competence of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have had enough authorisation in the UK.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced shifting jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW speaks the European Central Bank (ECB), united responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the note bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voichtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large funding industry, it has been cut off as well as Dublin's infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
There are also points in the city with easy-to-available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Vochtland.
In addition, the rents for first-class commercial property are 50 percent higher than the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of the Mercer Corporate Consultation, the city is on the 7th place, Luxembourg on the 19th place, Dublin on place 33 and Paris on 37th place.
Although life quality is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW follows.
However, despite Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
For this reason, the power conditions are: in London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, about 144000 people in the banking industry, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc had the right to reimbursement of the legal costs resulting from the Hepatitis C judicial dispute with the Pharmaceutical Company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was exempted from a $200 million injury payment for the injury of two patents from Merck, which were associated with the Sovaldi and Harvoni Blockbuster medicines of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misconduct since Mercks, including the Minide and other unethical acts.
When the complaint was brought up on Thursday, US Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to adopt the costs arising during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to draw along with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case depends on the 2013 year when Gilead and Merck accused each other and took possession of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S. supported troops say that they have renamed full control over Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S. supported troops have taken full control over the northern city of Manbij back near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) come through the city now after the exclusion of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have liberated more than 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as hostages, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbij Military Council of Reuters connected with the DC.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just carrying out cleaning work," he said Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which gave the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for well-acting purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton earned nearly USD 5.3 million in speaking honoraries; the former Foreign Minister gave USD 3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements in the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a cruel contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," wrote Clinton's campaigner assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, as regards the publication of the presidential candidate for democracy.
On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trumps Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are not completed.
Trumps critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made clear that his refusal has raised questions regarding assets, its donations for well-acting organisations, its business behavior and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, where high-range Republican Trump invites to publish his tax declaration.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump did not pay taxes for two years during the 1990s, or only very few taxes, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal Taxes have become a topic in the campaign of elections.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that persons who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate here has its seat, to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax examination of the IRS and Trump had "fear" for the voters and not for the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declarations declines until 2007.
The Clintons, who are now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax declaration showed that these amounted to only USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main monetary facility was a cost-effective index fund from which Clinton's dividends and revenues from USD 109.000 were taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks bodies promote Tanzania Elephant protection
Natural Protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to prevent elephants from going into human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honey Guide Foundation, which had the idea already years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a violent four-level approach to protect their homes and harvests without injury to animals.
Many spices used before to defend themselves.
Friday is the world elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the manager of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a message.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a flash and the blowing in a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with Earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condoom, whose end is turned to the lighting snow.
When it is burned, the condom places up with a knife and sprinkles fine dust on chilipuder into the air.
A shove is usually already quite out to chase the elephants.
One last option is a warper who shoots a gold rain fireworks in the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, St. Goarer's investment projects by traders with kiss hand are considered to be significantly expansionable for retail trade in the city.
However, the urban council unanimously rejected the application for the reconstruction of a sales squio on the Rhine Balcony in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony.
"In principle we welcome new traders, but at this location in exposed position on the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director defeated Berlin's hotel because Israeli pre-selection was removed after "arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots uncovered a media rebellion after he had told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli choice, since it had Arab guests "required" according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country selection list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure is a "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it provoked more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were disturbed and disturbed by this event.
That's really disgraceful.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in the exact hotel chain is even a greater shame.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty large resonance on the Internet, where the people all called a scandal.
Some understood to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "released" the claimed demands of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it said in another contribution, pointing out that the hotel located on the noblical Kurfürstendamm is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the accusations from itself and called the incident an "insane" and "forgive" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country election has now been added.
Police uses tear gas and rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students collapsed with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officials tried to break the students, resulting in the use of rubber shots and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen kicking Graffitits against the preliminary president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from the office by a vote of the Senate for their withdrawal.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the suspension of sanctions grew by 70,9 per cent in comparison to Moscow and Teheran.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were suspended, the interest on the Russian companies in businesses in the country grew strongly, the ambassadors informed.
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, further trading is one of the most important priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased with 91.5 percent jumping and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trading rise was achieved by deliveries of machinery, agriculture and weapons," said the ambassador.
For this year, Dzhagaryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something from which the Ambassador hopes it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: Drinking market in forest brown
A robbery was committed on the drinking market of Rewe XXL on the forest bröler Gerberstraße on the Thursday evening.
Under the preservation of a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had muddled their faces demanded the release of cash from the hire of the drinking market and then fleeed at foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW-golf.
How much money was spent, the police do not communicate.
The killers were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters large, i.e. relatively small.
The drinking market is directly available from the parking deck of the Rewe market and is badly accessible.
After the assault, the offenders must run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flee from the parking parking with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (schladernring).
Anyone who made observations related to the robbery at the time of action (at 7:45 p.m.) should report to the police urgently.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and adolescents spent the social pedagogical daily group/social group work of the Nagold Kinderschutzbund with their maintainers at their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located recreational home Hardtwaldle, the lively group was inspected during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other hand, there was a special child leadership in the world - famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the daily life and the food of the Keltes.
In the hot days, the group at the Deep Sea enjoyed it in Mulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and plans.
Culinary children and maintainers with their own prepared lips such as the saur end, the sea sourcer pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry from pearls and stones was created, or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Further highlights of recreation were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at fire and the final "Bunde Evening".
On the day of the home trip, the sun and the children and youths were happy to return home.
Hair hole: Pilgrimages to the courts of mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were managed.
In order to break the time up to the next Rome Wall tour of all ministers in expected two years, the Chief Ministerial Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrim migration.
Several goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercifulness with the gates of mercy opened on Freiburger Münster, a special pilgrim goal was offered.
16 Minis of Bittel Bronne, Gruol, Haigerhole, and Holy Rooms made themselves on the way.
On the evening before, Father Great East sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and delivered the pilgrims.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a münster of Our loved wife stands and thus the pilgrimage was entered by the münster.
The individual day tours were framed at morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the road, the minis of field crosses, chapels or churches made repeatedly rust to sing together a song from a specially composed pilgrim songbook.
The nights were available for the parishes of local parishes.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
On the next day, the phase of St. Peter, which was the most effortful roadway, had to go down about 500 metres [500 m] and then be climbed again.
The reward was a common barbecue in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilger Day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visiblely, and happyly, the Minis met in the afternoon of Freiburger Münster and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the Pilger Target were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After worship, the pilgrimages were able to visit the Sakristei and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
Afternoon it went back to Horb by railway.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterized.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when Brite Gold rings for bicycle sports
Schotland Callum Skinner raged last night at the men's team-sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to the glory when the British team defended the title of London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow took the anchor roll that his landlord Sir Chris Hoy had made himself. The young pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to embrace a victory of the favorites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympiagold medals.
They repeated the trick after they got only a modest sixth place at the London Railway Championships despite the retirement of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the peers Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as obstacles appeared.
Hoy's retirement caused a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the scotch that has now emerged.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put an Olympia record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
After his round, it was almost back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategic change was a large part of the transformation, where the Hinds drove in a higher gang to slow it down and allow Kenny and, above all, skinners to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out from his position as a BBC expert and fell up Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got up to the pod.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set up an Olympic record in the Endrande and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys page, Hinds admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the railway.
He withdrawn this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such a superb victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all GB flags."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got so bad away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympic Piade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has been won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys, it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic Gold Medals in a competition.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a prey of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the one from Hoy.
Kenny will take part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometres.
They arrived at the target in 3:51.942.
The World Record, won in London Gold in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be in focus with certainty.
He had struggled with officers before qualification yesterday when functionaries called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in the world record time in 4:13.260.
The GB team relys on its strong train wheel team to dominate the mean period of the Olympic Games and to get a crowd of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were disappeared.
There was drama in the background, so the retirement of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexualism and mobing assaults, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when one looks at the first night of competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary call of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its climax, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland's smelting due to the abolition of the energy contract
The future of Portland's aluminium melts in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator is terminating the energy supply contract and will thus abolish all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company has notified.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered by closing.
In addition, domino effects could be achieved as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Meltingery, which resulted in the closing of the Anglesea power station last year.
Alcoa's melting in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation of the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and ultimately because of the electricity price for the installation.
AGL, which provides the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, informed that it is expected that three other owners will announce their contracts.
The plant is largely owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company informed.
AGL continued to say that the Treaties were so-called "security businesses" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month annulment deadline, so they will end in 2017.
"The AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue during the 17th financial year," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL noted that it has already deprecated the value of the contracts at $187 million in "expected a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting industry" does not affect.
The U.S. company said that in 2010 a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, was concluded, even if it was still a declaration of why it was withdrawn from the Treaty.
Analytics warn against the possible closure of Portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the statements of analytics at the beginning of the week, head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts and tomago around 900 megawatts on electricity annually.
If both investments disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [stream market].
And that wouldn't be good for us as a power producer," he said.
More than a carddashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I loved brought me the sight of this covers to cry," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the carddashians similar?), written reality video, showing the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems of Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and end with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the climbing action nearly every birthday episode of a children's broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?", with the honesty of a drawing rabbit at a station at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to make her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly started.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her with the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a range that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (as stated in fashionista were of the 832 pages of the whale 615 pages advertising).
The discovery of his cover star is so longed to expect that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were weakened before official notice.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there were clearly more "confidentialities, models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar prize manager and dior brand messenger Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even in the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "transgression model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or adolescents of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of it applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are characterized in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had published lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a bit excited.
In June, the honest Victoria's Secret Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems the point to pass on the dismay.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the real sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she's watching the reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's needs are rejected annually by the Community law centres, while the industry has the impact of further reductions on transactions already overloaded.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unfair delegations and similar things - are already rejected in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exhausted, are prepared for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the municipality centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights showed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only become worse without a repeal of the decision of the Federal Government.
"Queensland Municipality Centres are chronicly underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inconsistent and impressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will shorten the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the General Lawyer and the Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these reductions immediately, so that people can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise appropriations for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipalities and their customer communities and to invest Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees claimed to have taken a gun
New York: Donald Trumps Campaign was accused of claimed inactivity after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina had sent a gun to an employee in February while they were on a Jeep in February.
The event is described in a prosecution issued on Wednesday in the court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.
Bordini argued that he had waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right point finger on the decline, and hit the run in Vincent's Knickahle," boarding Bordini in his charge.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other persons had already experienced the same experience with Phillip, he announced in the prosecution.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican president's candidate triggered an upset when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - guns owners and arms friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of the context and that he wouldn't provoke to violence.
Bordini's complaint requires damage replacement of the campaign for injury to care and Philip for body injury and lasting mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was unreachable for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
On calls at his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstsgericht, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Country election survey: Lose SPD and CDU
In the forthcoming elections in the Mecklenburg Prepommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.
This resulted in representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "picture" design (freeday).
While the red-black government coalition could hardly go on in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In both states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thereby have good chances to continue with the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only shortly ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 per cent (previously 18,4 per cent), the AfD would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in the land day.
In spite of mild losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) the Greens retired to the heavy country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day by 3 per cent each.
In the Berlin Member's election, the SPD would only be 23% (choosing 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (fore 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 percent in the House of Members for the first time.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope that the pirates would miss the return in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The followers today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost a half kg and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it was not well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.
The built-in storage was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for some two selfies with a high resolution today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone time of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced the product on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover a few months earlier as "Büro in Westentascheformat".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to get a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was accessible.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, even painfully slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded out like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. approximately 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could realize that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and disposed of to Microsoft.
Today the market dominates suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always be online and everywhere, this is today for very many people everyday.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple alone, 555 million pieces.
The global turnover with the devices is about 400 billion euros.
This includes the well-running transactions of countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has now developed around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market arrived only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicationer to use everything easily via touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is a naturality 20 years after its invention.
Nowadays each German looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," just said Janina Ball, responsible for staff in the Siemens Board.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as curse and blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country, not only in our local communities and throughout London.
For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrows, as did in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new schools, 40,000 new jobs, and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement Heathrows is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame on the world stage.
The twoflers were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth, and leave an abbreviation of skills and employment both in order to leave the airport as well as the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from T5 - which has been elected five years in success to the world's best airport terminal, until T2, which has been built in the middle of the two most frequently most frequent courses of the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion of private investments.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, to ensure our future trade and create a prominence of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Katz and Mouse Game" related to adblocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to avoid advertising blocking are similar to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block adblocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that its desktop page would change the codec regarding its advertising to detect advertising blocks the detection of which part of the page Advertising is difficult.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to avoid the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this type of combat between the advertising open source community and the surroundings have already been in progress since the invention of adblockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how anxious advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study from the last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are using adblockers; almost four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users accessing Facebook via their mobile end devices daily, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising.
The company has devoted it to advertising blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile advertising blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs represents a sufficient proportion of revenues, so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that it would update its "view preference tool" in order to have more control over their targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocks would be anxious about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"For the users this does not represent a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook speaker informed in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a stupid means, so instead we focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
If suicide is presumed to be carried on to a Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was driven on a motorway in the early mornings on Thursday at a suicide suicide suicide from several vehicles.
The event occurred on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in a act of despair" on the street and was hit by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is evident that a Swiss woman aged 49 who was driven by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the ground.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police, who invited them and every witness of the incident to report.
A investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains to wait for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not drawn to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a footgänger runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released for the suspicious killing after she had crossed and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court took up.
The court found that the policeman – who had responded to an emergency call – was driving in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, the Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density atmosphere could once have shown earthly conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly continued.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to stay alive and protected from faster dilution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms up the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainscreen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus, similar to evolution, which was presumed before by planet researchers.
Although it once was likely to be inhabitable, the Venus – over several billion years – was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans diluted and their water vapour was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogens disappeared, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a mortal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and led to too little co-determining right in the decision-making process of the team.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
In the course of the summer, I've been thinking about how to improve this team to give it more depth, this needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey operation must be perfectly aligned with the organisation.
It must also have a co-determining law in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded as the winner of the Jack Adams Award during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best trainer of the League.
He led the association to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell back behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North sea oil workers reopen conversations, terminate strike
Working fights on remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all dispute parties are sitting at the table for a new discussion round, said negotiating leaders.
Streiks against the Oil Field Service Provider Wood Group were performed sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next few weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to resolve the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea this year by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10-percent reduction for Unshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the space needed to get through the market decline.
For its part, Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas businesses in up to 10 countries, since it rationalises its business activities as a result of its mega merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower routine travel, a economic situation that has been strengthened by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes that have been held in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rates of stars in the plejaden stars
The latest mission with the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the pledges.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why stars rotate to different rates in the stars and in what context the rotation periods are with the planetary expansion.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The plejaden stars are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star bunch, which developed about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning faster now.
At the top rotation rates, these mature stars extinguish large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, his rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by acknowledging the time between the appearance of a conscious star spot -- as sun spots --
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower pirouettes than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejaden we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, but faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star bunch of the plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stabler quality such as rotation rates.
"The star bunch of plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stable rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There's still a lot ahead of us that we'd like to learn more about how the How, When, and Why Stars slow their rotation rates and, as it were, hang up their dance shoes.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports detailedly about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of plejaden, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star descends
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional retirement notice, the 41-year-old professional will last be wearing the tricot of his New York Yankees against Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say "Goodbye" to both," explained the 14-fold All-Star-Game-Participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player of the League, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has made him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid back Rodriguez for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the glory hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
In 2009, the Superstar at "ESPN" admitted to taking forbidden steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties by the end of 2014 because of a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is regarded as the principal suspicious, for years through an anti-aging hospital in South Florida to have received power-promoting funds.
After a dispute, the block was still reduced to 162 meetings.
"The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break," said Rodriguez then suffisant.
Also, his divorce days do not go noiseless.
While many baseball teams in their last games have received the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, who was afterdoged with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, the sympathy advertisements of the fans of the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Targetinski are first baptism cases
Taken: Due to a positive doping sample, the weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official baptism cases.
A captured athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, the 3,000-meter-historic runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the light athletic competitions that were critical.
The diuretics of hydrochlorothiazide, used as a masking agent for doping substances, had been demonstrated in Chen last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the advances over 50 m free style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation with Chen in the investigations", quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and accept the judgment".
The first time in history is not the IOC anymore, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Similarly, in the night of Rio, the news about the positive sample in Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "a incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV transmitter BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the light athlete.
The report suggests that the prohibited substance is the EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-examine should also have been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately criticized the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, some of the weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympicser in the class up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier, as his brother Tomasz, positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both disputes the revenue, but both may not start up to 94 kg in class.
Before the start of the light athletes, in particular the case of Danekowa is another difficult battle for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF had banned the entire Russian crew to an exception for systematic doping, also the running Kenia produces numerous bad news in Rio.
Furthermore, in swimming sports, the former transgressions in China had also provided for violent disputes between the athletes.
Thus the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinched purple."
"If I see the podium more than 200 m free style, I want to surrender," said Lacourt on the French radio.
Sun was also focused on a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraud," said this.
In 2014, Sun was tested positively to the stimulan trimetazidine in the Chinese championships, but only a three-month block had to be seated.
Data: So perfide express Hacker her ransom
Programmers of extortion malware are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies in question have been at least once, partly multiplely victims of an attack with erpresser software in the past twelve months.
Already 20 percent of companies in Germany have once been the target of Ransomware-expression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the transgressors to re-use the attacked systems and data.
According to the observations of malwarebytes, the actors specialize in their erpresser software, seeing attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially exhaustive ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly fast evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "Welt".
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the deceaseds discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to companies attacks has been terrifyingly fast over the past few months.
Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, searching for newly modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and delete the originals sustainablely.
Next, the software presents the demands of the oppressors.
In order to get the end-encryption code to the files, the victims have to convey money - mostly in the form of the Crypto currency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is still.
Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.
22 per cent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt business entirely, in one case people were in life risk.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical documents.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the deceivers in view of stopping in operation.
The hackers know this again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user surfaces and contact with the pressers and come to the result: the offenders are actually trying to build a type of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, configure freely accessible support websites or decrypt without delay example files.
And if private persons are resolved after payments from a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from Ransomware extortion, the hackers become more and more professional and share their work, safety expert Chester Wisniewski explains by the antivirus provider Sophos: "One individual can write a ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their damaged software in the form of a software-building box to the actual oppressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"Included in the delivery range is an adapter tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and burning can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The oppressors then look for more hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals then commission spam with the distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies who better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of companies-IT responsible in the malwarebytes survey trust in defending Ransomware by file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the transgressors are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erpesion, the criminals are threatening the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential of damage depends on the type of data is much higher than before.
In the future, the actors could also take up completely new goals on the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat linked to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such blocked heating could be quite worth a ransom for some victims.
If the killers then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé, and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was designed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, is actually extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the first row and in the Fund, it does not seem tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and act pleasantly, only the cockpit-overs are somewhat disappeared.
The HR-V is more widely than comparable vehicles in the vacuum.
It is not only available a suitcase of 453 l in high-level and 1026 l in rounded back leans, but there are the "Magic Seaats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the rear bank's seat surfaces can be flip up like cinema seals, thus offering space that is from the ground to the cover 1,24 m high.
The suitcase can be loaded well, but the load height is slightly higher with 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation ranges.
However, he is supposed to do his work somewhat slower.
The daily consumption is pleasant of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engineization: a 1.5 l benzine with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-rad drive is not offered.
The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
However, the control should be slightly more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top version "Executive".
The security systems include the City Notbrems Assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he considers many obstacles as "coming objects".
The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent tempo controller responds to the traffic mark detection and, if necessary, disturbs the speed.
But there is full connectivity only for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI books are under the arm lean and are therefore something to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are okay.
Those who do not want to invest so much receive the petroleum from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: crash on a passenger bridge
An airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For a liability is only possible in the case of dangers typically for air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Act.: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant had broken a knee sheet at the crash.
However, the accident could have occurred everywhere - it is a general life risk, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damage.
Disease: When the organiser pays
Diseased holidays will only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family on the second day of their Turkish vacation was severely ill by diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost all the vacation in the room.
Their disease led the holidays to a defective cleaning system that claimed to have polluted the seawater.
The family believed that the journey was inadequate - and complained against the organiser.
In court, the prosecutors had no success.
Although the clearing system was actually defective.
However, the organiser learned of it only shortly before the complainant departed.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was okay.
So he did not violate his information obligations, according to the judgment.
In particular, no pollution was found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly through inflammation among each other - is a general life risk.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The State must react consciously and decisively at the same time to terrorist risks.
Surely, our land will not answer the violence of the transgressors with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be a triumph to the terrorists.
However, if criminals have to leave the country faster, this increases security and strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the Bundestagswahl 2017.
He also announced a further personal reinforcement of security forces, which is "in a moderate four-scale order for several years".
Sympathetic heritage for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, the right to arms is so novelled that it is particularly difficult to buy weapons on the Internet.
The last much discussed silence obligation for doctors is to be preserved according to de Maizière's words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctors, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of citizens, he said about psychic insights.
In order to counteract the radicalization of refugees, the minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use detected detectives.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Interior Minister stated clearly against actionism.
"This was an earfig for the scarfmakers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel the newspapers of the Funke Media Group ( Friday).
The Mayzière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-slepping is considered to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid anything you refuse, and I refuse to carry the Burka.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter sent to the minister to simulate with always new anti-terror packages of action and action ability.
Links-Parteichef Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotts of speeches and a worsening of the right of residence brings people in this country no more security."
Better transport flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the legal deviation track is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are busy on the surrounding road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) the country's road construction is prolonging the legal route between the Hammer Road and the departure of Wessel Road by 700 meters.
Car drivers can then twist directly from the Hammer Street to the right.
The great advantage: Transport is divided early, thus improving the overall expiry on the much-fixed section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representation Münster-West.
The railway connection on the trailer nerves the car drivers mainly between 17 and 19.
Working days the backstage extends to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond it.
ground is the needle tube on the B 51 just before the departure of the Wessel Street.
From here, traffic is only spurously directed through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be reconstructed for some quarters ago.
The reason: Static calculations showed that the bridge no longer had the necessary viability to take in two ways of heavy load traffic.
How long this close passport and the work-day bargain associated with it will last, the competent national holding cannot say.
However, years are expected: for the bridge has an official remaining use duration by 2034.
For the extension of the legal perspective, the national company has deliberately chosen the weaker time in school holidays because of disabilities to be expected.
Traffics will be carried by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural travel: Culture offers for schools
The international class of forest school visited the theatre piece "The Invisible House".
The club of Nima and the young theatre are planning a musical project now.
The Nima's Association allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "class International" of the forest school Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the prize-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the Association of Nima, 19 students aged 11 to 15 visited the stage in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association which has set the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background aims to visit schools with welcome classes in Münster under this project.
Most of the young people of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among others, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they have been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the young Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languageel, and the young theatre will work together in the coming playtime in a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of song, dance, act and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theater game and theatre language mediation are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the rising numbers of refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star snoops: Hope of weather improvement
The weather has made the starsnippers in the southwest of Germany a strike through the bill on Friday in the night - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the spectacle of heaven, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we'll see a lot of star snoops in the sky.
The starships are Perseads, one of the fastest stars with 216000 kilometres per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus that rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening, you're walking around forever, you're staying awake for hours, the morning is long before the wakeball is no longer thinking of sleep.
It's all other than relaxing.
After all, you have such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as unrecognised.
How are sleep problems or sleep disorders expressed?
There are several forms of sleep disturbance, and there can be many reasons to them, Hans-Günter Weeter, director of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what you understand is the insomnia, that is, an insomnia and sleep disturbance.
Just sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Board of Directors of the German House doctors Association with practice in the Low Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
There are organic, psychical or behavioural factors behind them, but also medicines.
Uncommonly, sleep disorders are expressions of another disease.
"Very early awakening is common in a depression," says Wessen.
And it may be that different factors affect each other.
For example, if you have a band disc incident, you may find it bad to wake up every two to three hours, and you may begin to cruel over everyday problems and care, wearing is an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you are not sleeping well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected on the day, you should go to your doctor, take care.
The insufficiency may look very different: you are disturbed, tired, unsleeped, have difficulties with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
To reduce sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.
Treatment options include behavior changes, cognitive behavior therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets are only questioned in exceptional cases and at least for two weeks.
In Germany, there are hardly downgoing sleep medicines, underlined Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, when you have sleep problems, you should first contact the home doctor, Wessen advises.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the lab, and what's happening?
For the study in the bedroom, doctors are advised, for example, in the case of snorches with athemaus sets, in sick day tiredness, in sleeping migrants, or when you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body, you carry a noseglass, a breast belt and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera at the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can the subjects handle the problems?
There are quite many screws that can be used for better sleep.
Wear counts on: regular sleep and resurrection times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not sleep on TV for sleeping, avoid alcohol, and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that is completely not helpful.
What the jungle camp has with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had collected gold for the first time at the shortway world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has set himself protecting from his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country in which an olympician receives a premium of 20,000€ and a jungle king of 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old in the night on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that are very much promoting and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even do it.
"I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, he had to be reported more deliberately nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
It is the same way to keep it with countries.
"Who cannot take part for a certain time before WM/OS by independent controllers of WADA/FINA," the electoral Hamburger, who now operates an ice part.
Airport: bands of baggage thiefs arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of the Düsseldorf Police were arrested on Thursday of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years.
The suspects had committed several baggage and baggage steels as bands.
At 21.30 p.m. civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from previous prosecutors.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had acted jointly, working particulate and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Crime Commissionaria 34 can prove four actions to the thiefs who have traveled specifically to commit crimes to Germany.
They had totally spent over EUR 15.000.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, between the rest of a headstone patch: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not act like this at the first look, but the police are among the "hazardous places" of the city.
Going along the road from the east to the west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly stretched kindergarten and a bioshop.
Someone has sprayed "wearful!" to the fasade of a grey house.
Towards a Lidl, which is also to be cut shortly, is already built: By 2017, there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.
However, articles about this "third district", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferably pictured with burning cars in the last few weeks.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have hired contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has since the beginning of the year repeatedly been proclaimed for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms at the ground floor, the cadderschmiede, had been cleaned with 300 police officers, the police patroled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from joining the house with the number 94.
In the meantime, building workers renovated the rooms in order of the unknown household owners.
On July 13th, a Berlin administrative court decided that the excavation had been illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers departed under the jubilee of sympathisants and inhabitants.
This summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the citizen step in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves later.
A primary school and children's gardens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is particularly generated by police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share concerns about increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing left.
The grave, which the Berlin Innensenator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors seems not to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter, which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.
In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.
While the Mainzer had been cleaned in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga, and partly they are still inhabited today by the people they had been occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: with them residents from DDR times and former houseowners now share their kisses.
This is also noteworthy in the rents that have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly struck facades, which were placed with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to statistics are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes are damages to matters that tend to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a hire house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there is no question of uncertainty.
As regards violence, it is important: the people in 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars have been lost directly in the Rigaer.
For the architecture studied, their road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more from one another than else."
New builders have deliberately moved into the Riga street - and remained.
That is why it was so important to her that the inhabitants get their road back: by the police, politics and media, all suddenly claimed the dignification of the district in July.
But in the eyes of inhabitants like new builders, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former building holes that extrude the old inhabitants.
"These are eventually property apartments that are not interesting for many people here - rather people who are not so well occupied," she says.
"Polition and destruction, I can't be pleased."
But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?
There is frustration on all sides, including at the police and the inhabitants.
For attracted people who are angry with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a gnawl district, there can be bad complaints about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organisation.
In addition, she is a social worker on the ground.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee aid, administration, authorities, and who are still involved.
Regine customer from the working circle suggests that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egging wool milksau, which has a problem in particular.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than rather the number of desirable tasks - had meant targeting than the administration wanted to describe the body.
A administrative professional was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in social work, just a egg-laying wool milksau.
However, administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
The main concern is organisation, work with people on the ground, and also behind the scenes and network activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has spent a 50-percent unit of three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honoring and principal actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon there are new containers in the waterway
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for the transfer of connections.
They must stay refugees in their own or hired living rooms.
The cost of building, renting or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
Responsibilities change from the Board of Country to municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, so Deuschle says, it's not the case that you're dependent on private homes.
Therefore, general housing needs to be erected, as it calls so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the waterway.
But it's not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the label, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
Besides a firm stay, there are practice sites, training agencies, school places, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many work in the building or help house masters, do well-benefit work - and that motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will result in a positive external effect.
It's "no employment therapy."
But activity does not mean work only.
The day needs a fixed structure, says Deusle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of association.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with local and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are strange.
So there are also administrative and honorary officials here.
It should be central that refugees feel that they are desirable and welcome to Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
You have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and that they can overcome time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who ever develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, shouldn't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people who don't have anything to do with". The work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
It's all a "mammo task".
A difficult question: Do they have a fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after recent events?
"No," says Regine's customer very clearly, "what some people may call naive." But a rest risk could and wouldn't want to exclude them.
But the helpers would be aware of it.
These events are also the subject of refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassinators would put them in trial.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, the main and honourable officials on site and in the region must keep an eye on activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new hit of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics are shocking.
Actually, it's unfair to put her helpers on the place.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customers also make it clear that the Urbachers are already exposed to the reasonable integration of the previous people.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Searched inbreakers with helicopters
For about an hour, the police hub screw fled out different areas - unfortunately.
On Friday morning at 8.50 a.m., two unknown men were violently penetrated into an apartment in a multi-family house in Lindenweg.
The inhabitant amazed the two and struck the disaster.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, well masked, both bluejeans and black capuzenpullis.
