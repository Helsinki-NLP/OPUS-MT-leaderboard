“ Looking like a fool ”
Some advisors suggest to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, members of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns are made because of a plan to change the Council's name into the wellness of the Congress.
Consultants of all categories are worried that they may be laughing.
One councilman of the worker group said that his group was worried that “twp and Pwp do have to do with it. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: in Welsh means twp foolish and pwp means wool.
A director of the Plaid Cymru group said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied ” and gave other suggestions to the name.
A chairman of the Welsh Containing Group said that his group had “open mind ” on the change of name, but pointed out that the word MWP and Muppet (floon) were not significantly different.
This context suggests that the well - known w is produced in the same way as you in English.
The Council, who is now working on a lawyer to submit the name changes, said: “The final decision on all the names over the members of the Council will, of course, lie with the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) authorized the Welsh Council to change its name.
In June, the Council published the conclusions of a public survey that proved a great support for calling the Council the Wellness Congress.
The WMP (Welsh Parliament Members, well-known Senators) elected the MWP, but the general public had the greatest support in the surveys.
According to reports, administrators now make suggestions, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the Chairman of the Council, Elin Jones, who should submit the basis for the changes within a few weeks.
The initial reform will also include other changes in the functioning of the Board, including rules on the withdrawal of the Board of Directors and the Committee Organization.
When discussing the initiative begins, directors will be able to pay their final titles.
Macedonian people vote in the elections on the change of their names
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country into "the Republic of Northern Macedonia."
This matter was understood in an attempt to resolve a decades of dispute with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own territory, named Macedonia.
The name of its neighbours in the north has long been claimed to be equivalent to its territory and has repeatedly protested against their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, which is unagreed with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, the supporters of the votes, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have stated that the change in name is simply the price that needs to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The Church Clock of St. Martin’s Silence, Harlem’s Churches
“ The elderly people I have spoken to said that before then there was a bar and a church in each corner, ” said Mr. Adams.
"Today there is no one there."
He said that it would be understandable that the burdens would decline.
"The people have other ways to meet," he said.
“ The children are no longer the centers of the neighborhood where people meet regularly. ”
As regards the churches, he is concerned that the money left from sale will not only be as long as leaders are expected to “and sooner or later they will return to the original place. ”
He added that churches may have been replaced by a apartment house full of people who will not help rescue the next neighbor’s refugees.
“ The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will become white, ” he said, “and therefore will hasten for these churches to be closed forever, for most people who move in these apartments are unlikely to be members of these churches. ”
Both churches were built from white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church decade later.
In the 1930 ’ s, the original white methodist congregation moved away.
A congregation of dark people who had served in the neighborhood took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over St. Martin’s church under the direction of King John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to exclude merchants in 125th streets, Harlem’s main shopping gate, who desired to hire black workers or to give them a position.
In 1939, the building was seriously damaged in fire, but members of sergeant Johnson’s congregation planned to rebuild it, and they also made the watch game.
Sergeant David Johnson, son and afterman of Sergeant Johnson, called the watch game proud “the clock of the poor people. ”
The specialist who played the clock game in July called it another name: “Sume historical instruments. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first watch game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved to a larger clock games in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin hadn't got anybody else in his place.
Last months, many architects and actors have taken their way to St. Martin, some of the leaders of the church, and others from the Bishop region.
The Church Council, who is appointed church leaders, wrote the Bishop in July and declared its concerns that the Bishop “will try to overcome the expense ” of the Church Council, even though it had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and the actors sent by the Bishop.
Some attendants complained about the lack of transparency from the part of the Bishop region.
A shark hurts a 13 - year - old boy who blowed by a cum in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13 - year - old boy and hurt him on Saturday when the boy was diving for a cum in California on the first day of the humar fishing period.
The attack came right before seven o’clock the morning near Beacon’s Beach coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then rushed over along with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an excitement to reach a cum, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was bite!
I was bite!"
All his bone was torn up," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was moved with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is seriously wounded.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
Larry Giles, head of the coastal guard, said at a media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous kind of shark.
Giles added that the victim had severe damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed coastal access from the Ponto Beach coast in Casablad to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and safety.
Giles said that more than 135 different types of sharks are in the area, most of them do not consider dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to take place on the UK market
Sainsbury’s is going to make a struggle with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenham’s with cosmetic stores in a shopping center style and with specialist assistants.
This is a part of the plan for entering the UK cost-based product market, 2,8 billion pounds, increasing as the sales of fashion and household products are decreasing. The larger cost-effects are tested in 11 shops throughout the country and will be set up in more shops in the next year if they work well.
Investment in clothes is part of a large-scale way to use a helicopter that was previously new to TV, microwave ovens, and household products.
Sainsbury’s claims to double its tailor selection in up to 3,000 product species, including trademarks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive increased space with marked areas similar to those found in shops like Boots.
The shop will also start re-sale on its Boutique tailor selection so that the majority of the lips are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test the warehouse in two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Croydon in south London last week and the next will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Network shops and the increased tendency of consumers to buy small amounts of food every day in neighborhood shops means that large markets need more effort to make people come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury, said that the sales would be more and more similar to shopping centres when the shopping chain is trying to fight the Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and goods than food.
Sainsbury's has set Argos camps in hundreds of shops and has also presented the history of many Habitat camps since both chains were bought two years ago; according to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The first attempt of the shop to live up on its clothing and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around 2000, so because of disputes about how to share the sales of drugs in the largest markets ended.
The new policy is followed by Sainsbury’s selling its 281 pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd product sales, for 125 million pounds ago three years ago.
According to the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these programmes by adding a large selection of luxury brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Sainsbury’s market manager, Paul Mills-Hicks, stated: “We have transformed our appearance on our clothing stores to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for employees who will be available for advice.
Our brand selection is designed to satisfy all needs. A fascinating environment and comfortable locations make us an exciting cotton store that transforms old commercial practices."
Peter Jones "indignant" after Holly Willoughby discontinues a 11 million pounds contract
Peter Jones, the star from the Dragons Den, became “sensitive” after Holly Willoughby discontinued a 11 million pounds contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their houseware and accompanying brands, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37 - year - old student in this morning, announced his decision at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the Star of Dragons’ Den, with the painful end, by stopping participation in a popular lifestyle company at the latest to focus on new and profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Reports say that Jones has been “powerful” at a difficult meeting on Thursday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the television woman popularly admitted that she did not have enough time for the Truly homeware and companion brand because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, and was intended to double the property of Willoughby, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that she was going to pull out of Truly, Jones flew from Britain to stay in one of many of her summer homes.
A author reported: “Truly was the longest one on Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future project, which would make it receive for the next two decades.
Her decision to cease came to an entirely open shield.
No one could believe what happened on Thursday, it was so short that the line would be marketed.
There's a full stock of lips in Marlow's headquarters that are ready to go to sale."
Experts believe that the excretion of this morning, among the most popular stars in Britain, can cost the company millions because of large tanks, from pumps and candles to clothes and household goods, and may cause further delays in selling the goods line.
This could also mean the end of long - term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been a friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as chairman in March.
The pairs spend their summer holidays together, and Jones spends 40 percent in Baldwin’s company, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV I'm a Celebrity component manager.
Last night, a author of close Jones said: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Difficult discussions “and then we became in love ”
He was ghosted with the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider unappropriate to the President, and for being so positive to the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Said Trump and simulated the voice of a reporter.
"I haven't given anything left."
He argued that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear weapons in North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions on the detention of nuclear weapons have been stopped.
More than three months after June of Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the principal ambassador of North Korea, said to international leaders at the S.N. General Assembly that the North was not a “appropriate response” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea towards nuclear weapons.
He said that instead, the United States continued to engage in business relations with a view to maintaining pressure.
Trump was more positive in his meeting talk.
“We have a great deal with North Korea, ” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He said that his attempts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in a positive impact - fireworks testing, hostages had been released, and the earthly remnant of American soldiers had been returned home.
He also warned his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“ It is so easy to behave as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a treadful stadium, there were only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing to the people in front of him.
A river and earthquake in Indonesia cause great damage on the island, hundreds have died
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, the international helpers were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to escape their homes, the need for help is not declared.
“ Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organizations, so this is difficult, ” said Ms. Summung.
Although the Save the Children organisation is working together a team to travel to Palu, it is still unlikely for foreign assistants to work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, an advocate of the National Emergency Agency, said that Indonesian administrators appreciated the situation in Palu to see if international associations should be allowed to assist in the assistance work.
In view of the common earthquake in Indonesia, the country is sadly poorly prepared to defend natural forces.
The flood waves have been built in Aceh, which are rarely seen at other coastal lines.
It seems that the loss of flood - waves in Palu has still increased, even though warning has been issued.
Even in the best situation, traveling between the many islands in Indonesia may be a challenge.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A medical ship that has been laying at the port of Lombok to observe that the victims of the earthquake are now on their way to Pala, which will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main elements of his election campaign to refine the degraded roadways of Indonesia, and he has put a lot of money in the way and railways.
However, a shortage of funding has affected Mr. Joko’s control, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to face persistent tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have developed more persistent religious policies.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands had to leave their homes when Christians and Muslims struggled on streets with sweats, bows, arrows, and other basic weapons.

The ball flooded high over the target and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
“I just wanted to try to get into this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“ I saw Kante come and touched once and didn’t think so much about it, but I just took the shot. ”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half game after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in 25 minutes.
In the search, the Chelsea attendant gave the ball with a hill to Mateo Kovacic and then spread from the middle to the play half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made the ball walk quickly between the center.
Then he sent the ball beautifully forward and sent Hazard into the hell.
Hazard ran off the defenses and screwed in the remote corner with a left footboat past Alisson Becker, a targeter of Liverpool.
Liverpool plays in Napoli on Wednesday at the San Paolo stadium in Napoli, Italy, at 15:00 a.m.
Chelsea plays videoton in the UEFA department on Thursday, London.

The Short British Congress of Cromwell is the latest memorial that is accused of “Recover history”
The ban of the statue would be poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban of his persecuted puritan followers on so many cultural and religious things of England.
On the other hand, the Cromwell Society said that Mr. Crick’s suggestion was “smart ” and“ attempt to rewrite the story. ”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion about removing shortages, it was inevitable that the shortage of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be before the battle.
The Angloph of the Civil War against Civil Symbols was neither command nor execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent chart of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a sign of the 19th - century times and is part of the history of a man who many believe still deserve praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century but today, has been the guardian of the Congress against external pressure in his case of the kingdom.
There is still a great historical dispute about the fact that this description is all right.
However, the conflicts in the mid - 17th century may have formed the development of our nation and Cromwell is a well - known person who represents one side of their struggle.
It is worth greeting and remembering his accomplishment as a protector of the kingdom."
Pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him.
The pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on a market in the southwest of China, according to news from the spot.
The man named only with his surname “Yuan” was found dead with broken stroke and covered blood near the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou region, according to news from South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Pigs are preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
According to his uncle, he had traveled from the neighboring district Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that the door into nearby pigs was open.
He said that there had been a large mold inside the stairs with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a trial confirmed that the 250 kg bulb had killed the farmer.
“ My cousin’s feet were bloody and wounded, ” said the cousin, with the surname “Wa”, to the Guiyang Evening News news office.
The recording from a security camera showed Yuan to come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market said to Evening News that the pig had been locked in so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence in the field.
According to news, Yuan’s family and the market owners are discussing improvements for his death.
There are recorded examples of swine attacks, although rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their house in Massachusetts and hurt the man seriously.
Ten years earlier, a welcoming farmer knitted 300 kilograms of pigs on a dragon machine until his wife fell the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba said to CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but that their blood taste can arise aggression.

They'd like to blast and be curious... they wouldn't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show their belonging respect," he said.
The remnant of Rosa’s turbulence brings a great impact on the southwestern part of the United States
As foretold, the strength of the bulb of Rose decreases when it crosses the cooler sea at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring a great result that could cause floods in the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa became a Class 1, with wind strength up to 136 km a hour, at 5 o’clock the morning to the eastern beach time on Sunday, and was located more than 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is estimated that Rosa will go northward on Sunday.
At the same time, it is lowered in the formation of the Pacific and will go eastward to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baia Californian shades on Monday as a tropical storm, it will follow a great tropical rage in the northern direction into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of departure in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical area will be mixed with the nearing layer, forming a large and widespread departure over the southwestern part of the next few days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm of decay may cause hazardous floods, soil movement and possible steps in the desert.
A high tropical rate will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of departure in an hour in some places, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be up to 5 to 10 cm of departure at some places in the southwestern part, especially in most Arizona counties.
There is a potential for sudden floods with rapidly worsening circumstances because of the distribution of tropical rain.
People are strongly advised not to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
A huge rain can turn giles into blowing rivers and thunderstorms.
The closer place will carry local decay in certain areas at the Southern California coastline.
There is a potential of more than 1 cm of departure, which could cause a small movement of soil and throat on the road.
This is the first generation of the area during the rain period.
A number of distributed tropical cows will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before departure spreads over larger areas late on Monday and Thursday.
A great decay will spread over four states on Thursday and will end on Wednesday.
Due to the cooling of the northern archipelago, the tropical temperature is expected in October everywhere in the United States.
Sometimes this can cause high temperature fluctuations over short distances.
On Sunday, there was a very good example of a great variation in the Middle States.
There are nearly 7 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
The next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and disperse.
A large part of the Central and Eastern United States is expected to have a warm start on October with a temperature of around 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeast.
On Thursday, the temperature could rise to 25 degrees in New York City, some 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather forecast indicates that there is a high risk of temperature above the average for the eastern part of the United States in the first part of October.
More than 20 million people watched hearings of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people looked at the exciting witness of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, on Thursday and the witness of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual fraud that should have taken place in the 1990 ’ s.
At the same time, the political patch continued, and television stations interrupted regular schedules to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, Arizona Senator of the Elders, presented an initiative for the FBI to examine the accusations for one week.
Ford told the Senatorial Board of Justice that she was confident that Kavanaugh had caught her drunk and tried to get her off at a school party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional witness, said that he was assured that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people watched the trials than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company measured the average view of the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels that showed the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen is usually in trouble to measure the views of people in offices.
To put this in context, this audience group is similar to the size of football or the Oscar prize celebration.
According to Nielsen, most of those who took the whole day’s hearings watched the Fox News Channel, or 5.69 million, who have loyally supported Kavanaugh’s name.
ABC was second with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS was 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest remained great.
Flake was the center of the game on Friday.
After the office of this Senator of the Republican Republican Group, announced that he would choose Kavanaugh in favour, the CNN and CBS took pictures of when Protestants cried to him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into the elevator to meet the Judgment Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while shortly raining over him in a direct broadcast by CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he is telling the people of the country the truth? ”
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women are powerless. ”
Flake said his office had published an explanation, and before the lift door was closed, he said that he would express himself further at the committee’s meeting.
The Capal and TV stations had all direct broadcasts later when the Judgment Committee decided whether Kavanaugh should be sent to the Elders’ Division.
Flake said he would only do that if the FBI examined the accusations against the appointed one next week, but a minority of democrats has encouraged it.
Flake was partly convinced after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, a Democratic Senator.
After a conversation with Coons and some other Senators, Flake took his decision.
The votes of Flake changed because it was evident that the republics did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized the FBI study of the accusations against Kavanaugh.

Mountains Spray ashes over Mexico City
A ash from the Mount Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention (The National Center for Disaster Prevention) in the United States advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the mountain after the invasion of the invasion and recorded 183 cases of gas and ashes during 24 hours.
The centre was monitored with titring and shaking from the mountain of fire.

Police in Conflicts with Catalonian Separators Right before birthday of Independent Participation
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants responded to disadvantaged police and thousands participated in protests for the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to declare independence.
A group of mask - clothed divorced cops stoned with eggs and poured powder painting that formed dark dust clouds on the streets, which were usually full of travelers.
Conflicts also broke out later the day, and police were using chills to keep battles in progress.
A group of divorced ones cried out: “We do not forget or forgive ” for a few hours while their opponents shouted:“ Long life in Spain. ”
According to the local media, they had to be injured by their protests.
A year after October 1, the national vote was sentenced illegally by the authorities of Madrid, but the Catholic separation was rejoiced.
The majority of the choosers chose independence, but their participation was poor, since most of those who were opposed to separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catholic authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last time when the police tried to stop elections at elections across the territory, which resulted in conflicts.
Independence groups had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests to support the police.
The protest process took place but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68 - year - old electrical operator, participated in the protests of divorce with his wife and said that he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ Previously, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy because of being able to choose, but now we sit fast, ” he said.
Despite the necessity of necessity but little victory in regional elections in December last year, Catalonia’s independence classes have been difficult to keep steam this year, since many of their most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in a warranty of trials due to their role in the organisation of the vote and independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old engineer who took the protest to support the police, said that both states had encouraged the dispute.
“ The tension grows constantly, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalonian leaders who were imprisoned and asked for trials from late last year, to offer himself to the European Congress in the next year.
He said: “My proposal in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return in the field of democratic values and oppression that we have seen the Spanish government use,” he said.

Infectious at the 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
First goal Dolly Menga guaranteed the victory of Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower department, came to Rangers in an open shield, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the happiness and Gary Holt's team is now in another place with Hibernian.
The team Gerrard has not yet worked at the electoral department of this season and plays against Hearts, who are eight points ahead at the top, the next Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna in the European Department on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still unconquered in the department with six victories, and Holt's chief trainer has not yet had to experience loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses the ability to resist bitless guests
Holts should have been over a long time before it took a target, but their bone loss caused Ranger great trouble.
Scott Robinson broke through but hesitated in his attempt to screw, and then Alan Lithgow overshoke after he had run through the defense to receive a scalp from Greig Halkett on the opposite of the target.
The guests left Ranger to play before them in peace, knowing that they could cause the guests trouble at the right places.
And that was how the goal was important.
Rangers got an extra spy, and Livingston worked in creating marketing facilities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in a joint, which accepted a shipment and scorched from the midst of Vitateig.
At that stage, Ranger had ruled the ball, but the defense of the locals was incredible, and Liam Kelly, a target guard had not had to do much effort.
Thus this continued into the second half game, although Alfredo Morelos was able to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, the targetman of Ranger, and Lithgow shot from the target after a visit from Livingston.
Inquiries were constantly encountered in Vitateig Livingston, but were kicked from, and two requirements for the protection of Halkett against Glenn Middleton, and one by hand, were rejected.
"Smart" for Livingston analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Stadium
Excellent performance and finality for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood great and continued to overlook all the expectations on their way up.
Their game style and their teams have hardly changed anything since they came back to the top department, but Holt deserves great commendation for having put the team together from their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, a leader, was enormously good and led a fully organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes all the time.
On the other hand, Ranger lacked inspired.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played much under expectations.
They failed to complete their attendances and only once managed to open the half of the home, so this should be an awake for Rangers, who now sits in the middle of the department.
Erdogan gets mixed receptions in Köln
It was smiled and bright sky on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the two nations.
There has been a dispute between them on issues such as human rights, media freedom and access to Turkey to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open new huge mosques.
The city is the home of most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used safety reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of mosques, but a number of supporters were allowed in her neighborhood to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of Kurds — also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
The two counterparts reflect the dispute of these guests, who is greeted as a hero of some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictatorship ruler of others.

The Fellibyl Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (drying area may benefit)
It is uncommon that the tropical layers are fighting over Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the rest of the turbulent Russia travels over the southwest, with the risk of sudden floods.
The weather office of the country has already issued warnings on a sudden flood for Monday and Thursday in the west of Arizona and the south and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is estimated that Rosa will go directly over Phoenix on Thursday and come late on Monday with departure.
The weather office in Phoenix said on Twitter that only ten turbulents were able to maintain the strength to be classified as tropical storms or lows in shorter than 320 miles [320 km] from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a barbecue of less than 64 km from Arizona border."
The last predictions from the country's base are 5-10 cm of departure, with a unique departure up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwestern part, including the centre of the Rock Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of a unique outcome up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of landing in rapid floods, the result from Rosa may be a blessing because there are great dryness in the area.
Although flooding can cause great harm, some of this result will have a positive effect, which is now dry in the southwestern part.
According to the Dry Surveillance of the United States, at least over 40 percent of Arizona is very dry, which is the next highest class," reports from weather.com.
First, Rosa’s turbulence will reach a country on the Baja Californian coast in Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a mill on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, traveling north at 19 km speed per hour.
The storm crosses the cooler sea in the Pacific, so its power declines.
Thus, he is expected to arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon of Monday or Monday evening.
There is a great potential in some areas of Mexico, with a considerable risk of flooding.
“ It is expected to reach up to 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwestern part of Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 cm of departure,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then hold north of Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach Arizona’s border early on Thursday morning as a tropical landmark, and then continue through Arizona and come to southern Utah late on Thursday evening.
“ The greatest risk expected from Russia or her remnant is a very great descendant in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert area of the United States, ” said the country’s turbulent center.
This result is expected to cause life - threatening floods and land movements in the wilderness, and steps at the end of the mountains.

Trump says that Kavanaugh “wered excited to feel evil and anger ” from the Democratic group
“A vote to support the judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the unbarmhful and absurd methods of the Democratic Group,” said Trump at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling in the West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “wered excited to feel the evil and the wrath ” from the Democratic group.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the assembly on Thursday, where he denied the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusations to the Committee.
On Saturday, the president said that “Americans had seen the talent and the quality and courage of the people ” of Kavanaugh the day.
“A vote to confirm the Kavanaugh judge is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a magnificent CV as a official person,” he said to the group of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s name when he spoke of the importance of supporters of the Republic.
“ There are five weeks in one of the most important choices in our life.
I don't offer myself, but I'm doing it seriously," he said.
“ For this reason I am going around many places to fight for great offerers. ”

The first key vote on the floor of the Elders' Department on Kavanaugh's name should not be made later than Friday, according to the assistant of the officers of the Republic of CNN interviewed.
Hundreds of men died from the earthquake and a flood wave in Indonesia, and likely the number of the dead will rise.
At least 384 died, and many were scraped away when a huge century fell on the coast when a great earthquake and flooding ravaged over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered together at a festival on the coast of Pala, when up to six meters [6 m] of the high centuries at the beach at sunset, scattered a number of people on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The river wave was formed after a earthquake of 7.5 points in Richter.
“ When the flood wave threats were created yesterday, people were still on the coast and did not escape immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Emergency Institute of Disaster, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
“ The river wave didn’t come alone, it drove cars, trees, houses, she swallowed everything on land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the flood wave had traveled over an open sea at 800 miles [800 km] speed before it hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the flood wave and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were moved to the 24 centers of Palu.
Air photographs published by the Emergency Agency showed many devastated buildings and shops, rotated and devastated bridges and mosques surrounded waters.
Afterquakes continued to run over the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was seen in a area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Institute of Food and Technology, in announcement that the energy that released from the emerging of the great trembling on Friday would have been about 200 times greater than the atom bomb that fell to the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographical location at the end of a long and soft flood may have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damages were “important ” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had crashed.
Like some victims, he said that 540 people had been hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the fall and damage to property could be more along the coastline 300 miles [300 km] north of Palu, in the area called Donggala, closer to the recording of the earthquake.
Nowgroho said: “The communication is very low and no information is available from Donggala. ”
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on the way to the locality.
“ This has already become a tragedy, but could be much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The foundation was criticized by many on Saturdays because they did not notice that a flood wave had scattered Palu, although official representatives said that the centuries had arrived within the time of the warning.
In a video published in social media, a person was heard crying from the upper height of buildings to warn the people on the street below about the nearing of a flood wave.
Only minutes later, the flood wave shrinks on the coast and carrys out buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood wave resulted in a loss of electricity that prevented Pala’s communication and made it difficult for the authorities to organise help.
According to the authorities, the army is beginning to send airplanes with aids from Jakarta and other cities, but people who have been helped from the area still need food and other needs.
The city’s airports have only been reopened for assistance and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, President, is going to visit the refugee center in Pala on Sunday.
The number of the dead is over 800 by a flood wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
Workers of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they are looking for refuge in tent cities set up in the garden outside their offices.
“ People said they saw many houses ruined, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Auxiliary groups have started hard helping, but some have complained that abroad helper with high expertise would be obstructed from travelling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, stocks and staff may only begin to come if the accident area is declared to be a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ This is still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
When the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign assistance, but no declaration has yet arrived."
When the second night fell over Pala after the earthquake and the flood wave on Friday, friends and their missing families kept in the hope that their loved one of the miraculous stories that bring hope to the devastating predictions of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was saved out of a boot.
On Sunday, helpers rescued a woman who had been held under ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian spectacular team, had been the trainer of two missing pilots for the Asian play that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked in the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“ As a man with long experience in flushing, I have my own emotional burden to bear, ” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news came within the vision group because the Roa Roa hotel had crashed, he would have sent WhatsApp a message desperately to the contestants who stayed in Pala and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only grey signs, instead of blue.
“ I think that means that the message was not received, ” he said.

Kanye West: The Rapper turns his name into Ye
The Rapper Kanye West is gonna change his name - to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The world that was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of its eighth album that came out in June.
The change is his participation in the Saturday Night Live feature, which is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariöna Grandi, who resigned for “sensitive reasons, ” said the manufacturer of the factors.
West has previously said that this name has a religious significance for him, but it is also a shortening of his current name.
“ I believe that “ye ” (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means“ you, ” said West earlier in the year when he discussed the name on his record with the Big Boy radio manager.
“So I am you, I am we, that are we.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and to just Ye--being just reflecting the good in us, the wicked, the confused, all.
The plate is rather a reflection of who we are."
He is one of many famous reefs who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former co-worker West, has also written his name with and without a string and a highcase.
The elected president of Mexico promises not to use the army against general citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against public citizens, now the country will soon be less than 50 years of birthday of bloody vengeance against students.
On Saturday on the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “never the army would use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot a peaceful protest tour in the square and drowned up to 300 people at a time when the left - minded movements of students were shooting roots throughout Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students monthly strength and opening up more free public university.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational facilities attract young people to criminals.
The United States should double the funding for satellite
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of satellite, the United States should double the funds it takes in research in this field, says the inventor and the satellite user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statements were reported after the various departments of the U.S. Government issued announcements of satellite, even though the United States did not have a formal overall satellite programme.
On the other hand, China reported her plan last year: it refers to the first place in a satellite-defined new creation for 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the amount of satellite research, while all the other countries are so much longer after the United States, and we are waiting for the next large discovery in the field of satellite, ” said Lee.
Double funding could double the chances of the next large discovery of satellite in the United States, said Lee to CNBC this week at a interview.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the director of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has been invested in Face++, one of the main satellite companies in China.
He worked with a satellite system in the 1930s at the Carnegie Mellon University, who won the best player in the United States in Othello, and later he was director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee talked about previous technical contests held by the U.S. authorities, such as the military race of the Defense Department, and asked when the next race would be held, to see the next primary muscles.
In the United States, scientists often have to work hard for the government’s strength, ” said Lee.
“ It is not China that touches the main mind, but the companies, ” said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have advised geniuses from universities to work with satellite skills over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigrant policy could also help the United States to strengthen their satellite studies.
“ I think those who have a doctoral degree in satellite should be automatically allowed to stay, ” he said.
The Chinese Congress issued its future programme in July 2017.
Like the National Science Foundation, China’s Natural Science Institute provides funds for university - working people, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Ministry launched a satellite centre, which is intended to cooperate with both industrial and educational institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee of satellite expertise.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million per year in satellite studies.
At the same time, the American legislation, which was intended to create a satellite safety advice, has not continued for several months.
Macedonian people choose a national vote on whether to change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia chose a national vote on Sunday on whether the name of the country should be changed to the "Region of Northern Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve decades of disputes with Greece, which have closed their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a district named Macedonia and claims that the name of their neighbours in the north is equivalent to the requirements of their sovereignty and therefore refused them to enter NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, which was based on the new name, but nationalist opposers claim that the change will undermine the self - image of the majority of Macedonia’s people of slave origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote fee and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach 50 percent of the minimum necessary to ensure that the vote fee is valid.
The question of the election note is so sounding: “Will you go to Nato and the European Union by accepting the agreement with Greece? ”
The supporters of the change in names, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that this is a reasonable fee for Macedonia to be part of associations such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Though the conclusion is not legally binding, enough delegates have said that they will apply it and bind it into law.
The change of name would need two thirds of the Congress.
The council committee said that no unusual report had been made at 1 p.m. after noon.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of participation in the last elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the vote was voted.
“I came to choose for my children, our place in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old choosing in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave its vote in the Macedonian national vote on whether to change the country's name, which would pay the way into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Congress, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked on preparing a small area and setting up chairs in front of tents built by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are gentle Nathan and the European Union, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the door of service," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have glory.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO will transfer the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the proportion of unemployed is over 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the nationals are dependent on the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after paying her vote.
He said that consent would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A monthly survey published by the Macedonian Police Research Agency showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the Electoral Participants would participate in the national vote, which is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV shows that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of them 70 percent said they would say yes.
In order to make the national vote valid, the meeting must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not accepted, it could mean the first serious shock for the Western government’s policy since its adoption in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, a player of Manchester City, goes through all the defense Brighton and scouts
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the Brighton defeat of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his target in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian leader received a sending in the middle of the field at the beginning of the trial.
He scattered over three defenses Brighton and then went out to the open field.
Then Aguero became surrounded by four green - clothed defenders.
He passed by a defenseman, and then he ran away from a few more than a vitateig Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English professor used the first touch within the Vita Eye to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play Mathew Ryan, the targeter Brighton, with a shot at the right side of the target.
“ Aguero is in some footing matters, ” said CEO of City, Pep Guardiola, to newspapers.
“ We talked that he was playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky that he took a target at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the excellent game.
That target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a shipping far inside the field half of Brighton in that process.
He sent a beautiful long ball on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling toward the pitch.
The promoter of City sent the ball to the net just before it ran out.
City plays a meeting with Hopenheim in the Master Department at 12:55 p.m. on Thursday at the Rhein-Necker stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a rocky game
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing at the end, there was no great reason to force another start.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a chance to get to the end, but they have the same game forehead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division.
Rockies received at least a "wildcard" seat with their 5-2 victories on Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still trying to reach their first section article.
“ Even though we play free, we can at least play for the electrical atmosphere in Denver, as well as for the people who meet surely will be playing their best game this year.
Why should I not want to compete in such a situation?"
Nationals will still report who will be the first caster in the game of Sunday, but they are supposed to have Scherzer thrown in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting at the 34th time, took a training cycle on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, a normal Sabbath with him.
This right-handed caster in Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 windslashes in 220 2/3 cycles in this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the case around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge, when he talked about the importance of the supporters of the Republic involved in the mid - time trials.
“ Everything is in danger in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important choices in our life.
It's one of the big, big, I don't offer, but do it, so I'm going around all the places to fight for great providers," he said.
Trump continued: “Man sees this horrible, rotary group of democrats, you can see it happen now.
And they are determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they need to go over to gain power and rule, they just want to have authority and control, we don't give them it.
He said that the Democrats were working on “sustaining and stopping. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, “the Democrats are angry and evil and cruel and unfair. ”
He named the Senator Dianne Feinstein, the president of the Senatorial Committee, and was answered by the audiences.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who left the document?
Hey, what?
No, no, I was waiting for one... it was really a bad exercise, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer a tolerant church.
He does not tolerate those expressing his mind
When the actors of the moments in my group chose to give me an appeal, it was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of many senators of the working group who have been told that we are not welcome, just by expressing our minds.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment because she protested hardly against Jewish prejudices.
In my case, it was because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The substances were important to have a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, irony-like matters and Jeremy disagreed with the former leaders.
On Friday, the Nottingham East meeting reported that “we want the meetings not to understand and be successful. ”
In my eight - year career as a member of the worker group, the Friday meetings have been the most frequently.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “milder and better ” politics has been forgotten if it ever started.
It has been made more and more evident that different views have not been taken into account in the Worker class and that all opinions are judged according to whether the leaders of the group consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when coworkers, which I thought had similar political views as I, began to expect me to take complete reconversion and support the opinions I had never agreed before, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and I don't care what I say - it follows the tricky abhorrence of social media, called after my withdrawal, denied central government and told me I should not be in the Worker's group.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know I'm more lucky than some of my employees, since most of my comments are usually political.
I admire the professionality and the confirmation of those who have to endure the holiness of sexual or prejudiceful offenders every day but never return.
One of the most disappointed things in this political period is how attacks and offenses have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Group should keep a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a tolerant church, and with any unfaithful regulation or change in choices, the group becomes increasingly tightened.
I've been given many advice for the last two years to bear little, not too high, and then I'll be “righteous. ”
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Workers’ Group as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, who left my school room down, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city government or in a congress.
I've never hidden my political views, nor at the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy and where I disagree with the current leaders.
With those who supported the suggestion on Friday, I would just like to say that when the country travels to Brexit, which will damage homes, businesses, and public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leaders of the Workers’ Group.
But my only message I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Momentar, but to those within my coordination, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am serving you with pride and I promise that no threats to disfellowshipping or political disfellowshipping will disregard me from doing what I think is for the best benefit of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr’s unconquered team goes to the top
Two late touch limits may have shaken the final findings something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory in this acute game of the day in the Tentent's Premiership Department.
They are now in the top seat of the list and one in ten, which are still indefeated.
Eventually, their stronger defense and better use of apparatus made homemen more victorious, and Peter Murchie, a trainer, had the full right to be happy.
“ We have had severe opposition in our games up to now and are still unconquered, so I must be happy, ” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “They deserve commendation, they used their chances better than we.”
Mark Grant Anderson passed Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned on, but a yellow card on the Scottish leader, which was allowed to play the game with Warriors, made Melrose able to allow the numbers to speak, and Jason Baggot reached a touch target.
Climo increased with the leadership of Ayr with a hell before he scouted with a kick right before a half game and then touched the target, and Ayr got over 17-5 in a half game.
But Melrose began the second half of the game with power and touched Patrick Anderson’s target, after Baggot’s search, decreased the target to five points.
After that, Ayr continued to increase his leadership with a contact target from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned on.
Blair Macpherson, the leader of Ayr, then received the yellow card, and Melrose again benefited from being over a man with a contact point from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard visit.
However, homemen came strongly back and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for achieving Climo without a ball, MacPherson swept the touch target behind the Ayr cycle, after an extra squirrrel.
Climo turned the search back, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe reached kick David Amrstrong from the hell, and sent to Gregor Henry, who inspected the fifth touch point of the team.
Star Set Game features ready for a new career in the restaurant
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game features, seems ready to move to a restaurant excursion after he was appointed director of the restaurant company.
Kieran, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC parts popular, which he writes and plays together with his old companion from the fun bar, Creg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the future nineth series will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan has planned for life by Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Operation Morn Limited.
The player didn't want to say anything about the news, but a historian Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be a participant in the “living restaurants” of Glasgow City.
“ The sea is ours: the coastless country of Bolivia hopes that a court will open the way back to the Pacific
The sailors are guarding the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flags.
Flow stations from the Titicaca water to the Amazon year are marked as the stroke: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
Throughout all the land - luxury Bolivia, the remembrance of the coastal line that lost to Chile in bloody battles in the 19th century is still in the fresh memory, along with the desire to resurrect the Pacific.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is deciding from the International Court of Justice in the Hague on October 1, after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has the power, the unified spirit, and the peripheral loss, and, of course, waits for the decision with a positive mind, ” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many inhabitants of Bolivia will observe the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in the Hague will decide Bolivia in the interests of Chile’s obligation to give Bolivia access, after decades of difficult conversation.
The decision on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian families, who will have a controversial fight for re-evaluation in the next year.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late August.
However, some analysts suspect that the Court of Justice decreed Bolivia in favour, and that if he did so, it would not change.
The Court of Justice, who has a headquarters in the Netherlands, has no authority to give a country from Sile, and has decided that the decision will not affect the conclusion of possible discussions.
The fact that the court’s decision comes only six months after the final talks, indicates that the matter “has not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a silent international law expert.
In the last four years, it is also possible that Bolivia has not been a matter of promotion, but has caused the country to return.
“ The current Bolivian government has stolen the matter of access to the sea, ” said Zharate.
Morale's speech has declined all favor from Sile, she thought.
Bolivia and Sile will continue to talk at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not switched to ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “a unique opportunity to open up for a new relationship with Sile ” and the opportunity to“ end a dispute that is nearly 139 years back in time, both countries to benefit, ” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, was to use this issue as a political curtain.
“ Bolivia will never surrender its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
“ The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past. ”
North Korea says there's nothing going on with nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Foreign Minister of North Korea, says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri held his talk on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His comments are coming now, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister, seems to be on the start of discussions again about nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says that it is “traumourous ” to think that the continuing business bonds and oppositions of the United States against announcement of the end of the Korean war will ever kneel north Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes a clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are great doubts about the seriousness of Pyongyang taking down weapons that the country probably considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris German shows present the latest line of large headwear that will come into fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you do not need to search further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed many kinds of fantastic hats in the oversize of their SS19 line in the fashion area, which attracted the fashion week in Paris.
The number of images of very unhandy hates have been published on Instagram in summer, and these designers have shown their recent creations in fashion.
Valentino’s main work was a large light - brown hat with wide burdens similar to the feathers and hiding the heads of the motels.
Of other supersize components, water melons could see jewelry set, seedweight, and even ananas, but these items are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced many kinds of strange masks, precisely at the right time for a horror wake.
Many of the colorful masks had lips and were rather like Hannibal Lecter than High - German.
One mask looked like a nailing device with a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others looked like smelting ice in bread form.
If you want to pay a toll in the bitch, you're lucky.
German experts foretell that the big hats could soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come to the hammer of La Bomba, a strain hat with over 60cm large burdens that have practiced the head from Rihana to Emily Ratajkowski.
The mark on the back of the very unhandy hat that was seen in all social media was inspired to another large feature that appeared in the fashion area — a beach bag from the throat that was almost as large as the swimming - clothed motel that weared it.
The orbital chassis, with the loads and white leather handles, was the main part of La Riviera SS10 fataline Jacquemus on the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, a stylist of the famous people, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in the fashion for the next summer - since the designer has caused such a great influence should be difficult to ignore demands for supersize components. ”
John Edward: The Requirement for World Citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding success of their students and have continued in 2018 with new, brilliant tests that are still strengthened by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further further study, the career they have chosen, and their position as a world citizen.
As a teacher who can set together and teach for specialized study documents, we see that new things continue to be popular at schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it touches his heart."
This is a vital reminder that we cannot simply trust in English to build up relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The test results of this year show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who receive tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received the good rating A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the quality A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received the A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary qualifications for children and young people will certainly need to be in the future.
Currently, languages as a selection are placed in the same place as science - related study materials (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 review by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons which employers argued that jobs were difficult, 17 per cent was because of the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly important in preparing young people for their future activities.
Now that more and more jobs require skills in languages, this ability is necessary in the world of earth.
No matter what jobs people choose, if they learn a different language, they will have a real priority in the future, but it is a knowledge that ends their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multiweighted person a lead to the competitions.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two characters of percentages, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children today to invest immediately in language learning.
Multitudes, especially in new marketing countries, will give children a better chance to find important jobs.
In Scotland, schools differ from languages they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on more classic new things, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for Britain when viewed up to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest is, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scotland’s private schools are obliged to offer a study environment that will prepare and prepare children with the skills they need to achieve, no matter what the future means.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a natural business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
Actually, modern - day language should be viewed as “international skills in communication. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and superiority for the young people of Scotland.
I'll get the bees fair.

LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait will soon end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Luke Walton, Laker’s trainer, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of the season at the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined in how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than a minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on Lakers official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked out in his plans for six plays of Laker’s program before the beginning of the season.
“ During this period of my process, I don’t have to play games before the stage to prepare me, ” he said.
Timelines for the Trump election meeting in Western Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of election meetings and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at friends' places, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote for confirming his choice of the new Supreme Judge has been suspended, Trump is aimed at building up support for the next mid-term elections, because the Republicans are in danger of losing control over the House when votes are paid in November.
What time is the Trump election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7:00 a.m. to the eastern beach time tonight, Saturday 29 September, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through a direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak the case of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge, where tensions existed due to the accusations of sexual assurance.
But the main goals of Trump's meetings are to help the reputations to get better, but they are waiting for difficult elections in November.
According to Reuters’ reports, Trump’s election campaign, these five meetings that will be held next week were designed to “fill volunteers and supporters with zeal when the Republicans try to protect and increase the majority of them in the elderly department and at the congress. ”
“The President’s plan is so necessary for the administration of the House that he will travel to as many nations as it is possible now when the second military period begins,” said a unnamed spokesman of Trump’s election campaign at Reuter’s newsroom.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco stadium in Wheeling and it is expected that supporters will come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that the media from Pittsburgh will tell him,” according to the West Virginia Metro News news office.
The meeting on Saturday will be another visit of Trump to West Virginia this month, but he won with over 40 percent in this county in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the representative of the Republic of West Virginia, to the elderly department, but he's at the bottom of the surveys.
“ It is not good for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuter’s newsroom.
Ryder Cup 2018: The United States shows a willingness to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided circles, the fourth, which was afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what needed in this rivalry about the Ryder cup.
Swinging to success is a sports idea that has been invented and in which the players truly believe, and never more than in the race as this.
Where would they say that the success would fall now?
“ They had six stages ahead, and now it is four points, so the success is rather on our side now, I guess, ” said Jordan Spieth when he started in the contest of the day.
Of course, Europe has the forehead, four stages ahead, with twelve more.
The Americans, as Spieth said, believe that they have a little wind in the sails, and they can be hoped for many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points of four.
Spieth has played a great deal of distinguishing to flat and guided by his example.
After he and Thomas had been two stages below, he set down an important put to keep all the four stages in the game.
His put, who guaranteed them the victory in the 15th Hole, received similar shouts of joy, crying of the kind that tells you that the American team still believes that it has a victory hope.
“ You just have to dive deeply and think about your own game, ” said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players can now.
18 holes to win points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of Ryder.
This weird, but thrilling European couple has won four games of four and can’t do anything wrong.
The “Moliwood ” was the only couple who received a bad afternoon on Saturday, but they also managed to avoid collars on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday, and at the nine holes on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seems to flourish both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the couple to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team but Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun is sitting over the Le Golf National.
The best way is to both do so at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson took easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
In the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swede buried into a hole that they never reached to crack up.
But Sunday no one can help you out of your hole.
The four balls and the four games are so exciting to watch closely because of the interconnection between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how the play plan can change in one point.
Europe has played better than this, and has a considerable lead for the last day, but this four - century slot also showed that the American team has the will of fighting that some had doubted, especially other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 leadership before the final day of the race about the Ryder cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder cup after the four-cules and four-folds of Saturday, with a forehead of 10-6 to the United States.
The Starbuilding Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, which had problems, and have received four points in the Le Golf National Field.
The European team of Thomas Bjørn, who would like to recover the prize cup, which it lost in the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority to the Americans in the four - collar game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance during the four - century years and won two games, but did not get to work up the score.
Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European new team who works four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Melliwood ” after a marvelous weekend, are only another couple who work four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder cup.
After victory of Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-cut game, they showed a great team brain and won the downside Woods and the US-new Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliant gifts occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the four-cut game of the morning, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson in the fourth games, and they worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kupka - who are in the first and third seat on the list of the best golfers of the world.
Europe, however, did not really benefit from this mild and ghosty day southwest of Paris.
A threefold victor in the Gulf Battle, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They worked with difficulties 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball games and later came back and won Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four-games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder cup’s history that a team has worked up four stages will at the beginning of a individual race, although Furyk’s team would only need an equal point to continue the cup.
However, after the next two days, they seem to be overwhelmed by a contradictory attack on Sunday.
Northern Korea says unilateral disarmament "impossible" without trust
On Saturday, the Federal Foreign Minister of North Korea said that on Saturday, the continuing business bonds were only on their deficiency in the United States and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho at the Annual General Assembly S.E. said that North Korea had taken “a considerable action to show favourability” over the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and nuclear tests, decommissioning the nuclear testing area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ On the other hand, we have not seen any corresponding reactions from the United States, ” he said.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty of the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons solely first. ”
Although Ri repeated the familiar North Korean complaints on the resistance of Washington to a “graduate” approach to nuclear weapons where North Korea would be rewarded for every step that it took, his declaration seemed special in the sense that he did not deny unilateral nuclear weapons purely as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to the joint declarations of Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the North Korean leaders, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on the "core nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a solution to bind a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted appeals to relax a strict business ban against North Korea.
“ The United States demands that ‘ nuclear weapons are first to occur’ and increase pressure by using business belts to achieve their own, even protesting against the declaration of ending the war, ” said Ri.
“ There are only dreams of people who don’t know anything about us to think that business bonds can make us knee.
But the problem is that continuing business relations increase our lack of confidence."
Ri didn’t mention the plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, of which the leader of the United States talked about at the U.S. early this week.
Instead of talking about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea in the last five months, he added: “If the member of this nuclear weapon case was South Korea instead of the United States, it would not be this patch in the case of nuclear weapons on the Korean coast.”
Despite this, the tone in Ri’s speech was very different in his previous speech when he said at the General Assembly that it would be unavoidable to direct missiles from North Korea to the mainland of the United States after “the Devil’s President ” Trump called Kim“ Fireflyman ” for suicide.
In the previous year, Trump threatened to “destruct ” North Korea, but this year he proclaimed Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that there was still a lot of work left and that business bonds would have to be valid until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable on this matter, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the Security Council S.I. should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On Thursday, however, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Foreign Minister at the Security Council of the United States, said: “The Security Council’s intermediaries must continue to validate until the complete nuclear weapons have taken place and it has confirmed. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase business bonds with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close funding for the Pyongyang nuclear plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the SD General Assembly and said afterward that he would visit Pyongyang again for the next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for making “crimeful requirements. ”
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to take down the railroads and nuclear stations if the United States took “according operations. ”
He said that Kim had said that the “corresponding actions ” he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and operations towards normal relationships with Washington.
Harvard Students Suspending Study
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night by using caffeine tablets.
Investigation revealed that students at the best university in the world often know little or nothing about the basic principles of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor in sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believed that it saw the first species in the United States.
He received the idea of conducting the course after reading about the impact of sleep shortages on the school.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why is this told me first now, in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said at Telegraph.
The first time of a year, the study explains to students the basic elements of how good sleeping practices help to attain to sports and even contribute to the general well - being.
Paul Barreira, a professor in psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School, and director of the School of Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were very sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour of length and includes various interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of the home room, where students click on coffee, window tents, sportshoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance can worsen with a lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good routine for sleep.
Other parts tell the participants how the long - term lack of sleep may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we feel that they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that welcomes those who are watching and learning the whole night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortages were growing problems.
The assurance of having enough sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” of students to protect stress, tiredness, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fatting, for sleep shortages increase the brain’s call for food so that the body is hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student in chemical and physical biology from California, helped professor Czeisler to put together the course, one of the professor’s cows in the first year of Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all the students at school.
He hopes that the next step will have to ask all masters to finish a similar course before they start college.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up a wake clock that reminds them to go to sleep, and to raise them, and consider the harmful effects from blue light that electric screens and LED lights give off, but it can confuse the inner clock of the body and cause trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers still had problems with the outermost. Stevens Gerrard's division team had to accept 1-0 losses of Livingston, after the target from Dolly Menga.
The team of Ibrox wanted to achieve its first victory at the end of his victory on St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt only gave Gerrard his second loss in his 18 games as director. The team is now eight points after Hearts, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership department.
Infected seven minutes before a half game, and Rangers’ team seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to recover.
Rangers are now falling into the sixth seat, but Livingston goes up to the third, and is only after Hibernian in the difference of targets.
Rangers could suffer further difficulties after the liner Calum Spence had to receive a head injury after some part was thrown into him from the half of the guests’ field.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that wiped Ayr away and ended up in the Betfred cup.
Holt, however, remained at the same Life 11 - setup that reached the step of Heart last week, and he would have been pleased with how well - trained his educated servants overwhelmed the opposition.
Rangers may have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it reached.
They should have scrutinized only two minutes after the start when the first sending from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors, but he shot over.
A long extra slope from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defense companion, shot over the pitch.
Rangers regained the game again but seemed to live in hope rather than belief in his game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales surely felt he should have had a hell when a fourth of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Columbian call.
Rangers could only take two shots in the first half of the game, but Liam Kelly, former targeter Ibrox, did not have much to defend the skull from Lassana Coulibaly and the easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi in the 34th minute had come despite the superiority of the other team, no one can deny that they deserved it, but only because of their endurance.
Rangers failed to do something again from Jacob's long extra.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his calm and empowered to send to Menga, which then was easy to test.
Gerrard took his half-game advice and sent Ryan Kent into the place of Coulibaly and the switch had effect near the moment the back guard arrived in Morelos, but Kelly quickly responded and ran forward to close the shot.
However, Livingston continued to narrow the guests to play the kind of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long transmission to one another.
The team of Holts could have increased its leadership on the finals, but McGregor was well able to deny Jacobs the opportunity before Lithgow ran to the point from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the deputy of Ranger, wanted another hell when he and Jacobs fell together, but Thomson rejected it again.
Almanak: The man who invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a magazine page from our general “Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and FRAM... this is the day that future scientist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans ” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of studying and measuring radioactivity, and the invention eventually led to a device called Geiger measurement.
Since then, the Geiger recorder has received a permanent seat in the science world, but was also popular in the pop population, for example in the 1950 “Bells of Coronado ” movie, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in different roles as scientists:
Man, “What in the hell is this? ”
Rogers: “This is the Geiger measurement, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put on these hearing tools, you can hear the effects of the atoms due to radioactivity in the stones."
Evans: “It really breaks now! ”
“ His ” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63 - year birthday.
But the invention that brings his name continues to live.
A new vaccine against cancer may cause the immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can cause the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know dangerous cells as part of treatment
Treatment includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Then they can “seen” proteins that are common in many cancer cells and then be injected back to the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months, the vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method includes removing immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “seen” proteins called HER2 and appear in many types of cancer, and then the cells are injected back to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that the vaccine is very successful. ”
HER2 “senses various forms of cancer to stop growing, including breast, ovaries, lungs, and pulmonary tumours, ” said Professor Berzofsky.
Similar method of removal of immune cells from patients and the “training” of cancer cells has been active during the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long talk for Trump’s support and wore MAGA’s house after appearing in the TV - show SNL.
It didn't end well
On Kanye West, in the Study in Saturday Night Live, a long - term talk was built, commending President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he would offer himself to the President in 2020.
After having moved the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore Make America Great Derhufu, he spoke long against democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“ I have spoken so often to white people who say, “How do you like Trump, he is a race hater? ”
If I were worried about racial hatred, I would have been moved from the United States for a long time, ” he said.
SNL started the part with a panel where the Hollywood Star Matt Damon made a joke for Brett Kavanaugh’s witness to the Elders Committee because of Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations of sexual intimidation.
Although the long - term West was not sent out, the recording of it was placed on a social media of Chris Rock, a witchman.
I don't know if Rock wanted to make a joke to the West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audiences that he had received bad receptions because of his choosing.
“ I was putting into a backstage.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the scene with this derhue. ”
They put me in treasuring!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Will you see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his super - heroic coat “why that means that you can’t order me to do things, do you want the world to make progress?
Try love."
According to Variety, at least two of the audiences, his comments were held, and the actors of SNL seemed as ashamed, and one attendant said to the newspaper: “There was a stone silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to take the part instead of the songmaid Ariöna Grande, who had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, chairman of the TPUSA group, who said on Twitter: “To one of the courageousest souls: TAKE TO SHEE MONTHS. ”
But the chat star Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply “he himself, and it’s really wonderful. ”
“But I DO NOT choose to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list ”) who I find supporting and spreading ideas that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are, too," she added.
Before the show, the companion on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that now he was “the person who was formerly known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change the name and foot in the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the words of Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the Star of the Queens, criticizes poisonous male
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the violent adventures from the HBO, the Queen Games.
On the other hand, the 31 - year - old player has criticized the status of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen often means that young boys feel that they need to be hard of themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that “something went wrong ” and wondered how to deal with the problem of poisoned male manhood in the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his companion of the Queen Games, the 31 - year - old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “ strong views ” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally, I feel at the moment - what's wrong with maleness?"
“ What have we taught men in their growth, about the problems we see now? ”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in poisonous manhood, because of a very male person on television.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is teaching?
What is taught on television and on streets that make young boys feel like they have to be made by a man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of the contemporary - how do we do this?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
He also acknowledged at the interview that he would not play in any other Chronicle Acts after the next summer, and said that he had received “a lot of battlefields and horses. ”
From November, Kit will play in the reconstruction of True West, a picture by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film manufacturer and his brother who is a robber.
The player recently said that the best thing to have played in the Queen Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these aspects, so that they gave me somehow my future family and my life thereafter, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a loved Jon Snow that Kit played in these emmy price shows.
The couple married in June 2018, in the land of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/Deprecation: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of nationals infected with the HIV virus or with AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 8200,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A large majority of new infections struck with sex, which is a change from the previous.
Previously, HIV was rapidly spread in some parts of China due to the administration of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of those infected with the HIV virus has fallen down to almost the zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a Yunnan district conference.
However, the number of HIV virus infected or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infected by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a great difference between LGBT people.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men are eventually married to a woman.
Many are contaminated because of inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised access to HIV drugs as part of the plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from the Senatorial Senatorials of the Republic, criticizing “hazardous liars” and“ conspiracy teachings”
On Saturday, MEP Maxine Waters refused the accusations that one of her employees had published personal information to three Senatorial Senators of the Republican Group on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that these claims came from “superrightened ” extremists and websites.
“ Liars, liars, and more awful lies, ” said Waters in a Twitter declaration.
The information published contained, according to addresses and phone numbers of the American Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday, from a unknown party in Capitol Hill, during the hearing of the Board of Cavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, because of the accusations of sex.
The game came once after the three Senatorial Assembly had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative pages such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP data identified by the author of the information have been linked to the Waters office and published information about one of her employees, according to Capitol Hill information.
“ This unreasonable accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie, ” continued Waters.
“ My employee — every personal information and safety is now at risk because of these wrong accusations — is not in any way responsible for this information lease.
This unreasonable accusation is absolutely wrong and pure lie."
Water’s statement was quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House reporter.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Fleischer.
“ It indicates that she has no temper for sitting at a congress.
When a person is accused of reasonlessness, he must not react with anger.
We cannot show opposition.
It must not be questioned on the grounds of the accusation.
There must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who said that the critics seemed too angry with the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the volunteer reputations against Waters in the mid - era, also stated his view on Twitter.
“ If it is true, ” he tied.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “added appropriate authorities and lawyers to inform of these false claims.
“ We will make sure that the guilty will be found, ” she continued, “and that they will be charged for all the works that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees. ”
Movie criticism for Johnny English Strikes again - spectacular image with Rowan Atkinson proves low
It's now used to look for Brexit's references in all new pictures where Britain's history, and it seems to be true in this resurrection in the Johnny English series - which began in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just awakened to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this canyon satira tell us how disgusting we are new export devices for the country?
Whether it is or not, Johnny English has received a second renewed permission to crush everything - his name shows above all that he is a creation designed for a show in other than English - speaking countries.
Of course, he is the wise Secret Serviceer who seems to have exciting personalities but is a little mixture of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little deleted by the man who played one note for the Chariots of Fire at the opening celebration of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious world citizen that Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements, where he distinguished everything.
There's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking into a helicopter dressed in a medieval coat, and the helicopter leafs swallowed into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his funny ability, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now, “severe” movies such as James Bond and Mission Impossible pictures also offer a joke.
The joke seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and I felt the adventures that Johnny English had had not been as ideaal as focused as the silly jokes of Atkinson in Mr. Beans.
The constant need for the picture is now that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer hacker has been able to break into Britain's secret spynet and have discovered the identity of all British scouts, for a great deal of amazement for the spy who is on the guard, but there, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon is in too little role.
This is the final struggle for the Prime Minister, who is proud and controversial to a person, and when in a lot of disturbance due to huge political enmity: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a person to remind Theresu May, but the manuscript is not on many fish for her.
Her counselors tell her that all active scouts are in danger and that she must find someone who had been sitting in a sacred stone.
And there Johnny English himself comes to the story, now a school manager in some fine school, but also provides secret instruction in how to be an inspector: here are some funny jokes offering English to a spy school that reminds us of the image School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting, and there meets Bough, his former long - tired partner, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in the energetic role when Vicki Pepperdine doesn't completely let her light shine.
The spion’s soak, which cracks everything in her Majesty’s service, is now back in the yard and meets Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the presidency minister is devoted to the magic of the fantastic billionaires in the technology industry, which claims to be able to resolve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their shake-ups: they turn on in fine French restaurant chocolates as servants, they cause badness when they smuggle themselves in Volta's luxury pocket, and English turns everything on the back when he trys to use the visual glasses to explore the inside of Volta's house.
There is nothing to save in this final point, but even though the picture is featuring and energyful, there is a number of children in it as a whole.
Medium good substance.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't be able to think: Can British movie industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talents?
The employee group refuses to make a four - day work week plan for Britain, with the same wages as five days ago.
The workforce, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow Britain to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the group, supervisors want to make use of savings generated from the revolution to satellite, and to benefit employees by receiving one extra day.
In that case, employees could spend three days of a long weekend, without lowering their wages.
Authorities say that the idea would “pass up” to the group’s economic programme and its policy of improving the businesses’ interests.
The Trades Union Congress Organisation has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, which led workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A member of the Upper Department of Workers said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be reported before the end of the year.
“The change will not take place in one night, but four days of work is an objective that is suitable for the approach of the group to change the economy to the benefit of the workforce and to the total industrial policy of the group.”
The working group would not be the first group to support this idea, but the green group promised four days of work in its election campaign in 2017.
The goal, however, is not supported by the working group as a whole.
A spokesman of the Labour Group said: “Four days of working weeks are not on the group’s newspaper, and the group is not considering to introduce it. ”
John McDonnell, the Ministry of the Shadow Ministry, used the Labour Group's conference last week to describe its ideas of social revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to recover from "unknown leaders" and "growth collectors" from a host company.
The shadow minister's estimates also mean that the current shareholders in water firms may not get all their share back, since the Government of the Worker Group could impose a “advantage” due to malicious infringements.
He has also confirmed the plans to put workforces into management committees and to create a shared property fund to allow 10% of the private businesses to their employees who could receive 500 pounds of their earnings annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" if the FBI study in Kavanaugh could make them change their views.
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against the Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a weekly delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Judge, and raises the question of whether its conclusions might cause the Senatorial Senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter in the “60 minutes ” series of republics and the Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something that would make them change.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“ I mean, of course, ” said Kennedy.
“ When the trial began, I said that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After the accusations were made, I called him and asked, “Do you do this? ”
He was determined, stable, inconsistent."
On the other hand, Graham’s vote seems unchangeable.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to be an incredible accusation to change it, ” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I know: Brett was firmly denying it," added Graham and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And everyone she named couldn’t confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new will change."
What is the international Civil Festival, and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The International Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York, a yearly musical event in which a series of great stars will appear and with similar influences; the end of poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the International Civic Festival, and tens of thousands of people will flee to Central Park, not only to listen to musical items from Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end the sorrow of poverty before 2030.
The first international Civil Festival, held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project (Global Poverty Project), an international feast that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of fighters.
To obtain the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP notes), music guests had to complete various tasks, or “operations”, such as working voluntary work, sending emails to some of the world's leaders, calling phones, or using other valid ways to help bring attention to their goal of bringing an end to poverty.
But how much has the celebration achieved, now being a 12 - year - old goal?
Is the idea of prizeing people with free music really a way to convince people of calling for action, or is this just one so - called “small operation” - because people think they do something important by signing a list of requirements on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “operations ” from its supporters, to call for many different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to declare obligations and policies equivalent to $35 billion, which will affect more than 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group summed up 390 obligations and notifications due to its operations, including investments or collecting at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funding gathered to date has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main obligations comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company investor and manager in Britain, who is working to “help children enjoy their own fullness”, and promised to grant $35 million to Rwanda to help bring an end to malnutrition in the country, after having received 4700 messages from Global Citizens on Twitter.
“With the support of the British Government, forces, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustice of the past,” said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition, to the audiences of plays in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 calls were sent to Britain to add food to mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach up to 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of common questions on the group’s website, one question sounds: “Why do you think you can end the end of poorness? ”
Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult task — sometimes we will be failing constantly.
But, we will reach our limits, just as movements fought for the rights of the civilian and the degradation of race separation before us, for we are stronger together.
Among the events this year are Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York, and the presentations are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the marine as a “restriction” to prevent the export of energy from Russia, says the Minister of the Interior
“ If necessary,” Washington may use the maritime army to prevent energy from reaching the market in Russia, including in the Middle East, ” says Ryan Zinke, United States Interior Minister, according to a report from Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country works in the form of the legal government there, would be a proposal to explore new markets.
“I believe that the reason for their beings in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he should have said according to sources.
And, according to a public notification, there are ways and methods to counteract it.
“ The United States can use the maritime army to ensure that seaways are open and to create obstacles, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not get into the market, ” he said.
Zinke spoke to a visitor’s meeting in the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group called “the voice of the energy emission dance ” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and told her to be more or less the same.
“ The Irish and Russian economic option is increasingly less and less profitable of energy gifts and to replace them with others, ” he said Russia has only one card in the memory of economics dependent on petroleum fuel.
The statements result from the fact that Trump's governance wants to increase its export to Europe of gas and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
In order to do this, officials in the control of Trumps, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to force Germany to discontinue participation in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 mission to place a new energy channel, which Trump says would “catch” Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of North Stream 2 energy, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion miles [110 billion m], is only an economic project.
Russians say that the strong opposition of Washington against the project is simply driven on for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe that energy should not be a tool to use pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the belts, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Minister for Energy, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the task.
The German Industrial Association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to dispense from the EU's energy policy and the two-side agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I’m very unpleasant to the fact that outsider states are divided from our energy team,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, the author of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will “considerate seriously” to offer itself to the presidential office in 2020, she says.
On Saturday, Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusett’s Senator, said that she would “considerate seriously ” to offer herself to the president after the mid - century elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering herself a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It is time for women to go to Washington and manage our government, and then a woman also needs to be a leader, ” she said in a report from The Hill.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider offering myself to the President’s office.”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting and said that he was “going the country in the wrong direction.
“ I’m worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren's criticism on Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Judge.
On Friday, Warren on Twitter said, “Of course, we have to let the FBI investigate the matter before the vote is made. ”
However, a Thursday review shows that the majority of Warren’s elections do not think that it should be offered by 2020.
Fifty - eight percent of the “probable ” voters in Massachusetts said that the Senator should not offer himself, according to a survey published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent claimed to support her offer.
The survey showed more support for the former government manager Deval Patrick, where 38 percent claimed to support his possible offer, and 48 percent said they were opposed to it.
Among other popular Democrats who were discussed for a possible presidential offer in 2020 were Joe Biden, former Vice-President, and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Senatorship from Vermont.
Biden said he was going to make a public decision in January, as reported by Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the Rash Disaster of Track Palin at a election meeting at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening
“ My son is going through great difficulties after returning, I feel with other families who experience the effects of shock disturbance and the spiritual wounds with which our soldiers return home, ” she said to the audience at a election meeting for Donald Trump, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the file in the room ” and said that her son and other warrior soldiers“ came back just differently, they are hardened and wondering whether any respect is given to what their armymates and air forces and other army departments have done for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged for domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent announcement of domestic violence and arms under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police officer in Wasilla.
18 Countys and Washington D.C. support the challenge of a new refugee leadership policy
Eighteen states and Washington City support a legal challenge against the new policy of the United States, which refuses victims who flee to walk or home violence for refuge.
Representatives of the 18 and the city submitted a trial report on Friday in Washington to support a refugee seeker who contradicts the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions' Appeal by the American Civil Liberties Union has not been given up.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons who were members of the gathering ” had committed her violence, but U.S. officials rejected her application for refuge on July 20th.
She was held in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Hondura, and Guatemala as countries where problems associated with gangs and domestic violence are increasing and many refugee visitors to the United States come from these countries.
The new refugee leaders revoked the decision of the appeal committee of immigrants in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fled home violence to apply for refuge.
On Friday, state prosecutor Karl Racine declared that the new policy “has ignored decades of national and international laws. ”
“The national law requires a decision on all refugee applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and these policies are violating this rule,” said the Court of Justice.
Moreover, in the report, lawyers stated that the policy that denied immigrants to enter into would be harmful to the US economy, and claimed that immigrants were more likely to establish businesses and “have an important work force. ”
Jeff Sessions, a prosecutor of the State, ordered judges in immigrant matters to stop refugeing victims who fled home violence and prosecution in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on races, religions, nationalities, or members of a certain social group or political views may seek refuge, ” said Sessions in their announcement on June 11.
Residence authorities were never intended to solve all problems, not even all serious problems that people are dealing with every day around the world.
Hopeful rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead doubles
Conditions become more and more difficult for those who survived.
“ There is a great excitement in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son in the center of help in Pala.
“ Hospital cars are bringing bodies here all the time.
There's little of clean water."
The inhabitants were seen return to their devastated homes and search for their water sausages to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded, and hospitals are overwhelmed and damaged after the earthquake measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broken back and shoulder, were outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were bound to the outdoor because of continued powerful afterquake.
His tears filled his eyes, when he told him how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth hill, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed up to the walls, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassadors blame China for persecution with "property advertising"
A week after a public newspaper in China published four recent advertisements in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual advantages in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassadors of China in Beijing accused themselves of using American media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, last Wednesday talked about the advertising of the Chinese magazine in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China to try to intervene in the United States' elections that will be on November 6, and China refuses this charge.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere with the U.S. elections marked what official U.S. representatives stated by Reuter’s news office that there was a new stage of increasing campaign from Washington to use Chinese pressure.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote business, Beijing and Washington have a constant trade war, with new customs duties on import goods in both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say that early in the business war, China’s revenge bills were designed to injure emigrants in councils such as Iowa, who supported the reputation group of Trumps.
Terry Branstad, Ambassador of the United States in China, and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a county transporting a lot of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad, in his report on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, said that “Chinese was now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda advertising in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is exploiting the loved language - free spirit of the United States and our free media by publishing a costly advertising in Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in his article.
“ On the other hand, few protest voices can be found in press stores in the streets of Beijing, and there is no real reflection of the different views that Chinese might have on the anxious economic policy of China, since media are stuck under the Chinese Communist group’s hack, ” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China escaped the invitation to publish ” his article, but he did not explain what magazine it was.
Experts warn that the reputations are making female choosers disagree with them for the mid-term reviews with Kavanaugh.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, during the next mid - era, because many reputations have supported and protected Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge, who has faced the accusations of sexual harassment.
Such feelings have been very strong, and most reputations have already shown publicly that they wanted to begin a vote.
“ These things cannot be backed, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School Institute at the University of Syracuse, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted the call of the Senator Jeff Flake, the Senator of the Republic of Arizona, in the last minute on a FBI study is sufficient to calm down the choosers.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, supervisor and speaker for the Freely MoveOn group on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, the Protestants sang “November approached! ” when they protested at the circumstance of the elderly department when the Republicans who managed the decision committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s name, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ The enthusiastic and enthusiastic electoral will rise out of all power, ” said Stu Rothenberg, independent of the politician, at the newspage.
“ People will say that interest has already been great, and it is true.
But he could be greater, especially with female choosers in the suburbs and younger choosers, 18-29 years old, who hate the President, but rarely choose."
The reporters foretold a relapse if the reputators pressed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for Ford’s testimony as she declared her accusations of sexual insistence from him.
“ This has become a great cloth for the Republican group, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Republican Group’s National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The matter is not only about the votes of the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is taken on the class, but also about how the reputations have handled this and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, president of the United States Priorities, a group who assists in choosing the Democrats, at the news station.
However, the Americans seem to disagree who should believe in a witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and the majority of them support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the respondents surely or probably believed the witness from Ford, while 35 percent claimed to be sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh’s witness.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they believed that Kavanaugh was likely or surely lying in their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the Flake call, the FBI is now investigating the accusations presented by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, as reported by Guardian.
Ford witnessed the oath before the elderly committee last week and said that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.

The man who discovered the Internet has planned to start a new Internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who discovered the network, is going to set up a sprota company to fight against Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, open Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the intention behind Inrupt was “the superiority of the world. ”
“ We have to do this now, ” he said about the sprota company.
"This is a historical moment."
The program uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “Private Online Data Store” or POD.
There can be a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections and other personal and work-related devices.
It is similar to that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data store is that it is fully subject to the user who can get access to any information.
The company calls it “Personal qualification by using data. ”
According to John Bruce, the manager of the company, the idea is that Inrupt is that the company provides resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now composed the company of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security job purchased by IBM, a number of IBM developers who were appointed to work for the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers worldwide can create their own independent programs with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that would put their current business model on their head in one night.
“ We do not ask for permission. ”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday in Media that Inrupt was “to create energy in business and ecosystems that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid. ”
Berners-Lee converted the network in 1994 when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the discussion of the network's neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes up with Inrupt.
“ I am full of optimism for the next period of the network, ” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest and handmaster of Victoria Crusade from World War I honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria crucifix during World War I, a soldier who has been celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
On September 29, 1918, Sergeant Bernard Vann, who served as chief of the army, received the cross in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, a secret shooter killed him four days later, and he was never told that he had received the highest glory of the British army.
Two of his grandsons revealed memories about him during a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “wonderfully symbolic ” that the memorial was revealed exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s honor.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann’s superior army led the Canal de Saint-Quentin circuit “through a very thick thick thickness and under severe shooting from guns and machine guns. ”
Later, he ran to the gunline, and with “great courage, ” he carried the line forward before he attacked the gun of one of his armies and overwhelmed three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only a month before the end of the war, a German secretian killed a superior.
Michael Won, aged 72, said that his grandfather’s heroes were “something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the flower after the march, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he had “a great privilege of participating in the march, ” adding that“ the deeds of true heroes are shown with the support that so many show. ”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, got instead of seeing Gurru pigs
Imagine, having wake up all night to see an over-full Bellator 206, just to be refused to see the main event.
The program included 13 battles from San Jose, six of them on the main record, and they were displayed in direct broadcasting all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., precisely when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences had an unexpected event when the broadcast changed to Gurru pig.
Some were dissatisfied after watching the battle all night long.
One fan on Twitter described the change to the child’s subject as “a kind of sick joke. ”
“ According to public rules, the material was not qualified for the audience at 6: 00 a.m. so they had to switch into childhood matters, ” said Dave Schwartz, Vice - President of Marketing and Communication for Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Gurry pigs, yes."
Scott Coker, director Bellator, said that they would go through their schedules and take the viewers in Britain into account in the future.
“I think when I think about the reconciliation that we could probably solve this, ” said Coker.
“ But it’s six o’clock on Sunday, and we can’t solve this until Sunday until our day, which is Monday with them.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when a shipping was changed, a number of text messages were sent forward and back, and they were not all kind.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise this won't happen next time.
We limit the evening to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out of our way.
This is an unhappy state."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley experienced “discomfort ” due to sex
The Olympic Deep Man Tom Daley said that he felt inadequate with other people in his breeding because of his sexuality, but that it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others ” until he went to high school. ”
In the Radio Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others “hope. ”
He also said that the role of his parents reduced his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the ordinary coordinator, has taken a few months of vacation because of illness.
Daley, first of all, was able to make Laverne feel “lesser ” than all others when he was a child because“ it was not agreed in the community to love both boys and girls. ”
He said: “Until this day, these feelings of being subtle have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something, ” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment at the end of his sexuality.
The double Olympic Bronshaw has been a great supporter of LGBT and has used its participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he was being heard because he felt lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world champion said that it “had surprised him ” to become in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who he first met in 2013.
Daley married the 20 - year - old occupational occupational occupation, who said that the difference between age and age was never a problem.
“ When you go through so much as you are young ” - but he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find the same elder who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley, said that his “all the beliefs of life ” had been crippled.
"If you asked me last year, everything was about winning a golden prize," he said.
“ You know, there are more important things than the gold prize of the Olympics.
Robbie is my olympic gold prize."
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, aged 40, after he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had already received his tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“ I couldn’t say to him that he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row, ” he said.
“ I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breath stopped, and he was killed that I finally admitted that he was not indefeated, ” he said.
Next year, Daley competed for the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze prize.
“ I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, diveing in front of the audience at the Olympics at home, ” he said.
It was also inspired to the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - who had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a British local time.
Mickelson in a bad form and let's sit in the class in the Ryder cup on Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will be awarded on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder cup, but he needs to find back his old taches so that it is not estimated to be surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time of the race, was allowed to sit in the class after lord Jim Furyk’s decision for the four - ball races and four - games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hazard, as it has been so many times before the United States, the day of the five - fold master is divided between being a clam controller and practicing the plays on the field in the hope of correcting what he does.
Mickelson, a 48 - year - old, was never the one who shot with the killers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Gulffield, where the desire of glomps often punishes for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf area is a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson has to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of British Open, in the nineth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new team Tommy Fleetwood, and together they have won all its four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below when they take the first game of 12 single games, reach a good start, Mickelson’s play could be a big deal.
Furyk declared his trust in his husband, but he could hardly say much more.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, claped on my back and caught around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has a lot of self - confidence.
He's in the famous hall, and he's been so much refined for the past before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more, but so this ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will strike Nick Faldo in a number of games played in the Ryder cup on Sunday.
This could market the end of the process in the Ryder cup that has never achieved quite as high as any other result on his file.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses, and 7 equals, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain unclear effect on the team.
“ He is funny, he is sarcastic, he likes to make fun of people, and it is great to have him in the team room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjørn, the leader of Europe, knows that a lot of advances can soon go away
The European leader Thomas Bjørn knows of the experience that the last day of the individual race in the Ryder cup can easily turn into uncomfortable experience.
The Danin first played in Valderrama in 1997, where the leader Seve Ballesteros had five stages ahead of the Americans, but was right to win at the end with a minimum possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“You always remind yourself that we had a lot of headship in Valderrama, we had a lot of headship in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but only right,” said Björn, which is seen here on the picture, after watching the 2018 yeargang, working 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and reaching the forehead 10-6 at the Le Golf National Velline.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't done.
We'll all work out tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all the points are on the table.
We have our goals and it's trying to win this cup, we're focusing on it.
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we're very aware of our opponents in the other team - the best golfers in the world."
Bjørn was very pleased with his players ’ difficult situation and added: “I never go beyond myself in this.
The morning will be all different.
Tomorrow’s standing is important, and it’s another thing.
It's great to play with a companion when everything's going well, but when you play one one is tried on all the people's talents as a golfer.
It is the messages that must be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and you also have to play your best game yourself."
Unlike Björn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek to make his players stand better in individual games than with companions, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who worked three points of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big change on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle of Medinah. ”
“ I remember every damn word, ” he answered how Ben Crenshaw, the previous one in 1999, had continued to encourage his players for the last day.
“ We need to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start fast, as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When the cry is closer to building up, it causes great pressure on the games in the middle.
We ordered our players accordingly and let them play as we think we'll go best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to defend and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the plays.
“I chose these players in this order because I think they were all the way through,” said Bjørn about their choice of players in the individual race.
Germany’s New Army Ship Delayed Again
The latest ships of the German Marine should have been built in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be prepared until the first year of the next year because of broken systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
Based on the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leadershipship of the Genetic Army of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of the year 2019, according to the records of the military speaker who spoke to Die Zeit.
The ship was supposed to be helped by the Marine in 2014, but serious problems after dismissing the project were tackled.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg group ordered by the Marine in 2007 are to replace the ships of the Bremen group, who have come to their years.
They should be prepared for a powerful parachute, a lot of air- and navigation missiles and hide engines such as reduced radar infrared and sound signals.
Other important features are a longer time of use - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years from their home ports.
However, constantly meant that these newest-type army ships - which are said to enable Germans to show their strength on the sea - will be as soon as they are finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 warship arrived in the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the fleet and returned to the Blohm & Voss Drop in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Marine has returned a ship to the manufacturer after dismissal.
It was not known about the reasons behind it, but the German media spoke of many women who were seriously “deficiencies in software and hardware ” that made the ship useless if they were sent to a campaign.
Defects in software were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg army will be controlled by 120 men's crew, which is half less than in Bremen's army ships.
It also revealed that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the power of the marine to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000 tons of “Rheinland-Pfalz ” ships are considered to be twice thinner than ships in a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
Outside the defects of machinery, the cost of all the project - including the training of the crew - has started to cause problems.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but it was originally to be 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest ships are particularly important in the light of the warning that the superiority of the Germans on the outside is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defense Committee, acknowledged that the Marine was actually to become “revolved by vessels. ”
The deputy said that the problem had incredible in time, for older ships were taken out of use but no ships came into their place.
He regretted that none of the commands of Baden-Wuerttemberg group could be taken into use by the Marine.
National Faith Natural Protection Association spys on a secret life of leather leather
A new study of the Scotland area aims at finding out how leathers use the landscape when fishing for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behavior of these uniquely flying mammals and help to guide future natural protection operations.
The research conducted by scientists at National Trust for Scotland will monitor various species of butterfly in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be set up at key points around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather leather over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also be monitored with handheld senses.
Experts will identify all recordings to find the frequency of calls that the leather leathers give out and what kinds do what.
A map of farms and reports will then be published in order to produce a precise picture of their geographical behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS’ Nautical Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of living area is most important for the butterflies and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the potential for managing areas, e.g. by creating noise and the best way to maintain forest lands for baths and other related species.
In the last century, leather has fallen significantly in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects which affect their farms and reduce their lives.
Windmills and lights can also lead to risks, including fly papers, and certain rename managers of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
Leathers are not really blind.
However, their ears benefit them much better than their eyes when fishing bread, because they are usually fishing in the night.
They use high - advanced rocking techniques to find insects and items on their flight.
NTS, responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes leather leather leather very seriously.
In the organisations, ten experts carry out regular checks, cattle reviews, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and one leather - blue country of Scotland at the Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten leather - carpet species of Scotland own their home.
David Thompson, overseer of the farm, says he is a perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for butterfly,” he said.
“ We have old buildings, enough of grown trees and full of good dwellings.
But there are still many things unaware of leather leather, so the work that we work here and in other places will help us to understand better what they need to be cleaned."
He emphasized the importance of checking leather leathers before maintenance in dwelling places, since possible accidental destruction in one cattle can kill up to 400 female leathers and young and destroy all leathers in the area.
Leathers are protected, and it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot of lessons on leather leather, and we don’t know how well many of their species are. ”
Ronaldo denies the accusations of rape when lawyers prepare a law against a German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of rape “false news ” and says that people want to“ raise attention ” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The leadership of Portuguese and Juventus has been accused of raping a American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the news of Der Spiegel on Friday, he paid her $375,000 before silence of the event.
A few hours after the accusations were published, Ronaldo, 33 - year - old, in the Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers said they were “false news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times at the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, which is part of the work.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added to smiling.
According to Reuters ’ newsroom, lawyers Ronaldos are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations, which they have called “inappropriate publication of suspicions of private life. ”
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, Ronaldo would demand a repetition of “the seriousness of the fraud, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years. ”
The meaning of the event, said in June 2009, took place in a suite on the Palms Hotel and the casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the player, where he was supposed to have rape her in the end of the army, according to documents submitted for the Clark County County.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the mentioned incident and told her that he was “99 percent of a good man ” who fell into temptation because of“ 1 percent. ”
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both agreed.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and took pictures of her injury at the hospital, but finally agreed to the unity outside of the court because she was “deathless of vengeance operations ” and was worried about being“ humiliated publicly. ”
She now says she wants to stop the sweets because she is still in shock after a mean incident.
Ronaldo was near to go to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was to take place, and in some summer he went over to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: Britain would “congratulate forever ” to lose car manufacturers
Britain would “secure forever ” if it lost its position as an international leader among Brexit car manufacturers, says Greg Clark Business Minister.
He added that it was a “anxiety” that Toyota United Kingdom had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without a contract, the company would stop temporary production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that if Brexit was uncontracted, it would cost jobs from a delay to the border.
Burnaston Manufacturer of Toyota Auris and Avensis cars produced nearly 150,000 previously cars, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
“I believe that if Britain is shocked from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production stations in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Director Toyota, Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about EU exits without agreeing on how intermediate businesses should be conducted, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that if Brexit becomes a reality without a contract, what automobile manufacturers say is a risk of adhesion.
The Toyota production lines are based on the reception of the last hour, where items are delivered every 37 minutes from stocks in both Britain and the EU for cars produced after order.
If Britain cuts off the EU without a contract on 29 March, the borders that the industry considers can lead to delay and lack of parts could be disturbed.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day-to-day in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Theresu May Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union “was specifically designed to prevent these views at the borders. ”
“We have to have a contract, and we want the best deal that enables us not only to enjoy success in modern times, but as an opportunity we can use,” he said at BBC Radio 4.
“ The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with very successful ways.
Toyota could not tell how long their production would be stopped, but he warned that for a long time, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a confident of the Working Society in the factory, said that his employees are increasingly worried: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
A spokesman of the government said: “We have put forward a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the European Union. ”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared, therefore, on Sunday, that a important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the assistant prosecutor, could be “reparated again for one week” now the dispute of Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge, continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian campaigns in elections, links between the supporters of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President's justice.
For weeks, historys have gone in Washington about whether Trump will run the aid prosecutor and thus endanger Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times stated that Rosenstein had discussed a recording recorder to interact with Trump and the possibility of rubbing the president from the seat by using the 25th additional section of the governance file.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, including the news that he was going to say it.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said “predominantly not ” wants to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was deferred to be not at the same time as a hearing from the Senatorial Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him of sexual exercisement, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly study of the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further deferred the vote fee of the elderly department.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s media officer, was broadcast in the Fox News Sunday series.
When she was asked for a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It has not been a date for him, it could be this week, and I think that he may be postponed for another week because of everything else that is going to be done at the Supreme Court.
But we see, and it is always a pleasure to inform the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a newspaper meeting in the White House since September 10th.
The media manager, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not dissatisfied with the fact that television newspapers had “visuality, ” but she said:“ I do not disagree with the fact that they have visuality. ”
She then gave evidence that the direct connection between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more media questions than any other president has done before, ” she said, “without referring to the records,“ we have crossed these numbers. ”
“ If the media have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, ” said Sanders, “it’s much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of the last few weeks, and it will replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit it.
The only one with him is rare.
The president may have shown the reason for that in New York this week, when he showed inhibitive and in times of strange behavior in front of a group of newspapers.
The EU Health Minister writes to staff within the health system in Scotland because of Brexit’s concerns
The health minister has written to EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare their appreciation and wish to continue their work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of the EU's official service providers' applications for authorisation.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter: “In the summer, discussions between Britain and the European Union have continued because of statements and are expected to take a decision in the autumn.
The British Government has also worked to prepare if it is not possible to become a contract.
I know this must be a great time of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to say it again how much I appreciate the work of all the employees, no matter where their nationality is.
Cooperations from the European Union and others provide precious experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and benefit the patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is really your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergone emergency surgery after having had a headache
Christion Abercrombie, tennessee State Tiger’s liner, had to take an emergency surgery after having suffered a head injury in 31-27 losses against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report by Mike Organ, journalist Tennessean.
Rod Reed, supervisor Tennessee State, said to the newspapers that the injury had occurred shortly before a half - game.
“ He came to the sideline and fell down there, ” said Reed.
Coachs and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on the burden and carried out for further consideration.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris, radioman WSMV in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie was under surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were “no information about the form or seriousness of the effect yet ” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.

He had five chunks all on Saturday before he went out, which increased the total number of chunks with him to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged for higher polls when buying property in Britain
Abroad buyers will be charged for higher polls when purchasing property in Britain.
The operation will not succeed Corbyn's campaign to attract young choosers
Increased polls will be applied to those who do not pay tax in Britain
Kingdom treasures estimate 120 million pounds a year to help homeless ones.
Abroad buyers will be charged for higher polls when buying property in Britain. The money will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation is considered to be an attempt to fail the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young choosers by promising accommodation at the disposal and taxing people more.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain have to pay higher stamp fees, and the surplus will take action by the government to assist homeless people.
The increase - which is additional to the current plunger fees, including the increase that was added two years ago to extra homes and real estate purchases for rent - could be up to three percent.
A government’s treasure estimates that the increase will produce up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new buildings are purchased by foreign parties, which causes increases in prices and makes it more difficult for those who want to buy property for the first time to get into the market.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost towns ” because of the number of foreign buyers spending their most time abroad.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in polls to help other young people get their first home.
He accused a large construction company to keep real estate high by buying landmarks but not using them, and May urged to cancel quotas at homes in order to adjust the “contemporary disadvantages ” of Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of considerable reimbursements in housing matters, including the tax oversight and the end of taxation without charge.
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “In the past I said that I would devote myself to the restoration of the British dream during my first period — that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And that involves adjusting our infringement of our property market.
The door of Britain will always open up to those who want to live here, work and build up their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreign parties as for businesses with foreign headquarters to buy homes and for thorough British nationals.
For many the dream of their own house has become too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Jack Ross, Sunderland’s trainer, says that it is his “prime goal ” to become a trainer in Scotland at some time.
This 42 - year - old Scot now enjoys the challenge of breathing a new life in the North-East club, which is now sitting at the third seat of the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Division in the last stage.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was hurt on my knee and thereby finished," said Ross in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be available if I'd be able to train the department."
Ross trainers in Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer of the Alloa Athletic Club said that he had not found any fear of following in the footsteps of such a big club, but he had previously rejected trainer positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ As is, I will speak my success by thinking: ‘ Can I return this club to the decorative department? ’
This club is certainly at home in the excellent department because of his structure and position," he said.
“ It’s not easy to get him there, but I would probably only think I’d be happy here if I got the club back up there. ”
Ross has only three years of experience as a trainer after the period of assistant training in Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a Heart trainer.
He helped Alloa to recover from falling into the third department, and he changed St. Mirren, who was about to join the department, to the department champion next stage.
Ross says he's more self-safe now than he's ever been on his game at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“ This was probably a real time, ” he says about the period when he became the trainer of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work fits me, even more than playing.
It sounds weird, for I did well, and I had good earnings of it, and enjoyed good success.
But changes can be difficult.
You need to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through stress and pressure from the work, but the training work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I have never felt better with myself in all my adult years."

The best time for beer is 17.30 a.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
The summer heat wave has proved to be a reward for British bars that have a disastrous effect, but the pressure on restaurants has increased.
Sales in pubs and beats increased by 2.7% in July, but sales at restaurants decreased by 4.8% according to numbers.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Business Advisory Company, who collected the numbers, said: “The continuing sunshine and unexpected success of England in the world cup meant that July followed similar patterns and Junes, when barsala grew by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell about 1.8 percent in restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Puppies and bars, which were mainly directed by drinking, had a great deal of upturn while restaurants went down.
Puppies who sold food also had difficulties in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out drinking.
The sale of drinks in pops and beats increased by 6.6 per cent before the month, but food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a reporting company RSM, said: “These findings are the continuation of the fluctuation that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of important social events or sports events are still the largest factors in sales outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in trouble, although sales reductions of 4.8 per cent between months are particularly painful above the continuing pressure due to costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly get worse time for dinner, and only the time will reveal whether to temprate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in pops and restaurants, including in newly opened places, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the ability of openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with sales in the British bar and restaurants, collects and reports data from 47 business groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds, and is the industrial standard for the industry.
One out of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
According to the results of the survey, one of five children, up to 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers.
A review of 20,000 students showed an increase in the "surve Insta" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual matters
Twenty percent of students say that they have “particular” accounts that they show to parents
One out of five children, up to 11 years old, creates secret accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A review of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in the “sweet Insta” accounts – a reference to the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual matters.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a pure “prime ” account to show parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Prime School Manager (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 years had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It is anxiety that so many youths are tempted to create areas on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected in the Scottish Athletics Committee as a boss without authority at the annual General Meeting of the Government.
Doyle, the most successful free - sporting woman of Scotland and Ian Beattie, chairman of the Committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the international field last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in sports in Scotland, Britain, and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money to get it in the committee, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hoping that I will be able to take part and help to carry on sports in Scotland. ”
The American man, who worked among ananr 200 meters and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in the Atlantic in 1996, has a total of four Olympic Gold, and is now regularly visited by BBC, was paralyzed after a transient infarction of blood.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would reveal whether I was normal and then how much.
This has been hard work, but I used to go full, learn to walk again and do sports exercises today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!"
An advertising of carcases comparing mothers with cows causes a network disagreement
A company that produces breast-feeding pumps is now discussed on the Internet because of advertisements that carry lactating mothers with choirs that are milked.
The company Elvie published a innovative advertising to highlight what is said to be “the first silent breast pump in the world that can be carried out”. The ad is inspired by musical videos and should show the freedom that new pumps give to mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a cabin full of hooks and cows with songs like: “Yeah, I'm milking, but you don't see any stairs on me,” and “If you didn't notice it, these are not yokes, but my breasts.”
The supplement continues: “Pumpa, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, pump, I pump milk from the juwels. ”
However, the advertising, which appears on the Facebook page of the company, has caused an online review.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has had a different reaction from audiences, which tells many that it was ganting with the “whylling ” that follows the milk industry.
“ It’s really a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to be filled with calfs and bear to produce milk, except what the calfs are taken from them only a few days after they are born,' said one comment.
Elvie breast pump is suitable for breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another audience wrote: “It’s very difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pot for mothers who may keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertising is totally out of proportion to time. ”
Others defended the ad, and one woman acknowledged that the song would be “awesome. ”
“ I think this is a great idea.
I'd have bought this way if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “This is a fun advertising that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside the bathroom) and feel like “cows. ”
This is not a advertising that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the advertising, the female group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breasts.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like cows when pumping off milk.
However, the Elvie pump is quite silent, has no wires or guides, and fits comfortably in a breastmate, which gives women freedom to move, hold on to their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a co - owner and boss of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she deserved an outstanding presentation that would bring about it.
By comparing women with cows, we wanted to direct the chestlight to the breast pumping and all its challenges, even showing in a entertaining and well - known way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump got into the news.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two children presented a fashion show to the designer Martha Jakubowski while using her product.
Hundreds of immigrants moved quietly to tent camps at the Texas border
The number of migrants in the preservation has suddenly increased even though the number of those who cross the borders of a month has kept the same one, part of the reason is that hard talks and policies established by the government of Trump have made it harder to bring children into temporary abortion.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and have feared to put their chances of remaining in danger by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when the official authorities announced that possible foster parents and other adults in the home would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the Immigration Survey.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the Immigration and Customs Supervisor, witnessed before the elder’s department and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who were seeking to foster unemployed children.
The Foundation later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not in charge.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in homes who foster children are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants in a register of charges.
“ So we keep looking for their individuals, ” said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to move faster on the children’s affairs, representatives informed of new rules that require some of the children to appear at the courtroom within a month of their preservation, rather than after 60 days of previous standards, according to the professionals working in the trials.
Many of them will come through video meetings, rather than in their own personality, to give reasons for their legal status before judges in immigrant matters.
The children who are convicted unable to enter the country are sent quickly from the country.
The longer children are maintained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or refugee attempts, according to the staff of the refugees and reports published by the system in recent months.
Talents said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution, such as in Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice the difficulties of a child because of their number.
They added that the transfer of children to the tent city without spending enough time to prepare them spiritually or by the greeting of friends could increase the shock that many of them already face.
Syria says that the United States, France and Turkey should return immediately.
Walid al-Moualem, Minister of Foreign Affairs, also in his speech at the General Assembly said that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of Deputy Prime Ministers, said that foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false idea of fighting against terrorism, and that “terrorism will be treated accordingly. ”
“ They must return immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the Congress.
Moualem firmly argued that in Syria, “the war against terrorism was nearly finished, ” where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to pursue this sacred struggle until we cleanse all Syrian areas“ from both terrorist groups and“ all illegal foreign parties. ”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both courdian armies and Syrian Arubs who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 armies in this war - disgusting country.
As regards the matter of refugees, Moualem said that circumstances were sufficient to return, and he taught “some Western countries ” to“ spread out reasonless fear ” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on international society and humanity to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“ They create politics from something that should be mere humanity. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not grant any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Erindrager S.U. says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a neutral area at the last large contests of the opposition has created an opportunity to continue political conversation.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented great attacks by Syrian armies of Russia in the district of three million people.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed that the contract had “a specific finality” and declared the hope that military operations would be directed to Jihadises, including Nusra Front fighters, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, and that they would be “exterminated. ”
Staffan de Mistura, Ambassador S.T., hopes to be able to meet the first meetings with a new committee as members of the government and the opposition, to draw up Syria's governance after the war and pay the street for elections.
Moualem presented a requirement for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, and said that its work should be limited to “going over the current government’s regulations” and warned against all intervenements.
Reason for Trump to win another election period
According to that reasoning, Mr Trump would win the re-elections in 2020, unless the accusation and intimidation would end his presidential business, as many voluntary observers are likely to hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of presidential life ever! ”
Like audiences have no tired marks.
Since 2014, the best time view has increased more than double to 1.05 million in CNN and almost threefolds to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million audiences at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a part of the MSNBC, “The Rachel Maddow Show,” has toped audience with up to 3.5 million audiences at important news evenings.
“This is a fire that people get attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, member of the ABC drama program “Designed Survivor” on a person in the government who becomes president after the seat is destroyed in the attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced scientist and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another idea.
She remembers a ride in a taxi in Boston for the elections in 2016.
The taxi driver told her he was going to choose Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Ms. Scovell to me.
There are entertainment values in the disturbance.
Unlike television, however, the stories from Washington may determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants’ families can unite with the health of the international economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privileges can afford to stop watching.
Yet, this is more than to be an informed citizen when you look at the sixth time of the group of experts reasoning the use of Bob Woodwards on “very close” sources for his book “Fear, ” or $15,000 jackets from the cows that Paul Manafort was dressed (“like with pride, ” said the Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
I'll at least never see Super Mario the same eyes again.
“A part of what he does and makes you feel this is like a reality element, that he gives you something every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, director Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the parts “Pawn Stars”, when he discussed the workforce in the show of Trumps and daily changes in the history thread (e.g. starting a struggle with N.F.L. and commendation in Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one part, or you're gonna lose your lust.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and looked at MSNB while he picked up CNN.
He could not cut himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be witnessed before the Board of Judgments, and the future of the Supreme Court was in question.
“I remember when we made all these crazy features in ancient times and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilizations,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“ I thought this was some kind of joke, but it showed that people were right. ”

Money outside flows in the narrowest elections of the Middle Ages
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania region sees the money flowing to itself, thanks to the reorganization of the electoral areas that led two representatives to race around the same seat.
The newly reorganized Pittsburg area sends forward the Democrat Conor Lamb, who worked his seat in another region in special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself to another representative, the reputation Keith Rothfus, who is now representative of the old 12th Pennsylvania choosing, which differs greatly with the new 17th choosing area.
The maps of the elections were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old electoral areas were organized in the interests of the reputations and that it violates the governance.
The race in the new 17th election area has begun to compete in the funding of election campaigns between the main financial partners of both categories, the Democratic Electoral Committee (DCCC) and the NRCC.
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after the narrow victory of the special elections in March for the 18th Pennsylvania, but many monitored the elections.
The republics had previously heated its seat for more than a decade, and the President of Donald Trump had won a victory of 20 degrees.
Political experts have given democrats some priority.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for the support of China, but then resigned.
Emperors noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already accepted Beijing, with little objections from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, president of Panama in June 2017, and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the co-owner of the Trump team ran away.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama for “a new decision to no longer acknowledge the Tavan, ” said Heather Nauert, the speaker of the Ministry in early this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for assistance in 2017, including drug surveillance, development and economic support.
The penalties, including reducing financial support and restrictions on the release of residence, would have been painful for the Mediterranean country, with a high unemployment rate and high incidence of death.
Following the continuation of internal meetings, American and Mediterranean representatives postponed a Security and Economic Success Conference and were to follow a similar meeting that was previously held and considered to be step forward in actions to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But by mid - September, representatives from the top rows made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus ended all the absences of punishment against El Salvador.
Vice - President Mike Pence is now addressing the conference to be held in the middle of October as a symbol of its importance in the eyes of the government, said the advocates.
The three U.S. consignees also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman of the White House for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions described by the three American representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the indoor talks against being nameless.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external diagnostic who works closely with the government and also talked about the case against unnamedness.
Learning the Story
The next offense could be Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, report on Mr. Trump's possible actions to prevent justice, but for that accusation there are numerous public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also relys on his research on whether Mr. Trump's election campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the congress is controlled by another group, Trump may have to be responsible for it, at the time he prepares to meet his choosers again, and perhaps the abdominality of his companions.
However, this is very uncertain, and I would not say that Trump's fall is indisputable, nor his colleague's fall in Europe.
We all have to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German rulers were prepared to rob Hitler’s power, only if Western countries had contradicted him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of disaster that followed.
The history turns around such important points and speeds or delays for the inevitable progress of democracy.
The Americans are faced with some of these important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs the Rod Rosenstein State Prosecutor, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was inappropriate in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times news is wrong.
“How will we react if the newly requested study of Brett Kavanaugh FBI is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Judge despite credible accusations of sex and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we choose a Senate in the middle period that will give Mr. Trump the burden of responsibility?
If we fall under these tests, the democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I think we won't fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother, a Jew from Czechoslovakia, was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government, sitting in my ambassador’s dwelling.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to fire on the Sabbath candles on the table with the hake cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I, but look positively to our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Ranger's lecturer, optimism for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians will make them in a strong position to get out of the G group of European Departments.
Measurement on the knee prevented the guardian Graham Dorrans from playing his first game during the game before in the game against Villareal, which ended with 2-2 equals, but he believes that Rangers can use the finals as a jumping board to improve the success.
“ It was good to get this point for us, for Villarreal is a strong team, ” said Dorrans, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could reach something and ended up taking one point.
Perhaps we could have gained a victory at the end, but in the overall sense, it was probably just as reasonable.
They probably were better in the first half, and we got strongly into the second half game and played better.
On Thursday, another important evening is for the European Department.
Hopefully, we can reach three points, but it'll be a hard game because they're going well in their last game, but with the audiences who support us, I'm sure we'll endure this and get a positive conclusion.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injury and the changes that became in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling.
The team is good and the boys enjoy their training.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last stage behind us and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing pension savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of them, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide survey, said, they discussed the cost of long - term research with their mates.
Only 10 percent said they were discussing this with their children.
“ People want a family member to care about it, but they don’t take the right steps to have those conversations, ” said Holly Snyder, Lieutenant of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Department.
Here we go.
Talk to your mate and children: If you do not make your wishes clear, you can’t prepare your family for care.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you will be cared for, for these options can make a great difference in expenses.
Ask your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you to find a way to pay for this expense.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term research are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance paid in money, helping to pay costs, or self-security with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal dispute.
Give a healthcare officer a name to someone you trust in taking care of your healthcare career and ensure that healthcare professionals meet your wishes if you cannot directly tell them yourself.
Consider, too, a practitioner for your financial affairs.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for your own hand and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Don’t forget about the details: Imagine your elderly father or mother is in a emergency situation and is on the way to a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give the information exactly in the written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It is not just the financial matter, ” said Martin, “but also who the doctors are. ”
“Who are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be ready for that plan."

Earthquakes and flooding waves in Indonesia
At least 384 died from a powerful earthquake and a flood wave in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said representatives, and they are expected to speak the dead to increase.
Since all communications are below, assistants have not been able to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu, which is close to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter.
Over 16,000 people were left in Pala after the calamity.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu, the capital of the Mediterranean District, is located at the bottom of a narrow flood on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was holding its 40 - year birthday when the earthquake and the flood wave came on.
Donggala is a state of more than 380 miles [380 km] of the beach in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The state of the district was estimated to have a population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sectors of employment in the Middle-Sulawes region, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel schools are also important in the region, most of which are in Morowali, on the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Emergency Institute, river waves have scrubbed in Palu and Donggala several times last century.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a flood wave attacked, and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
In 1996, there is also a river wave in the west part of Donggala, where nine died.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of the Pacific, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the major earthquakes and flood waves last years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra ran over on December 26, and started a flood wave that smote 14 countries and killed 226.000 people across the coastline of the Indian Sea, of which over half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shaking went over the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds of people die on the island of Nia, from the coast of Sumath.
2006: A earthquake of 6.8 at Richter railed over the southern part of Judah, the largest island of Indonesia, causing a river wave that swallowed at the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A earthquake of 7.6 at Richter railed over near the city of Padang, the capital of the district in the western part of Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A earthquake of 7.5 at Richter railed over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 meters [10 m] of flood waves that destroyed many villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: The foundation of a earthquake raged over the Pidie Jaya County of Aceh and caused destruction and anxiety when people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and flood wave in 2004.
There was no flood wave for this time, but more than 100 people died when buildings crashed.
2018: Great shaking over the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of travelers were temporarily stuck on the island.

Prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, suspected to have participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been used in the county for infringement of national law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 - year - old, was thought to have taken a Home Depot truck to hit people on a bike trip along the West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan, and he drove down there walking and cycling passengers in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight victims “willingly ” and caused serious physical injuries“ willingly, ” according to the willing statement of the death penalty recorded in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these prosecutors can lead to possible death penalties, according to the trial document.
A number of weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal judgment was accused of 22 teams, including eight accusations of murder for a criminal purpose, which are generally used by prosecutors in charges against organised crime organisations, and Saipov was also accused of violent crime and for destruction of the car.
The attack included a “number of planned plans, ” said the prosecutors and declared Sapiov’s actions as“ horrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov became the cause of physical injury, injury and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, ” says the willing statement.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
It has been a decade since Southern New York the last death punishment.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of murdering two drug dealers but was finally sentenced in lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a trial in New York in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who had been executed after being accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 1953, both couples were executed in the electrical chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of the repentance of the days and months after the attack, according to documents.
He said to an investigator that he would be fine with what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to what the prosecution says.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital, said the police.
He has declared his innocentness in all 22 parts of the accusation.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s official defenders, said that they were “of course disappointed ” with the decision of the prosecution.
“ We believe that the decision to ask for death punishment instead of accepting a guilt declaration against lifetime prison without a possibility of unexperience will only prolong the shock because of these events for all parts,” said Patton.
Saipov's defendants had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek death penalty.
The Consultative Group says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct contractual talks on the basis of Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “act the people’s armies ” today with protests at the Congress of Consumers.
This former leader Ukip said that politicians would have to “find pressure ” from doubters about the European Union at the same time as one of the Congressors, Theresu May, suggested that he conduct the deals with the EU.
Container Peter Bone said at the Birmingham protest tour that Britain would “be gone out ” now if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit.
However, the challenge that May faces to reconcile a deep dispute between her own teams was even more evident when the EU’s inhabitants, who wish to remain in, participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in trouble with keeping his Chequers plan on the right path and sitting under the criticism of those who are embarrassed by Brexit, those opposing, and the EU.
The Americans argued that it would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the opposition and compulsion of those opposed to Brexit and the Workers’ Group to choose between its plans and “invilience. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leave protest courses in Solihull that he wanted to “resolve the Chequers plan. ”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have participated and should have taken responsibility for contractual discussions with Brussels.
"If he was under control, we would have gone out now," he said.
The congressman from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan. ”
He explained his opposition to the European Union and said: “We do not fight during world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected evidence that the opinion of the public had changed from the elections in 2016: “The idea that the British public changed view and wants to stay is absolutely untrue. ”
Andrea Jenkyns, a sustained supporter of Brexit, was also in the protest tour and said to the newspapers: “I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is hostile among the public, and the resistance will not choose with it, but it will enjoy the hostile among our classes and actors who are on the streets and choose us.
Please, stop Chequers' plan and start listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “President ministers keep the work when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr Farage said that politicians would have to “find pressure ” if they were going to deviate from the decision taken after the vote in 2016.
“ This is now about trust in our people and politics, ” he said.
“They want to try to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, “we won’t let you get up with this.”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to put pressure on your political group, who is involved in deviating from Brexit.
We operate the army of the public in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become independent, self-controlling, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest to Birmingham, which ended with a two - time protest meeting in the city.
After the weekend, a small group of surgeons vibrated the flags of Containers against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, of the Workers’ Group, made fun of the inhabitants of security problems that occurred in the class’s telephone program when the group was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have all computer systems okay and all technology for Canada plus, for borders without obstacles, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“It’s a total shock.
There's nothing to call good Brexit," he said.
Warren is going to “continue seriously ” to offer himself to the presidential office.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator, said that after the elections in November, he would “continue considering a serious offer to the presidential office. ”
According to Boston Globe, the Democrat of Massachusetts discussed his future at a civil meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has unusually criticized President-in-Office of the United States, offers a re-evaluation in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-meister in Trump's election campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of the disagreement that she could offer up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke in the afternoon on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with residents in her coastal area, since Trump received an office.
One attendee asked her if she was about to invite herself to the president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and order our government, and that also requires a woman as a leader. ”
Arrest after a fatal attack on Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police reported arrest at Dyteon Simpson, 20 years at a news meeting at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting attack on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man who saw the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
“ Wayde Sims got a bullet in his head and died because of it, ” said Lieutenant Murphy J. Paul, at the media on Saturday, according to a report from 247 sports.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had been in the field with weapons in his ways, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested uncompromisingly, and was retained by the police department of the eastern Baton Rouge.
Sims was two meters high and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, of which 10 in the start team in the last season, and played on average 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points, and reached 2.9 offs every game.
Grand Prix, Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel has given him the seat on order from their team.
It was evident from Valtteri Botta's seat before Lewis Hamilton before launching on Saturday, that orders from Mercedes teams would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton as he deserved his position in the first two curves and invited Vettel to fight his teammate.
Vettel first went into the ceiling and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, which should have been able to make a decision.
The Mercedes car went into the ceiling one circle later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a few conflicts where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave the inner side after having had the risk of remaining, after defence attempts in the third curve.
Max Verstapen started back in the group and was at the seventh seat at the end of the first circle, on his 21 - year birthday.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and go out of Kimi Raikkonen and reach a fourth seat.
Finally, he went to the cave in the 44th circle but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and the Raikon took the fourth seat.
This is a tough day because Valtteri stood beautifully all weekends and was a true gentleman to let me out.
The team has stood amazingly to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
This was really a bad body suppression.
Donald Trump, U.S. President of the United States, made fun of Senator Dianne Finstein at a meeting on Saturday, because of her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in charge of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, on sexual extortion.
The president spoke at a meeting in Western Virginia, but did not directly discuss the witness from Ford for the Elders ’ decision committee, but he said that what was happening at the Senatorial Assembly showed that people were “wrong and cruel and unreasonable. ”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the last days of the elderly department, when you see the anger, when you see people who are ridiculous and evil and cruel and unreasonable, ” he said.
“ When you see the prints and leaks and then say them, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you finish this?
Remember her answer... you left the document - “oh, what?
Oh, no.
"I'm not closing."
Now wait slowly.
Let's go... no, we didn't gamble it," he said, simulated the Senator.
The letter was sent to Finstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh were made, so early in September, finestein refused that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t close her story, ” said Feinstein to the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it in secret, and I did as she asked me. ”
However, her denial seemed not to go well down to the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, this was really a bad exercise.
Maybe she didn't laugh, but this was the worst body suppression I've ever seen."
The President continued his defense for Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual intimidation by three women, and suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of their accusations.
“ They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods they need to use.
You see the cruelty, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overtake to gain power and rule," said the president, according to mediaite news.

A flight manager lets life make hundreds of passengers on a plane escape from earthquakes
A flight manager in Indonesia has been celebrated as a hero after he killed his life to ensure that a flight with hundreds of passengers could take a whole and a shuttle.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a large earthquake raged over the island of Sulawes on Friday and started a flying wave afterwards.
Great afterquakes continue to harass the area, and many are stuck under ruins of Pala.
The 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite his colleagues fleeing from the governing tower, which was violently floating at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was still in order to ensure that the Batik Air plane number 6321, which was on the railway when the earthquake ran over, could surely be aired.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, an advocate of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning, he died before the helicopter reached Palu.
“ We are very sad to hear this, ” he added.
The authorities fear that the number of the dead may exceed a thousand, when the National Emergency Agency says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
“ The figure is that the number of dead continues to rise because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot reach them, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Agency.
Up to six meters [6 m] of high centuries have caused a huge destruction in Pala, where there will be numerous burials on Sunday.
The army and passenger planes work to bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said in an interview with Sky News: “Every minute a ambulance car comes with bodies.
There's little clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross competes to find survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but might go worse."
On Sunday, the president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Pala and said to the army of the country: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the removal.
"Are you ready?" said a news about CNN.
Earlier this year, there were earthquakes over Lombok, Indonesia, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian Air Niugini says that after a plane crashed into the lon, the same thing is now said
The airline, which had an airplane that fell down to a lone in Mikronesia, now says that one person is missing, after previously said that all 47 passengers and crews had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that from afternoon on Saturday, it was not known about the disposal of one male passenger.
The airline said they were working with the authorities of the place, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land on the airport on the Chuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been moved to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were constant.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the precise sequence of events.
The airline and the United States Marines said that the plane had landed in the wagon a little before the airport.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had gone too far over the railway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the flight had been very low.
“ That was really good, ” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade the mid - depth water and find emergency exits in the descending plane.
He said that the pilots had been scared and screaming and that he had suffered a little headache.
The Marine of the United States said that sailors who were at work shortly from making up a bridge also helped the rescue by using an inspired boat to land people before the plane sank in about 30 feet [30 m] deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Institute show that 111 people have died in flight accidents of PNG recorded aircraft over the past two decades, but none of them has been associated with Air Niugini.
A specialist describes the timeline of the evening when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutors concluded their case in the resumption of a case against a man who is accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a expert of the United States Ministry of Justice, was in the courtroom for a number of hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
So he explained to the abdomen how he used mobile records to pump the trips of the 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, the evening she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from some mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, on the contrary to his previous claims, according to the news from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he hadn’t been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked that Tellis was saying he was in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another conflict was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known for one week.
Rowlett said that once after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and her contact information from his phone.
“ He destroyed her out of his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that the defendants will deliver their final talk on Sunday.
The judge said he expected that the case would be brought to an abdomen later that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip jump?
Hipp Hop 3 wants to fight negative views of the music by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hope was removed from its origin, where it contained a political message and discussed social affairs.
They want to look for the origin again and make conscious hip jump popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a rise in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York’s agency laws a couple because of a “prejudiced ” text message
A nurse in New York lawfully retired a married couple after an accidental text message from her mother, complaining that she was “a other black person. ”
So the couple refuses to be prejudiced and compares the prosecution with “prosecution. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, declared dissatisfied when she found that her new foster, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
“NEEEEEIIIII OTHER ANSWERS OF MAN” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them two times to Miss Maurice.
After discovering their mistakes, the “slightest ” of the law, Mrs. Maurice, said that, according to a report from the New York Post, the former foetus who had been dark had made a miserable situation, and that she had expected to receive a Phillipese woman.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now prosecutes the couple and wants a reimbursement of $350 a day for the six - month job she had originally been advised, although no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do this, ” she interviewed Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have protested against the accusations of prejudice, saying that it was the right thing to drive Maurice, because they felt that they could not trust her after they had offended her.
“ My wife sent her a message that she wouldn’t say.
She's not prejudiced.
We are not prejudiced people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust his children for someone after he had shown the same stupidity, even if it was surprised?
His newborn child?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawyer with “depression, ” saying that his wife had arrived seven months and was in“ very difficult situations. ”
“ Are you going to attack someone in this state?
It's not very beautiful done," said Plasco, who works in the investment company.
The matter is still in court, but the public has spoken hard about the couple on social media and embarrassed them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like the speaking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said about the letter: “It’s hard to go into the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was released.
“ It’s very funny now that we know of the immense success of Paddington. ”
She said that her father, who worked as a cop of BBC before he was inspired to write a child book about a small toy bear, had rejected his actions with a calm positive attitude, and added that the 60 - year - old version of the book was “sweet injury ” after his death in the past.
With regard to Paddington, which she describes as “a very important family member, ” she added that her father had proved silently proud of his success.
“ He was a very quiet man, and he wasn’t used to make up, ” she said.
“ But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like a child who accomplished something.
I think he somehow looked at Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington the honor of himself."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to her through the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad regularly called and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said she would die within the next two minutes and I had to say good - bye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the physicians had given her to maintain her heartbeat were gradually losing their activity and being excreted from the body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body to give up.
I had to sit there waiting, knowing this was all happening.
I could not cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved her dead daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
“ No one knew anything, ” she said.
“ I drowned my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt deep compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
A mourning woman hangs up a message to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who had loved ones who had suicide, now try to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey have set up a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, son of Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“ I don’t want any parent to feel like I have to feel every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, said that her son had been a successful cook with a infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could expose any room."
He quit working before he died, for he was “sucked down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler, 11 - year - old, found his brother dead after his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it will result. ”
Ms. Davis created the message “to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing--you need to talk to someone."
Ms. Humphrey, who has been a friend of Miss Davies for years, lost Mark, his mate to 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t say anything about his feelings or feeling depressed or anything like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was up to his worst in Christmas, when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look in their eyes, or anything.
She said that his death was a great shock for them, but that they had to make up with it: “There is a breakthrough on the family.
It'll break us.
But we have to keep on fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a vein thread when the FBI's study
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study of limited time and extent - maybe we could get a little satisfied, ” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would be “disrupted” in the middle of a dispute between the groups where everything was in the back.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Group not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their tiredness is because of the time.
The Mediterranean elections will be in just five weeks, on November 6, and if reputationans, as is expected, will weaken their serious attempts to make their man elected to sit in the Supreme Court of the Land.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, who was Mr Bush’s private secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his research report?
A vote will be held at the Senatorial Assembly, with 51 reputations and 49 Democrats sitting as well.
It is still unlikely that Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the floor of the elderly department, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up as soon as he confirms him in the office of the Supreme Court.
Number of refugees from North Korea “decreases” under Kim’s control
The number of those flying North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong, cited data from the South Korean Council and said that 1127 people had escaped last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that more stringent border warning between North Korea and China and higher charges dealt with by smugglers with people are key elements.
Pyongyang has not published any official declaration.
A large majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that from the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border.
Most of them flee to China, but it has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to go over them rather than the good of neutral areas between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Transport between North and South Korea, which is still in war, technically seen, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for discussions mainly about deferred agreements on nuclear weapons.
This was after a historical meeting in June between President Donald Trump of the United States and President Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in a gross way towards the nucleus-free Korean archipelago.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs, taught US business relations about the lack of progress since then.
“ Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first, ” said Ri in his speech at the S.T. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Mother's Sickness" and says he's inappropriate to act as a Supreme Judge
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority of the Congress, called Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Judge of the Supreme Court, “Mother’s sick, ” and said that he was too temperate to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, Pelosi sent these words into an interview.
“ I could only think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she had been called mother - sick, ” Pelosi said on Thursday about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s decision committee.
Kavanaugh denied the feeling that he had offended Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotionate, sometimes shouting and cracking his throat when he talked about his family and his school years.
He also condemned publicly the Democrats of the Committee and called the accusations on him for “injurious and organized murders ” organised by free - minded men who were angry for the loss of the presidentship of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s witness proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to democrats.
“I think these claims and how he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats show that he is inappropriate to the work, ” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh kicked out of work if he was confirmed and if the Democrats reach the majority of the congress.
“I shall say this: if he is not telling the Congress or the FBI the truth, he is not only unable to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now serves as a judge at Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Motion Act of Roe v. Wade, which is considered a Conservative Judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away from questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a mother-sick, participatory person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say "that is great." Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a righteous speech, months, and years of anger, so it does not come from itself without crying.
“ We wept when we get angry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
“I think it’s not uncommon, but you? ”
She continued, “I received great help from a woman who was director somewhere and said that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she became angry and began to cry, she said to her attendant,“ You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to express some wrath because they are misunderstood in basic elements.
One of my most clear memories from my former work, which I had done in a office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of anger that I couldn’t express, came to an older woman and took on me the neck dream. She was a cold boss who I had always feared a little, and she pulled me into the stairway.
“ Never let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They believe that you are sad and rejoiced that you have reached into you."

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested by a marital board in a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and pulled her offer back, said Miss Schroeder, full of wrath, that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to the President.
“ This was not a well - planned decision, ” she laughed at me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other providers and the last they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name, "White and the seven dwarfs."
Since the election campaign had passed far, she was dependent on the cost of money, so she promised not to offer herself unless she managed to collect two million dollars.
The fight was lost.
She found that some of her supporters gave her $1,000 to men only $250.
“ Do they think that I get a discount? ” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so overcome by feelings - thanks to the people who had supported her, wrath against the system, which made it so difficult to gain money and direct her eyes to the choosers instead of representatives, and anger into the sexual discrimination - that she broke into cry.
“ I might have had a nervous seizure, ” said Ms. Schroeder, remembering how media responded.
“ It could be thought that Cleenex was my strength partner.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my legstone?
"She cryed?"
Reasons for business wars between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the business war between the United States and China were arrogant, and even though the war is far from the end, the intergovernment could be a long - term benefit for Beijing, says experts.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, shot the first warning sentence earlier this year by putting taxes on China’s main export goods, including solar charges, steel and eel.
This week, the largest score came with new customs covering goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds) and taxes up to half of all lips that are transferred to the United States from China.
Peking has replied at the same coin each time and recently charged 5 to 10 percent to U.S. goods to $60 billion.
China has promised to react to the United States’ tax settlement, and it is unlikely that another world’s largest economic system will be abolished.
To get Washington to hope, demands must be given, but it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China, to descend publicly from the United States.
However, experts say that if Peking keeps the cards right, pressure from the US business war could have a positive effect on China for a long time, by reducing the mutual need for both sectors for each other.
“ The fact that either in Washington or in Beijing, a rapid political decision could lead to situations that lead to economic crash in either country, is actually far more dangerous than audiences have previously admitted, ” said Abigail Grace, researcher who focuses primarily on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria “prepared” to return refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the land, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said that the situation in the country would improve.
“ Today, the earth’s situation is steady and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to undergo normal circumstances by building areas destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic decisions against their daily lives and jobs.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million others still in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would like to accept help in rebuilding the country.
On the other hand, he stressed that they would not accept aid depending on conditions or aid from countries supporting the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder cup in Paris
The European Union has won the Ryder cup 2018 by conquering the United States team with the final results of 16.5 versus 10.5 points in the Le Golf National Area outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European basis and has not won Ryder cups in Europe since 1993.
Europe rearranged the crown when the team, under the leadership of Danish leader Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points needed to conquer the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficult races, struck his initial hit in the water at a 16th hole, par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined sharply in all his games and became 1 out of 4 players to get the conclusion 5-0-0, since the competition started using its current profile in 1979.
The United Statesman Jordan Spieth lost 5 + 4 against Thorbjörn Olees from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the series of European players.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who might have played in his last race about the Ryder cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times around the Ryder cup, became the most victorious European race with 25.5 degrees.
“ I usually do not cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that I have chosen and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was pleased to be able to help," said the emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He justified his lands to John Rahm, but he conquered the American Gulf Gospel Tiger Woods 2 & 1 in a lonely game on Sunday.
“ I was incredibly proud of the victory of Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and is now registered with 13-21-3 in the race about the Ryder cup.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who have won 14 big titles and is only in the second place after Jack Nicklaus.
All weekends the U.S. team had hard to find themselves in the field, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a good game through all the races.
Jim Furyk, the leader of the United States, said, “I am proud of them, they fought.
For some time this morning, we pressured Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take it down for Thomasi.
He's a great leader.
All his 12 players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and the Ryder Cup's Committee, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud of being their leader.
You've got to take it off.
They played better than we."
