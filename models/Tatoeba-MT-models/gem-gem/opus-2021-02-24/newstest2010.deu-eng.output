Barack Obama receives the peace nobel prize as the fourth president of the United States
U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the peace nobel prize here as the fourth president of the United States in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over $1.2 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify the world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The Chief of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northern Metropolitan Metropolis and will be busy all the time.
At first, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then arranged a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony where Obama takes over the prize.
He will receive this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan War when he takes the price.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the price as a President who is currently leading war in two countries.
He strengthened the war efforts a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedal, the diploma and the check over ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to donate for well-acting purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitative work.
The event program then provides a banket with the President and his wife, where, apart from the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and other 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very restrainting from the beginning to the price.
For example, he pointed out that he felt that he did not earn the price.
He also repeated several times that it is not only the price for him, except for all who seek the same values as he.
Soon after the notice, he pointed out that this is "request for action" for him.
Natural Protectors are accused of extortion
The Leitmeritz Police accused the Chairman of the Civil Association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for oppression.
In several cases he made appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his calls, he requested money from investors to benefit him, said the Leitmeritz Police Speaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaftist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens him a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sort trash container in Brünn does not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the drink packaging, in the south-maritime villages you will find back on step and step the sorting waste containers.
And in Brünn?
There you have to book a few minutes to find the appropriate waste tones.
I don't want to claim that the waste separation in Brünn would not work at all.
But it seems to me whether the Councillords are taking care of this problem inadequately, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as a citizen are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sort containers, but in particular by the waste tonnes for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the centre to dispose of, for example, the PET bottles in a collective basket?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found until now is the marvelous place toward the gans hit.
Mr Underka should not be angry with his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
Except that waste separation is not honey-swallowing in other parts.
That's why all my friends do not sort the waste at all.
You're stupid.
It is too far from the waste tons.
I don't wonder.
I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles even after the celebration.
But on the Konicova Street, I have not seen any color mollutons in the perspective.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the road.
But the waste almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the brothers' socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us shame in the whole Republic, instead of buying a few waste tones more and offering the sorting of further raw materials for a cleaner well.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after looking for the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the Society of EKO-COM, Brünn is really the worst in the entire district of South Morrow.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness funds
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's views, the budget no longer provides money for pensions, sickness funds and construction savings.
But neither for the government debt rates nor for the international judicial disputes.
This causes more problems that will be with the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists have undergone the increase in salary for some groups, they expect the government to borrow money for sensitive expenditure, age pension or sickness money. "This is just a delay in the problems in the future, laying down mines," says Janota.
The loans pay more and more interest rates, and you have to reimburse the money at some point.
Too much to choose where to take from, the State case is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the State holding, taxes shall be increased.
For all those who the left party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for her children.
In order to benefit from the pensions or the sickness money whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid to get this money.
But at the price that the State is more guilty - in the next year, so in the state case, not only 163 billion is missing, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise as faster as well as the costs and interest rates.
The State will need the money for compensation, and then it will no longer be sufficient to increase VAT slightly or to reduce the maternity money, as the government made in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of monetary decay in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing for the expansion of motorways and railways next year.
This is mainly the sections that are acquired in competition, which can not be re-projected and possibly imagined.
Most of all, what is not free.
This means delay or termination of thirty large buildings, and also threatened is the European monetary system, warns the speaker of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders where the State is owner of the majority, and from it the money is then emitted into the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the height of the dividends is never safe, and it is not infinitely an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion of CEZ flowed into the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is filled up, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the Nieveau of 5.7 per cent GDP according to EU rules.
But this does not end the corneval of the revolutions yet.
Almost three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of Communism and crimes or for expenses for judicial disputes, even for construction.
Whether the State will manage without this money, it is not safe.
That's just a lucky game.
If we lose an international judicial dispute, then we have to pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The Minister must then save the money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two-million project "state cash", which is intended to enable the surveillance of on-line for what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single key.
The plans presented are promising.
It's enough to press only one key, and from Windows Mobile will be switching Android within a few seconds.
Exactly this option wants to introduce the American society VMware, focusing primarily on the development of virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to perform two user profiles simultaneously on your phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work parallelly, indicating Srinivas Krishnamurti from the company VMware at the interview for the magazine computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
Virtualization of the smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully conducted the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM storage, on which simultaneously the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran.
The development of the new mobile telephone technology is in full.
The company VMware is now working together with European and American operators on the smartphone virtualising and to the customer's apparatus will come within 2012.
Stagang on the mountains the hotel owners torment
Scneless pistes not only worry about the giant mountain inhabitants.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter holidays including Christmas and Christmas.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call on us, they immediately ask if our opinion is that this year's Christmas festival will be on snow or "on match", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Anyone who wants to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate to order.
Who prefers saving and where the quality of the stay only comes to the second place, can try to wait for a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for the last day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they also have to give up, and enter into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter holidays always offer the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas Week that is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led by the director of Ingtours Travel Office, Petr Schiefert.
The last day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold averagely.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is no snow in giant mountains.
The people are waiting for snowfall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pistes were cut within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Inverse and a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On Saturday and Christmas we only have a few rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking in Janske Lazne for 80 percent for the holidays.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the giant mountains will certainly rise, led by the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The giant mountains of hotel owners are waiting for a larger snowcut.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
Afterwards, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is Mother of Course
It is almost funny with what students' striving Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself thought was the most stupid.
When he finally swept out his long-declined Afghanistan doctrine, it appeared that he wrote it out of the Busch-Irak scene three years ago.
Not only that the text itself uses the kind of speech "like in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own Declaration: "New Forward" without silence.
He also criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas in the Iraq plagued by the Civil War - as "unresponsible and in its consequences a carastrophic decision".
However, the following months showed that the only possible and very successful bush strategy, which was based on the military recommendations, was that the news on Iraq today has no longer been speaking.
This did not improve the reputation of Bush, because objectively he left his follower a much more grateful starting situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will be repeated.
In order to increase the troop quota, the military again asked him, especially the chief colonel of the Afghanistan Operation, Stanley McCristal, who even despite subordination habits severely criticized the degrading shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation to better.
The President hesitated three months, but hasn't come to a better idea and so he deceived the general with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the assurance for another 5,000, even though it originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic in the entire Obama strategy is his project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctor leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increased increase will have the same effect as the Iraq measure.
Even despite the brotherly war of the past years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by contraindication - no one can trust and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their views every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded correctly, remain only shiny buildings behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistency of relations that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The construction of a "treatable state", which is the minimalistic objective of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizont of the Obama Strategy strange by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
This believes that the small soldiers who have broken out in the war cry about the "return home" here create a miracle can only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date of the decline of the troops is purely irresponsibility because the Taliban will take it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is a reluctance.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hinduchus mountain preland.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation radically is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very difficult question for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period when America is going to Obama for a victory decline from Afghanistan.
But every solution will also mean a dramatic turning of the Afghan situation.
The only comfort plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years until the presidential election remains, so it remains enough time to take a different strategy, if it would prove to be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in bar
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in bar this year.
This has been announced by the company who responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives stocks instead of money, but only in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in case of excessive risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is thus at the top of the efforts to link the premium bonuses of the Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the JPM Organ Society, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made itself a target of criticism, after she had aside almost $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year for premium bonuses.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this year will probably be over $20 billion, according to the Reuters Agency, despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, Britain reported that it intends to charge the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps also prepare France.
In this year, women have won the nobel prizes in all directions, except in physics.
Today, five record wives in Stockholm have taken over the Nobel prizes this year in the category and literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI.
Besides the four scientists, among them was the German writer of Romanian descendant Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their landlord Jack Szostak for research in the chromosone area.
The price for chemistry was received by the Israelite Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for informing the Ribosom structure and functionality.
The last Laureatin granted the Nobel Prize for Economy received by American lady Elinor Ostrom and her landlord Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a nobel prize this year was physics.
Today, the scientists Charles Kao have carried this price for research in the glass fibre area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD Chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prizes has received the diploma, the nobel medals and certification on the acquisition of the monetary price.
It is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several priceholders in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo today afternoon.
In his speech, he recognised the controverss of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the top of the country that is conducting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for fighting world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the retirement. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday early, who thinks of his remaining in the government because he is not agreeing with the implementation of the government budget for the next year in the form that was released by the Assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President speaker, Radim Ogvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, on Monday about his remaining in his function.
According to the budget law,which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should profit with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the Left Party's proposals for monetary revolution and increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from covering the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and Legal Party, on the other hand, there has therefore been a sharp internal-political dispute, which is why the question mark comes on the further work of the Fisher official cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in spring.
Critists claim that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, will practically liquidate the package of savings measures that have been implemented by the fishermen government in the autumn, and that, in its understanding, will end the government's debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the government budget, but does not have to, today, at the morning of discussion with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the "ernstful problem" of "the inconsistent deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only lead to a strong government which could be based on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, argued that the budget is horrible and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words in the editorial group as "strong expressions".
The CSSD CEO, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the deficit was grievous, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and the 200 billion crowns exceeded.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the government budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" of the world shows a lot of the country's fight and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relationships and Nelson Mandela.
The immature fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history of the American Oscar shooter, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the 21-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I'll have to meet you.
The twenty-seven years of actress who had received the price for his role in the Eastwood Drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box area, was already the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which the end became a slave holder, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely one who is still alive and for many people as important as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for 27 years for his active activity at the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeat" and at the same time is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was to speak like him
The film describes a true incident where Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree with the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can party his people through the sports, so he decides to join the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role so to approach them as closely as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was to speak as he did.
The actress said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at evening and be behind the scenes in front of his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take your energy, it's being transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actress said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he first met Pienar in his house.
I remember when I ringed to the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the director of Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety newspaper, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well done film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret dissolved over Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defence Ministry only granted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the start was not successful again and the rocket called the type "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also, his repeated presence on-site at the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has not been started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as about a "raket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, went normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight, there have been technical damage to the missile.
Probably the engine exploded at the third rocket level.
This time "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitrij Donskij, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the shot from the sub-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light that was caused by an unspecified flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Furthermore, the Norwegians have not since the first moment doubted that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has maintained itself this time and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fall out and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Although no test start was made without mistake, the Defense Ministry's leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be successful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfils the generality with optimism and thus continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even ten hypercal atomic heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tonnes will be carried.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov, with 51 years of age, presents itself in a professional ice hockey game.
The former World Champion, Olympician and Stanley Cup owner will help his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and will probably take place on Petersburg in Friday's KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at 40 years, in 1998, is at the time President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulja's injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some other formalities, the Agency quoted the Coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, co-players led up Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice area, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stürmer Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with one and fifty years and was able to benefit 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Gold Medals, seven World Championship titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Iishockey Starroom since 2001.
Hyundai embarked on the trade unions. All overtimes are disappeared
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade unions to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequently assigned overtimes, the trade unions announced the strike preparedness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the automobile factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unions on a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtimes were proposed for the reason that two laps would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work on Saturday.
The employees will also be given afterwards for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take replacement leave for it on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek led up.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday team will be paid the travel money and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtimes of the most urgent and burning point in relation to the demands and complaints of trade unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtimes for the month of December, Vaněk.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after eight hours.
From the signing of the agreement, the strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the managing of the automobile factory and the trade unions will be held on Friday afternoon.
On Wednesday, the trade unions leader, Petr Kuchar, said that if they can agree on the fulfillment of the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to abolish the strike willingness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory was overwhelmed when about 400 employees struck spontaneously because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and claimed slanders.
On the other hand, the management held that the employees had to make the overtimes to meet the requirement for automobile supply.
The trade unions also demanded that the workers who interrupted production on the previous Wednesday would not be penalties.
In the field of overtime, trade unions require to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, this year they demand to pay the fee of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production was started in the company in November last year.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in stolen HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it also acts in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact weighs against the disadvantage that the connection to usual virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the existing medicinal products.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients, however, can prolong their life and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a variety of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction has also resulted in developments such as resistance viruses that are no longer effective against medicinal products.
The work of the experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemic-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
You have shown that the substances referred to as metalocarborane act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are compounds of bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block virus reproduction in different ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists come to new 'enhanced' connections that have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two versatile cages consisting of bore, hydrocarbon and carbon atoms and are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Hometucky and stable virus
HIV protease is protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protein breakdown, no mature virus particles would develop.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also disable the growth of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists in the press report, published by the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemicals of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Science Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically changing.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the test glass, including against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of Metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on resistance variants that the medicinal products used are often inactive to.
The unique mechanism of efficacy and its other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the Metalokarborans interesting links for further development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemicals and Biochemicals and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for budget. ODS started on fishermen who rejected
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year as "growthful" and the government of Prime Ministers of Jan Fischer should consider his further existence.
The Opinion of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
It is supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Mr Necas said that the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on minority in Parliament in the fight against the rising deficit or whether it is his remaining in the office with the links of Parliament.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficit is diametrally different, which Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, with proposals for a change of over 12 billion crown by the Link Party.
Parliament has increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has prevented the proposals of social democracy from covering the budget deficit.
Czech Republic should operate with a residue of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has satisfied the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of ignorance, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer pointed out that the government still judges the current situation.
Necas is convinced that, if Janota had seriously threatened with his withdrawal in the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota has registered to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He suggested that he considers his remains in the office.
That is why he is disappointed over the budgetary supply.
The extent to which fishermen agree for the further fight with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominates of the Social Democracy (CSSD), which had implemented the budget changes, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-sensitive laws, such as those relating to sickness funds and pensions or service laws.
Topolanek: The Minister nominated by ODS did not mistake
This is the matter of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The Ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, people who admit to TOP 09, who voted against the budget, sit in vice-president function.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to abstain from the fight against the deficit height of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that they are based on the left majority, which is currently in Parliament."
Then he claims that he cannot expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this is going to be up to date, I will deal with it, said the Defence Minister Martin Bartak, nominated by the Civil Democrats, to the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council meeting in the afternoon.
The ODS came back at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the Members of the European Democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not reversed in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
Even when I rejected the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be especially about the Bolschewization of Parliament and destruction, Topolanek himself responded positively.
According to the new driving plan of the CD (Czech Railway), less trains will be driven for approximately the same driving price.
The Czech railway ends or limits some less exhausted fast and local trains from 13 December, but other connections are reinforced.
The whole range of transport is reduced by two per cent from the date of validity of the new driving plan compared with today.
Most tariffs including basic and customer carriage are not changed.
For example, several connections to the capital receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The high-speed trip will no longer take to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less speed trains will also be driven on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction in the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, is planned for an increase in Prague and the environment.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week, some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis are reduced.
One of the largest changes is the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, and the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to climb.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electronication from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - main railway station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk/Jesenic will be driven in time of two hours.
With the Pendolino, the passengers have no longer been able to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: a rise of 200 million
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railway total receives for the compensation of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion crowns, as in this year.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and fast trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway commends the system, and it may have not therefore taken action to increase the price of the large majority of tickets.
Changes only occur in day-on-day network tickets CD Net and in favourable Internet carriers eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The eLiska price will then depend on the driven pieces, until now he was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitante arrests more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary schools and their teachers.
This was mentioned by the Agency AFP, which initially informed only about 65 kidnappeds.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
In the province of Agusan del Sur, it came to kidnapping.
Approximately 19 millitants claimed to use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiating leaders are now endeavoring to release the remainder of the hostage.
According to the ACP agency, the millitants are part of the NPA (new-volks army), this is the army fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded vengeance between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the status was imposed on the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which were associated with the election to the governance office, 30 journalists were.
As a result of suspected participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippinian province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan Clan, were arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separaters are also active.
However, those who restarted peace negotiations with the Philippinian government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the Unbeaten" which includes part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-familiar fighter against the apartheid has been given Morgan Freeman, who was claimed to have been audienced by Mandela itself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
The film's film start will also make critics' reactions as well as public reactions.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, then in 1993 with the Klerk the Peace Nobel Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put in the movie because it comes into the cinemas in a time where, on the one hand, the preparations for the world championship are culminated in South Africa, but at the same time the media are shocking the world's publicity with alarming news about the rising race hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants since the black dominant majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood Stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film after his own words.
I've been doing this role for many years and I've prepared well for it.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as you say, I could get his energy, he was in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality with this movie and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it relates to every human being, he supplemented.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book leaflet of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated'In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united portrays the South African defense of human rights during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to gather together two race and for the year and day, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the world cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby Address, which then won South Africa.
For the entry of the breed in the dress, almost as a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested fourteen years ago large ovals, mainly by the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may do it to join the people again into a single people, leading the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves, that will only appear.
But the White South Africans are skeptical, such as in a recent interview for LN of the Rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
Burn transformers in the Louny area for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out at the transformer of the Society Ceps at the switching system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area in the morning.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the district fire force Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the fire force wanted to burn out the transformers, but later they changed their view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special waste materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer cordlock.
Nobody was injured, Havariy did not jeopardize the security operation of the management system, according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage has been estimated to be several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will not be counted until after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps society has not done anything similar, errors of this kind are rare, supplemented it.
The power supply was not interrupted in accordance with the Speaker of the Society of CEZ for North Böhmen, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the trafostation did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is operated in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the management system, the electrical pipelines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It enters, renovates and develops 39 switches with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to distribution system and direction lines with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises punishment for blasphemy against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the student agency, Radim Jancura, is today raising punishment for slander against three socially democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moweren, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute non-view in the radio journal.
The complaint is linked to the company's effort to operate regional transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take the rosines out, and we have only submitted the offer to the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So nothing remains for us but to defend us.
Due to this blasphemy of the Society Student Agency, Jancura said to the radiojournal.
At the same time, he argued that he had evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an accusation for the European Commission.
Hasek believes that the collection of the penalty advertising is the continuation of the medial show by Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I assume that in this case it will also become clear that it is Jancura, who manipulates the public in the case of regional railway transport and uses false and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million crowns in the advertising, which will point to the disadvantaged step of the districts.
He said to the radiojournal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura, after the districts agreed on regional rail transport with the Czech railway and had not announced tenders for the order at a height of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we do not fail to lose the bus licenses as well.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radiojournal today.
vaccination against pneumococks free of charge and voluntary
Impression against pneumokocks changes the usual from January.
It is supposed to be the first for the families free and voluntary.
But now votes are now reporting that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
culminate the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococks.
The Medicines Institute already determines the maximum prices of the vaccines to be paid by health insurance.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Impacts free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals, which were born on August 2, last year and later.
The condition that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Those who have already started the vaccination last year or earlier have to pay further repetition vaccination themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th life month of the child.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccined against pneumococcos last year.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance is spending 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for the vaccination doses.
However, they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
To date, the State has spent about 500 000 per year for all the area vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcs cause median ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill us after study in hospitals a year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcos was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be obligatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
From January it is intended to be paid by insurance and voluntarily.
For example, that the obligation vaccination would be better mentioned by the Head of the Nahlas Civil Association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has already served for pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with our voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in implementing this at least.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The Chairman of the Special Society of Practical Children's physicians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, you could think about the reduction in the number of repeat vaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer," Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to inject their infants against pneumococcos from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcals is also causing it to be paid as the first area vaccination by the health insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should spend the money for prevention in order to save them for further treatment, Cabrnochova disfellowshipped.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is a concern of the practical child doctors who are concerned with the purchasing of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccins should be purchased by insurance and then the doctors should receive them on the same way as other vaccins issued by the State to them.
Some Members, however, feared that insurance could "explode the money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance pays them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son is involved in "museum steal"
The son of the famous American Fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was invited 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It says that Frank Frazetta junior and another man would have used a bagger to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of designs such as Conan of Barbar and Tarzan.
The news agency Associated Press reported that at the time of the event in Florida, the artist held up.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feast.
The agency reported, according to a police prosecution, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father, "that he should penetrate into the museum with all the means to bring all paintings into a camp."
The Agency informed Frank Frazetta Senior that he had given any permission.
Labour defends increases in employment and taxes
Ministers have defended the increases in taxes and expenses that have been announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had given an opportunity to "switch" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The tax Chancellor was also provided for the purpose of targeting workers with low and medium income.
One of its main proposals is a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% cup limit of public salary accounts for 2011.
Social security disorders
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low wage receivers are punished for a recession which they have not caused and warned against the "problems" that are coming.
The increase in social insurance - approximately 3 billion UK pounds per year - has irritated the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the attention should be focused on economic recovery.
The increase limited to those who earn more than 20,000 £ per year will affect approximately 10 million workers.
SCHWARPUNCTS OF THE VORAB ETATREGEL
Increase in social insurance by more than 0.5 % from April 2011
In this year, the economy is shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on banking bonuses
1 percentage increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax releases for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the tax office, a person with an annual income of 30,000 £ by 90 £ per year will be poorer and a person with 40,000 £ per year will be poorer by 190 £, while a person with 10,000 £ annual income will be richer by 110 £.
The Ministers said that their goal of deficit halving meant "threate decisions" by 2013, but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall from the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms contradicts that the sketched tax increases and expenses stops in comparison with the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half-life and this is also essential for the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions on future economic growth – which affects the scope of the new debt and the speed of the deficit transfer – were questioned after the tax creditor was forced to review previous figures.
In his opinion, he said that the economy will probably decrease by 4.75% this year - much more than the decline of 3.5% that was predicted in April - while the debt would be more than £3 billion than it was estimated in advance.
"The Missed Occupation"
The conservatives who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "debt crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years would be inconsistent.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan to repay this and to press "zynic" before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You have said nothing important about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do so, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour maintains that schools, hospitals and police are preserved from future reductions, unlike in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit deterioration coming faster and more quickly.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argues that the plans are "based on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the notifications, such as the above inflation adjustment in some invalid pensions in April, the tax cancellant would suspend the assumption of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour continues to provide extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Höhler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any state details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public expenditure will only be applied in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Examination said that the numbers of the tax creditor would mean strong declines in many areas, possibly in the future also in the fields of transport, university education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are only made after the choice, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to the business audit company Deloitte.
"This was just the hole pre-etat report. The markets recognize that."
FBI examines "Festilings of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported US citizens due to the suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab Province, the American Embassy in Pakistan informed the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether these are the same men that were reported missing last month in the U.S. State of Virginia.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are to be Pakistani, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a Jemenite background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are held," said speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was connected with the families of missing students.
"We work with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay there, if it are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistan message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no accusation has yet been made against the men arrested.
The news agency Reuters reported that foreign minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States must "more cooperate with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "Miss practices" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "misuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of his human rights balance.
Official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedschad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and killed, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens of people received penalties and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC-Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognised some of the abuse claims and ordered the closing of the Kahrizak Traffic Institute.
But since then there has been no tolerance for criticism by the authorities, our correspondent said.
False confession
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of the "work with Facebook networks" and of the protest against the election results.
"They struck me in the face more often," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, informed Amnesty.
The beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and rape others.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape claims, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others over eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the courts had set up a committee to examine the disturbances after the election and the reactions of the government, but Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to transform a sign into Bristol into a race piste.
The shippers of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prices.
On the top of the hanging in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jumper at the beginning of a 100 meter long hanging.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the hill, but it was also quite frightening.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were granted for the best pieces of art exported on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still her and us
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a minarette construction ban and the concern about the supposed isolation of Europe has been widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a foundated and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared secularized societies in Europe.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love headwear" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and dense study of a question that the country shared and was occupied with, and whose effects are still being seen today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and cozy spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in this area.
He has spent months in Mosques, schools and institutes, now offering the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamic Freespaces".
He is a good listener, he presents debates between teachers and students on the questions they are most worried about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a council house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a sense-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly proficient matters, he claims to be the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that the media are dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Arab-Muslim scholar and academic who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the one hand, a good national in a modern secular society.
You don't have all arguments on their side.
Conservatives are distrusted with the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly unanimous with their salafi contests – the puristic sunitian Islam, associated with Saudi Arabia – who presently show a small but powerful presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions whether French political actors (and the intellectual elites, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a roarer treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who, on their part, had to make their historic compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "sharpness of values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most disastrous view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and dramaticer than any other environment region on earth.
The ice that she marks smelts with an alarming speed and takes life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, maritime and fisheries interests have entered open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (Original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the north, of the ice bear.
In the complex history and politics of the whale, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old fahnrich to the lake, who struggled only with the gun bulb of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught while swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought into Zoos and circusses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears at an idea.
Even today, zoa plants still typically have a millionthing of the lives of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore became very green by the algae that grows in the hollow hairs of his fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often turns back to the threat that the hunters represent for survival of the species.
Despite the prohibition in Norway, America and Russia, the construction in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding inuit use powerful storm guns to bring their prey to the line.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the ice" (Original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the Arktis science and a packing insight on how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can explain the speed of changes properly.
But that is not a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneering trips of Fredtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century were the first time to see the confusion of the packaging.
In the Cold War, subsea boats are the moving grasses when departure.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large-scale distribution of measuring signals on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people who are fighting outside in the cold.
Anderson looks into the strange, small world of the influencing system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by salt water rinsals, which are collapsed in the freezer.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopical small miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when once the summer ice goes away, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, that could be We."
Marine infants were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington cranes.
De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infants, who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women who walked in their footsteps.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester Wreath Company, in Harrington, Maine, found this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife, Karen, who are doing this trip every year, in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a commonly useful organization, Wreaths Across America (cranes throughout America), which also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the battery park in New York and at the memory site for the United Airlines airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 for purchase and transport of cranes for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she took her journey to Arlington in her memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return something to those who brought victims.
She said that is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave place.
Packed in layers of warm clothing the volunteers walked across the widespread grass surfaces and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War 1 and 2 and Vietnam War as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organisers said.
The mood was happy, children played, and couples kept on their hands while wearing the fresh jaws to the grey tombstones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where most of the war wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the darker mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individual crying openly, others prayed, and families and friends stuck together in the ice air.
Some read the names painted in stone, while others bow down to small black and white square cards that had been placed for those in the moist mud whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who forgot bitter tears before her son's grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of marine infrastructure sub-officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government arrested a contractor of the US Government who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, which was not yet identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with seat in Bethesda.
The Society is working on projects for customers, such as USAID, the U.S. consultants for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. stakeholders in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific accusations have not yet been published, although a Cuban national or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost everything under the accusation of "hazard".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, save a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community that is mentioned by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested an authorisation to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will probably increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama Government, which had sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday.
The new US policy is important to the United States to make a return when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used today for sending text messages, since a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are restricted.
On Cuba the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in jail in Cuba are sitting in prison for crimes like drug smuggling behind grids, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US Interest Representation in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about arrest.
The arrest and arrest are obviously wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the issue of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently delivered a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", an announcement on the official establishment of Raul Castro as the leader of the country who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the prosecutors were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move together for more dialogue.
Pakistani government representatives cover the plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldaten, and said that they hope that this case could help to discover an extensive network of terrorist advertisers seeking the Internet for radical young men.
Investigators said that they had searched for an opposing, known as Saifullh, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had submitted comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to submigrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the irregular mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refugee.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
Therefore they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged at all and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani penalty authorities.
The case of five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being consulted by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of applicants in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in the decision who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of urgency to spend human asset posts within Al Kaida.
The respondents of the organization act as princes who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
A Kaida is subject to a special test, analytists said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda values, they are also considered to be extremely attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analysiser of the NEFA Foundation with its headquarters in the United States, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they have allowed access, because the US secret services have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you try to put someone in these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrations in Copenhagen demand climate-"Action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets and demanded more cozy action in climate protection from the retailers in the Bella Congress Centre of the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, but the police estimates were rather out of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city centre.
On one day when the climate negotiations supported by the UN were little, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparents on which there was "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the country of birth of her mother, make her aware of the heartwarming problems that the country has to face because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - in order to extend the word and appeal to the world leaders to achieve a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no longer a way around it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought bag knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned because he was involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing burned several explosive bodies near the main channel of Copenhagen, in the vicinity of several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as a light missile, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
Within the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems to have not reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international thoughts, he answered in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
Then he went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the event is large, I can't hear what happens outside."
He found that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the focus of the broad public and of various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disturb negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show hard-needed racial air
The evidence for mathematics performance were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the schools of the country that produce the highest performance, the evidence shows that the four- and eight-classmen have made faster progress in the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the hard-taking performance gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
The average score of the white four-classes from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), which increased only by three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance gap grew from 2007 to 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Eight Claims remained essentially the same, it fell around a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample size was not sufficient.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap, which separated white and black fourth clothes in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by children of both groups has grown in this period, the difference has hardly decreased by 58 points now.
Some educational advocates of the district expressed their concern last week about the fact that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, most of white students who are already powerful children, were advanced.
This indicates that we have raised the overall evaluation by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the Board of Directors of D.C. Voice, a commonly useful group who enters for educational equality in Washington D. C.
I do not jump up and down for a tension of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Basic School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of test points is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what scares me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy that we should use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poor students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new lecture plan, the Wilson Reading system, aimed at students in the upper secondary school and middle school, which have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their classmates.
Daily mathematics, a educational plan that brings out of the children's garden to the sixth class of games and life-sensitive experiences, was brought to Washington under the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey, and this teaching plan is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to benefit the best measures for students under the level of note, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for poor schools that need to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examined urban examination results.
The conventional medicine is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political consequences that work against this important item of the agenda.
The weakness is, of course, as with other urban inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the urban districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the Charter Schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher unions last year over 185 days a year, which he considered as "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
High-level training for more people than future prospects
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pie.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 steps out and flashes a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brickstones and the smaragd green grass.
Graciela's parents hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was held in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eight-classmen of the group who explore Gettysburg, where the lesson costs $38.690 per year, were rather the one of an awesome visitor than the one of a enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had entered the building for science.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was reported the low professor-to-study relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have taken the intended message fully: The question is not whether you go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants, who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands of people who receive college education that is needed to rise into the middle layer.
In fact, one out of five of the "second generation" of Hispano Americans ends the college – which is a remarkable performance, since many of their immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, says researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour forces of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and a inhabitant motive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence with American schools.
However, advisory programmes also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially when these efforts continue for a longer time.
If you look at income weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them search through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time,” said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who examined hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that Gracielas' college tour financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turn up a hallway - and provides over 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income weak students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Education Department, the programme has helped more than 10 million students from which more than 60% have gone to college since 1999.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil Contracts concluded with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares of two of the 10 hidden fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has given a commandment has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields covered in June.
The thin seeded representatives of American oil multiply in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, Iraq has finally opened its gates and, instead of US companies, introduce Asian and Europeans the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, a online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still underlined by massive co-ordinated bombardements on Tuesday and political instability by the deduction of the US military probably prevented American oil companies, said analytists to be more engaged in Iraq, which has the third largest proven raw oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, in particular Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and risks because they do not have to discharge shareholders.
Exxon Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been sided with technical advice in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players at two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the Speaker of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the greats of the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure with its companions and fulfil its obligations to Iraq.
For pre-selected companies, commandments were made, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the Ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the case of an obvious US missile attack along the Pakistani border to Afghanistan, this week, a top action plan for Al Kaida was supposed to have been killed, reported representatives of the US terrorist fighting on Friday.
This would be, if it would be confirmed, the second fatal attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities, were supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles who met their vehicle near Miran Shah on Tuesday in the province of North Wales.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's illegal tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a government representative of a Pakistanian civil secret service from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Local residents who were suspected of belonging to the military ran to the place and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorist combating led to uncertain evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planer of Al Kaida, who led the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy throughout the world, noticed a leader who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate character of US air attacks on Pakistani ground.
It also includes the planning of attacks on the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali had quickly risen in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second government representative, but this does not at all reduce the danger that he represented for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader, who has been killed since September, when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The rate of attacks by drones of the CIA has since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a common organization, decreased from a average of six operations per month to two.
The decline can be based on improved terror group tactics that have taken steps to reduce their attackability and at the same time kill brutally in suspect informants, reported the page.
Leading UN Sender in Kabul will withdraw
On Friday, the leading United Nations Messenger in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would retire from his office in March, resulting in a stormy period of office that was suffered by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
There is an oath departure when the Obama government has decided to send another 30,000 US solar data to Afghanistan.
The UN Messenger said that he supports the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concerns about the fact that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghanes that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help in the political change of Afghanistan.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not settle down his office, but only fulfilled an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the UN notification.
Now forward Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a follower, said oath.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he has recently led the UN mission in Bagdad and considered the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who has previously led UN peace operations.
Eeds position in Afghanistan was tested after his former alternate, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and to hide evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "had undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great measure of skepticism regarding international interference in the election".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative in order to coordinate the aid measures of American armies in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his follower to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his powers in Afghanistan and said that the immense UN setting arrangements have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I was able to set up only one person.
It's disastrous and it's not allowed to go on this way.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
The Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon "relevant additional sanctions" on Iran because he has not participated in discussions about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 US Soldaten in Northern Iraq during a seven-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in response to the question of a soldier about the probability of such development.
"One of the things that are on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the war's own unpredictability."
The Obama Government considers a package of sanctions aimed at the Iranian military and political elites, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average irons.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is required to "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected by nuclear weapons" because "your people will suffer unheartedly" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion of the White House speaker, Robert Gibbs, the US Government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if he does not meet the requirements of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with his nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be acquired for peaceful purposes only.
In conversations in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would reopen the discussions to limit his nuclear programme and would abstain from a major part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US Government has pressed on this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have abandoned negotiations on the provisional agreements - partly, experts say, because the Irish leadership disagrees whether they should be committed to the United States.
The fact that Iran left the international community in relation to some of the proposals which they had already agreed at the beginning of October has, openly said, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chineses, in a way that they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama set on 31 Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he will continue to pursue other options, including those which the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "expressive sanctions".
In a opinion issued in New York, the Iranian representation of the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "on groundless and unfounded claims" of some Security Council members on the Iranian nuclear activity and said that they are willing to continue conversations with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially with regard to borders, ownership rights and the breakdown of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential of conflict to prevent delays in US plans to reduce American troops from 115.000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disperse the Kurdish concern about the coming troop deduction. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government: "We will receive your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A course change in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up with propaganda placates that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have been so well learned that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer by the low birth rate and the older population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was direct and final: "In no case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31th, a personnel manager with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single-child politics in China, the two generations of notorically thick, dependent single children, which are lovingly called "small emperors", raises a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate was 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time of the entry into force of this policy, the United Nations
The population issue department is determined, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 will rise from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosively by 2050, which is far above the global average of approximately 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-old and older almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants Shanghais have been present, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of Shanghaier City Population and Family Planning Comission, said that pairs in the age of production need to have babies to "help to reduce the ratio of older population shares and to reduce the shortage of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A Gradually Relaxing
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial that has been introduced by the prevailing Communist Party until today.
Pairs who violate this policy must expect huge penalties - up to their threefold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese government representatives have attributed to this policy that the critical demand for natural national resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural regions, some officials who have already had a child have forced to abort.
Many couples also had sexual abortions, resulting in an unusually high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards single-child politics.
In 2004 they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including urban inhabitants, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007 the sound of many hard slagans was degraded.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, to allow couples to have two children with a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which started an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Plakats that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by directives that describe detailedly who is in question for a second child and how to apply for authorisation.
The city administration has sent local employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not really encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing Reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outside of Shanghai said that a rise in the applications of pairs who want a second child after the campaign starts, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with an inhabitant of 115.000, there are still only four to five applications per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghaier officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165.000 – slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghaier municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was legally allowed.
But they have, how many Chinese, only a small sickness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely assess one-child politics as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, they're robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their delays.
Wang, the personnel manager, said she wanted only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to see everyone cared for us.
We are not accustomed to taking care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Sieian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblemished.
For parents from the middle state with double career, through which the birth rate declines, he said, it turns to be successful and you must be selfish.
The age group of today's 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want to live for themselves, he said.
A single child too, he said, makes huge requirements to the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one who has reached a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UN Group drafts plan for emission reduction
The UN's Climate Conference - which has hitherto been awarded by wild poses and mutual accusations - has set a focus again on Friday with the publication of a document, which will record an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, whereby industrial nations will have to train the largest burdens in the near future.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered to be an important progress in a negotiation that ends the time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text formulated by a UN working group specially designed for this purpose is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can overcome global warming in short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large threshold countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise that the political decision-makers would contribute.
The process will be given a great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, the leader of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiation text to put the focus on what the leading UN Climate Protection Representative, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the basic rise of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Community has also given the discussions on Friday an incentive by its assurance to provide over the next three years $3.6 billion per year to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
However, the Friday brought the same verbal fireworks, which had been determined by the conversations in the last week.
The U.S. Climate Special Agent Todd Stern has rejected formulations which require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger threshold countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China as representative of the Bush Government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign any agreement without taking up larger threshold countries and taking measures, so star who also complained that the text is not far enough, ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders.
Star delivered his opinion an hour after the Chinese Vice-Organist He Yafei declared that the leading American climate dealer lacked either "the reason" or it was "most irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not financially help China to master global warming.
The future economic direction of the great world powers in danger has opened breaklines both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the threshold countries.
The current struggle also refers to the salvation of individual economics, as well as to the salvation of the planet, where China and the United States are concerned about their related obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two thousand most influenced countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken more aggressive action to take account of the countries with very high greenhouse gas tax for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominion, such as Ulate, who is also active as a regional Climate Adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to the effects of climate change argued that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will lead to a political agreement in the best case.
The Alliance of the small island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft agreement on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states "exercises political pressure on the entire political process", partly because they are now united and demand measures from the threshold countries, such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions still need to be clarified before the arrival of the government leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, departed from their planes and rusted through the loops of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, in order to stop claims that are negotiated during the next week.
The pure size of the assembly -- 13.000 people go in and out daily in the Congress Centre, guitar-playing activists organise nightly shows where they make fun of the countries that they believe are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are hand-to-hand instead of by email -- are already a challenge.
The intensity is just based on: almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Organisation Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
United Kingdom's first 225 km/h faster train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pee will penetrate the darkness to announce an award tour that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed railway in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras on his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, and place 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then join Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin pendel service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will finally connect faster, reliable trains to an international rail network and will connect the large balloon areas of the Midland, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendler cities, working hours would be drastically reduced and the change of aircraft and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and the steady state on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
However, the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battles and fears of environmental damage could still draw the brakes in the British high-speed glues.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis, according to the Times, will submit the report on 30 December.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line that London wants to connect to the West Midlands will pass by with a five-metre playspace in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed grid network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route which would lead a single high-speed route to the West Midlands.
The route would be divided into or near Birmingham and a departure would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said an railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part line that would not be opened before 2025 would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today something over an hour.
The drafts offer the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest of Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would, on the other hand, mean that there would be a need for an end station in London, on which 20,000 travellers could be completed per hour.
In view of the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued, but the long-term public advice and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
First, the trains had to switch from high speed routes to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is regarded as a decisive stop point in order to ensure a switch from the plane to the railway, a direction for the rail revolution.
Tax payers come up for mortgage for 75,000 pounds of a conservative orange
Alan Duncan, the leading underhouse member of the conservatives, took account of thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an orange that he was building in his living house in his electoral circle.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron because he complained about the need for under house members to live "of softer rations" has increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds in order to be able to build an oak wood craft cultivation on his second house in Rutland.
He allowed the taxpayer to take account of the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The supervisors of the underhouse approved the applications at the time and they were not also questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, which carried out a review of the expenditure of the underhouse members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not have been "not cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest under house members, has a two-stage house in a village in its district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, an expense control point of the underhouse, agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited to comment on an increase in the money acquisition during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee informed him last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of more than 271,406 pounds (EUR 300,000) from his London House to his electoral circuit house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as parliamentary member.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received some 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest rate until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, indicating that the total increase in the funding of EUR 75,000 was EUR (85,000).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate decreased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it is still standing.
The latest documents published by the underhouse show that Duncan continued to claim its right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post as the opposition leader of the underhouse in September after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the expense scandal that parliamentarians would live "of thiner rations".
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live by thicker rations and how S*****e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden, and I have the right to a disappearing small part, measured by what belongs.
And I could have asked the whole damn sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, a millionaire from his former career as an oil larger dealer, was first attacked in May for his expenditure, when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fees Office that this could be considered as an exaggerated demand.
An activist in Duncan's grass as a protest has buried a hole in the form of a pounds mark after it has been known that he had invited 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned yesterday night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Add to the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about excavation and snatching or a curse of rules or similarities.
Everything is completely transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all your believers to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December with Christmas songs as topic.
The event started on December 1, and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cabin every day from 17:30 to 18:30 at free glue wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits.
The currently selected Christmas songs are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cabin decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and Head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize enthusiastic celebrations.
The idea of the beach cabinet advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on combating climate heating, where the police have committed several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundred thousand according to the organisers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to an end until Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to showing that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators dressed entirely in black clothing, windows with patches and hammers had crushed, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-World Polices have intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimate, were mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent splitting groups that had already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, arrested in the east of France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the demonstration organisers, has caught the conditions under which hundreds of militant attendants have been arrested "without discernment", sharply criticized, and has underlined that some hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and seat position.
The more peaceful train was taken by Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to be able to welcome the spokesmen planned for one evening with candle light, taking part by the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators are busts and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, and some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue rain coats, have made a first rise in the morning in Copenhagen, since you have followed the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue times" for the "climate justice".
Today we go to the streets to demand a recovery of the ecological debt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, the Philippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue this way and say that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, water runs where you can walk, as was never the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics approached to environmental organisations.
The European Commissioner José Bové, the shape of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climage Rights and Social Rights": "Now there are no differences between the fight against climate heating and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific Area, where many islands are particularly threatened by heating, has given the start-up for demonstrations.
According to the Australian organisers, about 50,000 people have gone on the streets.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, mostly students who have marched in red and have hunted bandanas in which you have celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, some hundred demonstrations took place to demand a powerful approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
In Geneva, some people have gathered together.
The separatist Abchazia chose its president, Georgia denounced that this is a "strip".
Abchazia chose its President on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognised this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as its own, deunified Tbilissi the "strook".
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control over the south-Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area recognised by Russia.
The election rooms closed at 17 a.m. GMT.
The election participation was approximately 58% a few hours before the closure of the elections, according to the Abchasian Electoral Commissioner.
The first previous results should be announced in the night of Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous President Serguei Bagapch, are categorically rejecting the idea of a reunification with Georgia which condemns the election.
These choices are a farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saachvili, regrets that Abchazia is now under Russian security total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognised the self-employment of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world sees it as part of Georgia, dasillegal occupied by Russia.
After distinguishing from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, thousands of people died, Abchazia wants to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Quartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the choosers who went to choose in an electoral room that was in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch is seen along the side of the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, that is located in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the execution of elections.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abchazia's self-sufficiency.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition on their part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements that were concluded with Moscow last year, as those in Abchazia Russia leaves control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the choice.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second election round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated every Saturday around the world to demand an ambitious and binding Treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have arrested some 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundred thousand, according to the organisers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrators have stopped about 500 meters from the centre and have not tried to intervene.
A stage was built to welcome the spokesmen planned for one evening with candle light, taking part by the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were dressed entirely in black and armed with backstones and hampers began to insert discs, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-World Polices have immediately circumcised you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and made it clear that it is mainly members of the Black Blocs, these extremely violent splitting groups that have already been famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening a police officer suffered an injury to the cheek during the incidents, according to the police, about twenty persons were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in control," explained the police speaker, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of order forces cries in the air.
Most demonstrators who traveled by rail or by their own vehicle from German large cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue rain coat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, representing the "Blue Seas" for "Climage Right".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the south," explained the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell ourselves anymore, we have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that decorate, there are water runs that you can run through, which was never before the case."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was introduced in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation opposed to environmental protection organisations has approached.
The French Member of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové explained to AFP that he was coming to Copenhagen to "combine climate rights and social justice." "There is no longer a difference between the fight against heating and the fight for another world today."
The organisation Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific space, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to the heating of the earth, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the words of the organisers, about 50,000 people have gone on the road.
In Manila, some hundreds of people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, before the city management of the philippine capital for solar energy have advertised.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organised by the "Net of 350" several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered together in Geneva.
The facts geography and history, according to Chatel, are strengthened by the school reform of Lycéen.
In an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the National Minister for Education, Luc Chatel, explained that the fields of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of Lycées, even if they are not compulsoryly instructed in the terminals (12 school years).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) have now every four weeks and the same program," confirmed Mr Chatel.
For the minister "must overcome this shiny holiness," because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "the best student".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued, underlined: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who had been upset about the lack of historical and geographical education in the terminals on technical lycees."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticized the state project to terminate obligatory education in history and geography in the Terminale S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also blamed this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
On the other hand, the minister answered that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the Terminals S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called to protest on Tuesday to the project, which they believe are the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister argued that at the beginning of the year, in Master 2 (M2), they were subject to a professional qualification test and at the end of the year of an approval audit to which their qualifications are examined.
They also conduct practices during the year in the M2 and then teach the students as a teacher in the practitioner.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before performance testing, you will reach more hours that you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister explained that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "a matter that does not exist in human education."
He once again confirmed that he wants to remove the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieure"
Fiveteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen Summit : this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", had to tackle on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP found, the peace nobel prizemaker Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences at which experts would turn to the audience every fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to reach the people, and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old, and one of the organisers today, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event is based on the name that the students have given to the fish in the basin of the school.
"Below the experts, the twenty participants were selected, even after their charisma," he explained.
"For climate heating, you can speak for hours. However, the core goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke only freely with films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined in the hope that the listeners may conclude that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on a absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos played by these conferences will be found online from 15 December on the page of the school.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will then take place every two months.
Payment delay : wrathful prison guards, actions planned
The trade unions of criminal officials called on a general day of action on Friday to achieve the transfer of premiums and overtimes whose payment was suspended for budgetary reasons until January before Christmas.
The second trade unions of penal officials ("FO-Pénittiaire") called on employees who do not have any service to demonstrate on Tuesday tomorrow before the penalty institute and block them in order to pay attention to the "theft of what is to them".
The third trade unions of penal officials ("CGT-Pénittiaire") called on to "combine a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surpluses, and the Sunday and holiday surpluses in December are burned as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first trade unions of criminal officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "general mobilisation (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the penalties and the Ministry of Justice declared that the overtimes have increased significantly in 2009 and not all of them in the budget, but they guarantee that the remainder of the claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice informed in the evening, Michèle-Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of criminal officers guaranteed that the payment would be done next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernise our punishment system," the Minister of Justice informs us in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the penalty enforcement agency to take immediate measures in order to avoid repeating in the future a situation that has arisen from the lack of assessment of the overtime incurred," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is smaller, except for the management staff who enjoy high service and target premiums, the UFAP/UNSA explains for which the "budgetary narrowings" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," resents the interregional trade unions FO in Marseille and announces "all congregations and calls" to boycott up to new instructions.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and holidays when the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtime," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more responsibilities are being awarded without more staff, the attempt to enrich the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the CGT Association of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is unfair, found by the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama thinks he distributes Christmas ever better gifts than he gets himself.
The U.S. President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has spoken out at the TV speaker Oprah Winfrey that he shares better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast that was rayed over the ABC Channel on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight on how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the small four-bone companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog is given a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims on the quality of gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nailed the president.
"So please," he swore them slimly and pointed to the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an uncontrolled atmosphere with the well-known TV modernist who supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts that they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-round bicycle and also a basketball that his father, which he rarely saw, had brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"Not until much later in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't even know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL confirms that he was moved into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for significant "injury" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated in Los Angeles from Wednesday to Thursday in the Cedars Sinaï Hospital, after the American doctors had discovered "injury due to the operation of a band disc incident" that he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, so his production company in Paris, which added that these injuries had required a new operation.
However, the producer company of the singer wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid "power and complications".
However, only after 48 hours, a little more sure about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, added RTL.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither confirmation nor comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources it appears" that after its first operation in Paris "nonely dranage" was placed.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a band disc incident.
The action planned for several days was conducted by neurochirurg Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday for comments to RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered on Monday at the Cedars Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a subsequent infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, thought to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that "no concern" was needed to make the rock musician because this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him that it would be insane to put yourself in a plane for twelve hours after such a operation, which wouldn't go so," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is inhibited".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the woman of the singer, and he had no particular concern.
Yet, the concern for the singer’s health has grown since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he was falling on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small intestinal cancer-OP" which led to a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented greatly. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer had efforts on the stage to move.
Only in mid-November, the surrounded persons had to demente a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Curzbahn: First place for Bousquet about its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, a three-fold medal winner at the 2009 swimming world championships, received an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the shortway in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn surprised over 4 x 200 m lies and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m lags of the men.
Shade for Bousquet, who wanted to take the world record at 50m free style, whose record he holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two kingly distinctions in swimming, 50m free style, the 28-year-old French claimed to be in 20,53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russians Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in increasingly greater and in this case I have said that if the world record is in my scope, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epos in Istanbul, which began for the first time in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination has not been paid for the German Paul Biedermann, two-fold world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and World Record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m free style (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
USA : Grab plate at Zola estimated to 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million on Thursday, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been rated with $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architectural decoration, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday compared to the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is with certainty what the buyers have mostly offered for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the family Borghese at home, then she appeared in piece for piece at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and found it in Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
In searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "erve of Emile Zola" which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's Trip from Honduras towards Mexico has been misleaded
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the disrupted Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to homeland as no longer compatible, after the Push Government had rejected it as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place in the night, everything seems to suggest that the possibility of carrying out this transfer is different, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, declared.
According to the Immigration Authority, the plane submitted by the Mexican Government, which was arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its place of origin.
The Putsch government wanted to need M. Zelaya for "drawn" and ask for political asylum for him abroad.
However, the disrupted President refused to return to Mexico as the most welcome, official Head of State.
The Putsch regime "had experienced a new failure by trying to move me to give up on my expenses (...), they wanted me to resign," said M. Zelaya on Thursday to Radio Globo, where he often reports on his words since the beginning of the political crisis that has been held in the Middle American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, and the disrupted President, who had fled into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, added under attacks of some accordes.
The Mexican message presented a request to us for guidance, which we cannot accept, however, because it did not contain asylum, had explained to the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Inner Minister of Putsch Government.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible journey from Honduras, he had underlined, he would only do as president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of M. Zelayas had mobilized the attendants of the devastated president, who had opened up to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, so that the military had strengthened its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch Government.
This, according to its assessment, revealed the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was suspended on June 28, on the day of the referendum's referral to his re-evaluation, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on September 21 and had fled into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he will be imprisoned for high deceit, whose law accuses him, says the Putsch government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to resolve M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo had been recognized by the United States during the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the cogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to the office until the end of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in the rise, the US trade balance nourishs optimism
The New York Stock Exchange concluded on Thursday with a high level, the figures of the American trade balance show a course recovery of the US shares and their partners: Dow Jones has by 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
Due to the numbers at stock closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was attributed to 1.102.35 points by 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anectic under the prerequisite that the market focuses solely on "half-full glasses", so it corrected.
Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners is based on the figures of the American trade balance, which "have an improvement in the activity in the fourth quarter".
In October, the US trade deficit decreased by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in relation to September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the goods export, which reflects the economic growth of the United States' main trade partners, said Christopher Cornell by the company research Economy.com.
On the contrary, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474 000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers during the last four weeks was "fall to the depth of the year", stressed Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of State bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% from the beneficiary, the profitability of bonds to 30 years to 4.492% compared to 4.408% from the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of partizanes standing in power peep out "dames in Weiss"
Some hundreds, on the Thursday Thursday, on Cuban power, have exposed the wives gathered in Havana for the purposes of the world's human rights day by political prisoners and also disregarded another advertisement, because of which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
In order to exhort the 40 "Damen in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, on open streets of partyzanes of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the footmarch in the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Solder!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!" the powered partyes scanned with a lifted fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who appeared to "protect their protection".
Similar demonstrations against the "Damen in Weiss" had taken place in Havana in the early evening, where neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissidents who also opened the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights were temporarily arrested by civil policemen, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents of the government in civil vehicles that were embossed by the parties of the government under violence.
The temporary imprisonment of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As adversaries of the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" have organized an unauthorized march for the "Bitte for release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to dissident list, has some 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is sitting in prison for 20 years.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of the 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, from which 53 are sitting behind grids to date.
The Cuban authorities feel the opponents of the regime as "sellers" or "agents" in the service of the declared archipelago, the United States.
A strange thing in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-governmental armies and "contra-revolutionary".
The Cuba, led by a Unity Party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused of European or American NGOs of the suppression of rights and freedoms, especially of freedom of opinion.
Insane kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
On Friday afternoon, a gunned wraithman killed a eighty-year-old person for the main business time in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Huuts-de-Seine) at the end of the late afternoon.
The 28-year-old attacker had injured the 80-year-old for unexplained reasons in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knifes and this, according to police statements, under the presence of Witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, was reported to be the consequences of his injuries, according to an officer of the Alliance Police Syndication.
In or before the same pharmaceutical, he knocked up a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the thirty-six, has intervened and has been injured.
The first two victims were severely injured to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, since, according to police sources, he was apparently affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become bad as a result of the events and she is supposed to have been hospitalized as a police source in the "sock state".
The armed man, who appeared to be under alcoholic or drug influence, was to be disappeared from the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two more passengers, apparently randomly: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, with the last of both difficult.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat measuring knives that he had crossed behind his back, explained on site Arnaud Pressé, a responsible of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passengers, including youths, are supposed to have tried to bandage the insane, according to the witness reports of the AFC.
I've seen a guy in the thirty-six with a green west.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They did not succeed because the guy was well built, Alberto, a server of a nearby bar.
A hord fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his hands.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city policemen, including their managers, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knifes, so police information.
The event has occurred in one of Clichy-la-Garenne's main hits, where there are a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is a injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them in first-help statement and noticed a cracking wound in the abdomen, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, some thirty-year-old person came injured by cuts.
The officials of the State Police have finally arrested the man who had no identification documents with him.
The state prosecutor of Nanterre has instructed the district reference of Hauts-de Hanse Police (SDPJ 92) to defend the case.
The insane was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been judged.
A police source does not exclude him being delivered into a nervous healthcare.
With another police source, six policemen asked to bond him at the police commissioner in Clichy, where he was led.
He was "in a state of agitation" like "all the spiritually confused ones of this kind, in which the forces are released during the tatherpass".
U.S.: Polanskis lawyer calls for refusal of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly requested that the prosecution of his clients, who are at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral destiny of more than 30 years ago, be sentenced on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, Western United States.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", claimed to three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California serious trial error at the time of the negotiation in 1977.
I insisted on criminal arrest, M. Hummel explained before he added that the conduct of the judge Laurence Riddenband, which was appointed at the time of the trial, "is going down the back of a cold."
In fact, the Judge - who died - had discussed the Ridge Band before he fell his prosecution with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represents a grave error of proceedings.
This discussion was put up in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared the authors of the documentary film "logoned".
If the Court refuses to terminate the penalty procedure, Mr Hummel demands the lead of a process which would allow him to present the evidence of his argumentation.
On the other hand, the accusation repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the acts in charge of the accused person cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the United States in 1978, even before the proclamation of the punishment for "unlawful sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has no longer traveled to the United States.
The vice-advocate of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the negotiation".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to others accused, that escape is a way out?, asks Mrs Asayma.
They believe that "the filmmaker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now has 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that there are other alternatives to escape.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the attitude of criminal prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Also, the lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, demanded that the criminal proceedings be repealed.
She reminded her client that it would no longer be tolerated to be disturbed by any resurrection of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Twenty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the basis of an American arrest order.
After spending two months behind grids, he was then sentenced in expectation of any delivery to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is broken by the increase of the dollar and ends without course.
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a course, in a market that was between better indicators than planned in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final numbers available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq 0.55 points were given to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Fairly, the market is quite quiet," Mace observed glimpse silver by Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that it will remain so until the end of the year."
The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, "which have contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the economy's recovery", the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the United States, sales in retail trade increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and much more than expected.
Furthermore, American consumers’ confidence has improved significantly in December, to 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been broken by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level of the euro for two months, thus pushing down ''the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost something on the ground.
The obligation market has declined.
The yield of tax bonds over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the bond over 30 years to 4.497% versus 4.492% on the morning.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates, titled Miss World, will cross the last barrier on Saturday to realize their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion television.
While this great beauty fair, which is organized for the second time in a sequence in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been run to Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a truly struggle of pleasure.
Beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!, said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be transferred live from Midrand on Saturday, from 17 a.m. (15 C.E.) north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine any more beautiful land to give my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-discovering of "atemberous landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and safari, the miss is now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and was both Bollywood Stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organisers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defileer in traditional cargoes and not to forget, in the bathing suit.
The idea is presented by a TV modernist, Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-beauty king of South Africa, Michelle McLean and a responsible of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is wise to receive the world with a hardly to offer and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, visiting the famous Township in Soweto, but this time cost by bicycle and local kitchen.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was extraordinary.
Unusual for a Head of State, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains without doubt the emission in Cape Town (Southwest) to the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise for this event.
I'm wrong with people I could probably never get closer to.
I will surely return to the World Championship 2010, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday, according to his son David, is "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it's all running very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he went out of the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 a.m. local time (21 a.m.) after 13 a.m.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxing impression, assured that he would go "fastly" to the Cedars Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation on a band disc incident in Paris on 26 November.
The singer was placed "this night in Los Angeles in an artificial coma to relieve his intense pain and to carry out his treatment, announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in a artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered in Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection after a band disc operation on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo a surgery in the night from Wednesday on Thursday because of the last action caused by sickness changes.
On Friday morning, his wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French gymnastry in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP found.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatic surgery department at the Hopitel Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The manufacturer has severely stressed the neuro surgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
They explained to us that he had done the most pure massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely disturbed, explained Mr Camus.
I've heard of the possibility of initiating a trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally called this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip totally unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I already had two tape operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he told at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom after a brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with a doubtful reputation, who has been sentenced several times because of failures and not forgetting for tax detention and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical chamber, called him "a man without screw", who has to be "regular" before the chamber board and "all other things are advisable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux delivered an explanation on Friday on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This explained that the intervention would have been "perfectly expired" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "collected no bleeding and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer whose health problems have arisen since the last summer seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is too narrow for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The Party Alliance UDF (Union for French democracy) is energetic and calls on the Party of Nouveau Centre to stop using its seals
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, reacted strongly on Friday on an attempt to take the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the Chairman of the Party of Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him to no longer use this seal on document under threat of a judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had given the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose party is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To highlight his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ehemal UMP, now at NC), who claimed the property of the UDF brand, as he first requested this brand at the "Institut national de la proprieté industrial" in 2004.
However, the business office of the UDF party alliance monitored by François Bayrous's Friends broke the silence and made it clear that they were not encountered and set a deadline for the Minister and the Member under threat of a judicial prosecution to stop using this seal and to transfer the property rights of the brand to it.
During the last few days, you have made numerous statements that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Partie MoDem and Senator Jean Arthus of the Central League.
You also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the Slogans + of today's UDF + on their political material and on your website.
As you know, you do not have the right to use this seal, explained the UDF's business office and urged the party NC to "without delay remove the name UDF from all materials and (her) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette "required to transfer the property rights of the brand to its legal rightholders".
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories were warned.
In their letter they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and recalls that Morin and his friends have "taken the choice" to leave this 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as had been done in other 2002 to establish the "UMP" party.
The Partie Nouveau centre has therefore, according to the Signatorial, no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last convention of the UDF in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the business office continues, "when he applied for the brand name, he has been no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the absence of the absence of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
In addition, you consider that this ignorance is the best way to transform itself into a crime, and ironizes the NC strategy: "It seems more worthwhile to us in politics as well as in life to make yourself a name rather than to try to get out of anonymity by entering a name, in a fraudulent way, in which you do not have any legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for the exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claimed, has exploited a weak moment of eighty-year-olds to swallow part of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weaknesses before the court, a crime which is sanctioned with a freedom penalty of not more than three years and a penalty of EUR 375 000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this affair that is worthy of the Saga one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter are bold and at the same time have the wrecks of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bedencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The Erbin and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have so far refused to conduct such an investigation, not under the conditions presented by Nanterre State Prosecutor.
The physicians appointed on Friday should present a report before 10 March 2010, in which you clearly announce whether and at what time Liliane's Bedencourt could have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the judgment of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady to be protected, he confirmed.
For two years the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal appeal against François-Marie Banier, photographer and allround artists, and accused him of exploiting the weakness of her mother for years to swallow a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
On the other hand, Liliane had always refused to be manipulated by the photographer, which she views as a long-standing friend.
Although the court had to examine the validity of the appeal initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the Plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family debt on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she disbelieved the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I had written to Banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
Françoise has never been able to speak since her marriage."
The State prosecutor of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to respond in this way, especially because in the last few days a court judge has rejected its application to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane bedencourt "is fully legally capable, is not protected and has no fork.
No one has the right to act in their place," reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to judge after the process of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Explanation?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the position of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies said to the consumer before the marketing revolution: it is the best for the staff to admit "values" as it was formerly designed on consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customers the focus of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the site ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicide of France Telecom, PSA or Renault is only the top of a much bigger phenomenon, which particularly affects the employees.
This demobilisation negatively affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R & D and, even more decisive, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "is calling for a proactive approach and a future-oriented approach" by all employees which fully contradict the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we call for an operating revolution that would consist in putting employees in the centre of the company's concerns equally rightly next to the customers.
The very preconditional benefit of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to payers, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First, because I could find that, in view of a new situation, the whole fabric eventually requires priority to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarism - one of the pathologies of power-proportional to the importance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanical from the major engineering schools.
They take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the US's "Neurowissenschaften" and unawarely widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "hebel" (sic) for the commitment of employees, a current survey by Ipsos, strengthens the leaders in a position of a mechanical control system that is unappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate in any consideration or practice of governance a basic protocol: for the payee, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears to be clearly a means to achieve some of its dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their companies on the basis of a prescribed Doxa which allows them to estimate what it offers to them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measuring of these mobilisation factors, the management forces of companies can control, predict and advance their "social performance" and place their human resource management on the right hand.
Thus they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the harmonised development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the talk held by Barack Obama in Oslo on the morning and were satisfied that the Peace Nobel Prize 2009 defended the concept of "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had ridiculed the allocation of the price to Obama on 9 October this time applauded the President's speech, following the example of the former vice-presidency candidate in the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wing of the Republican party in the US Today newspaper and added that she himself spoke the topic of a "sometimes necessary" war in her memories recently published.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it's necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; one way to explain his decision from nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, held that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I felt that the speech was really very good, the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognised the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway", felt that this speech was historical.
The previous Member, who is considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they could "not be free and not give a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama held "a very American speech".
In addition to representing himself as a "cosmopolit", as he does always, he "speaked like an American president" when he pointed out that the Europeans "live like in a security bubble that they have not created themselves and do not do much for their protection," Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, the former UN Messenger John Bolton, a Falke of the Era Bush, referred to on the website of the National Review Online as "language, high-ending and inspirationless".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of armies.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the tempered left continues to be praised on the president's side.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the nobel prize was forgiven to Obama, described the talk itself as a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The talk in Oslo " offers a final plan for the management of international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says the California newspaper.
The New York Times believes that Obama announced "the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "donk and exemplary at the same time".
Fernfahrer: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike command and the threatening heavy supply pass to Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the State Secretary of Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second night of negotiation, traders distinguished early Friday morning in the hope of rapidly signing the agreement on late morning.
And that, although the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the Agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be afraid that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
Thus, the hour rate for workers with the lowest wages increases from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not much, but we're starting a little one time," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now advised to stop the supply centres.
"There will, however, always be a few contradictions that are not satisfied with the agreement," he supplements.
The TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "tough difficult to grant these wage increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human mind and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke about "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs by 3 %, as well as the maintenance of the total road transport facility in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable it to address the 13th monthly content and modernisation of tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of levies for employers at EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft law of corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday on the night of Thursday.
The government calls for a " identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the undertakings connected to this organisation and then, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour, for the entire profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", assures Bussereau.
The opposition of employer associations may only delay the procedure.
The UNTR Association was proclaiming a "deceptive trade" because the EUR 100 million "was already promised to compensate for a part of carbon tax".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to distort the Gans Esser on the nearby Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, "the agreement threatens to kill the small and medium-sized businesses of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest railway network in France for the large room of Paris and the Île-de-France continued in the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport management), which will continue to wait for the stakeholders with their demands for wage subsidies.
On this important shopping week before Christmas, no trains took place between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central route was only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travelers to climb.
The purchase chain of Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the large businesses technically".
The RER A line is through the Paris ballast space from west to east.
The RATP route section connects the Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre locations as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and nearly no one during the time of traffic poor.
As already on Thursday, there was no human wave on the railroads, since the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had resolved the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less exceeded than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnastics.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina explained, engineer (29), he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work in time".
The SNCF, who had invested in the care of travellers by staff and order forces, pointed out that there was no entrance in the Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or towards Cergy-Le-Huth arrived or travelled over the Saint-Lazare railway station to ensure the connection to the Metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the stakeholders took place again, while the results were reviewed which the associations had considered "necessary" after the meeting with the top of the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER business leader proposed a specific drafting of a RER A protocol on all relevant aspects, working hours, career courses, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-term wage payment.
The CGT was disturbed that the RATP itself puts its wage proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership tip "is not able to solve a problem, while this was possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a re-meeting for the "developing of the working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, some 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership tip that to date rejected any discussion during the strike and pointed out a meeting after a reassurance of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the line RER B after a predeclaration of Unsa and Independents.
The associations require a wage allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and also complain about the worsening of the working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, include a gross wage of 2.200 to 2.700 euros and a wage allowance of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as sun and holidays.
The Turkish Constitutional Court dissolved the Pro-Curdisk Party.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the disruption of the pro-Curdian main party of the country; a decision following immediately wrathful demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government's work extremely difficult to reach the hands of the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts during 25 years.
The "party for a democratic society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "place for activities that are disadvantaged for the independence of the State and its indispensable unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision had been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to raise the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including the Chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity, enjoying Turkey and Tuglu, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (from 550).
Participants expressed themselves before the judgment that parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament rather than meet pardelic parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Bundesgericht Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya and accused the DTP to follow the "Weisungen" of Kurdistan (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures "no connection" to PKK, refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court is working between the government, which is trying to meet the Kurdish Community and propose a number of measures to strengthen Kurdish rights to decorate the support of PKK by the Kurds and to end conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-explosion of tensions in south-east anatolia, where numerous demonstrations had led to conflicts with the police in recent weeks against the conditions of arrest of the PKK Chef Abdullah Öcalan.
Since the notice of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the DTP's rooms in the millions of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mainly populated by Kurden.
The order forces used tear gas granates and water shields when the demonstrators began to throw molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Turkk assumed that the judgment of the Court "will further deepen despair".
"Turkey cannot explain this (Kurdian, n.e.c. redaction) question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party emerging from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the conclusion of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Minister for Energy, Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpeding of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"Man can obviously react to the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed to be an attack that three days earlier killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow breaking can come
A really knocky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to shake the citizens, says the Winter Service Manager of the FES.
Specially, so that his employees can try and control the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be so ready for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES will take an exact plan.
As soon as it is surface-decked snow and temperatures are lower than zero degrees, 20 so-called A-ways are driven with large-stroke vehicles, Brauburger explains.
This includes some main roads, such as the New Road and Hanauer Road.
But also fire tours, OpenPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with pleasures, such as the Atzelberg Street.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres had to be distributed in a maximum of three hours with moisture salt, which was better liable.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock in the night, "with which the routes are free until vocational traffic starts."
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because no one is willing to place the spear vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it does not continue to snow, the roads are in line with supplies and exclution, including the Council-Beil streets.
The last priority is side and sideways.
There will be complaints, knows Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the footmen of the FES will take priority on the road, risk points and transitions.
The FES is mostly unable to take care of all cycling paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in mind especially from 22 to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is on this fast glaze, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Way of Dinosaurs
Tawa Hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long head with sharp, bowled teeth, short arms with seal crabs and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine Science of Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangäa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about family relationships, the spread and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to dig on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur knees on one day, which is unprecedented for disposal from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new type.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of five individuals.
Found confirms theories about dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurian fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly one can only find individual fractions."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
The dinosaurs appeared for the first time some 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, why the allocation of these ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, experts are debating when the equations were divided into their three main development lines: the meat-eating theropods, including later the Tyranosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds known as "long-hearts" four-bone saurropods and their relatives, and the plants eating ornithischia (bird basin saurage), including the types of triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theropod.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, at the head of Tawa Hallae, researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also own the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air sacks, breathing the birds is more efficient than the mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spinal columns were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant saurods also had air bags and lightweight construction legs later, the common ancestor of both groups probably had produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs ever lived in South America, researchers follow that the ebbs appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were distinguished early and spread from South America across all the continents, which were still a single land mass as the supercontinent of Pangäa at the time.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two more, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot come from a common, immigrated ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-designer of the Science Study.
Obviously there are also contradictions.
An even older type, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today Poland, says Bonner Palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image, because in South America, very many primitive dino fossils have been maintained, while there is little to find in other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant landwirls of the medieval age, it is still puzzled.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their lives with many other reptiles, for example with the crocodiles of today and the air sauriers and with numerous other echoes.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while relatives died out at the border from the Trias to the law.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles do not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could hit the competition from the field.
Anyway, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite stroke of a group of animals helped to flower, which had also developed in the Trias and has tempted a shadow deed since: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Dozens from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police rooming of the occupied casino of Frankfurter Goethe University is striking global waves.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarize themselves with the protesting students at the campus Westend.
In a German and English explanation "absurd" they "approve" the police action caused by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had allowed the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the school strike to be cleaned last week because walls and artworks had been defiled.
Five students were injured.
The injury, the judgment of the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers through a police command".
The embroidery represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism serves "delegitisation and criminalisation of the protest" and disregards the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
Dozens demand the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the harm of matters, it says.
Protest legitimated
The youth of the trade unions Verdi and the German trade unions are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landejugendssecretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of university president and police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden's country day.
We have understanding of the protest, but no understanding of Vandalism, according to the CDU country-day delegate Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, this saw the opposition fractions SPD, green and left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the front to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of discussing the arguments and demands of the students, it has been cleared.
The left has made a request that calls on the Inner Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
Long years she was considered a secret city, unavailable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow Centre, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacts with the Frankfurt Science Location Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Bürgermeister Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Department Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific funding focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ's companies will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to make contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronica.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plane town" for arms research.
Selenograd (orally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hill landscape where the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
That's right. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will fall down the city of the Baden-Werttembergian capital for a decade in a healthless building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with slides that ended in the middle of the city were then considered as transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brakes of a modern rail transport, since it once took a huge time to span out Lokomotives from the back.
Get in, keep a short time, keep driving, let's go.
And therefore the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a railway station, which is located about half a distance of the trans-European railway magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that is why the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually considered, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unpaid to implement the depth in the Hessian and the Bavarian capital.
However, headway stations have no longer a problem with entry and exit since there are modern turn trains with vehicles and tax cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 nest of the ICE rebuilding route to Ulm is now underway.
National and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The railway is also involved because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Groups.
The project is still somewhat justified by urban construction.
It creates new urban space that - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planes - is equipped with a lot of green.
For the railway system, S21 is harmful.
The railway station and the railways are intended for passenger traffic, which is typically the 80s, to be attributed to huge growth.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be to strengthen freight transport, as transport on the rail is significantly more environmentally friendly than by car on the road.
However, the new construction route is not for goods trains due to heavy climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly tangates many other railway projects.
About six billion euros are intended to be banned in Swedish.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that ten to 15 billion are realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing at other node points and narrowings in the network.
A total of 60 larger projects are listed in the Transport Ministry.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 kilometer long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built at the stairway in the time lupentpo.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake ball.
The Rheintal route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews the judgment of the airport
The State Government has left open in the Wiesbaden country day, whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has instructed experts to examine the VGH jurisdiction of more than 400 pages, said Economic Minister Dieter Posh (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written this day that, in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Lante Railway in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to reorganize the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the national government provides, should not be agreed with the legal protection of the population against nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it is going against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the representatives of the government to reject a revision at the Bundesverwaltungsgericht in Leipzig.
The SPD Group Manager Torsten Schäfer-Gumble called on CDU and FDP to return to their promises before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as "word break".
It's fucking difficult if you can keep your word, said Green-Chef Tarek Al-Wazir in announcement to the FDP choice log "We keep word".
Minister Posh rejected the contemplation of Schäfer-Gumble, who attempts the government to get to their night flights with "right distortion and tricksing".
A precise legal examination needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure discharge, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-shaking US-Großbanks strike their state feathers.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the Tarp Banking Fund to a total of $45 billion (EUR 30 billion) to a hit.
The Citigroup also plans, according to a report by the US Sender CNBC, to refund State aid.
The institutes are thus seeking to resolve the limitations associated with the adoption of the money – such as the limitation of the payment of managerboni and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had acquired $19 billion fresh money from investors over wall loans.
The rest of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well filled by savings.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money spray has helped over a very difficult time.
The monetary house had resolved to the climax of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
The Citigroup also wishes to obtain money on the capital market for the exemption from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a approximately $20 billion heavy increase in its capital, reports CNBC, calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker did not want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Selection
Everything went faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Administrative Board had pushed off the office the official manager Nikolaus Brender, the transmitter can present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the board wanted to vote on staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was the favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the transmitter - officially in order not to intervene in the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role in avoiding further damage to the ZDF adventurer Markus Schachter, and this proposal should also not be passed to the Governing Council.
Frey, Schacher's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The results of the vote have not yet been found at the end of the editorial issue.
Two weeks ago, the Board of Directors failed with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voting against him. Brender's selection was a devastating defeat for treacher, but an expected one.
For the majority of the Union in the Governing Board had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in the office.
The resistance had been organised against the chief actors of the Hessen Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF's messages were lost under Brender, he rejected a further term of office of the Chefredakteur.
Soon before the election, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was poured.
Lastly, even 35 national lawyers had intervened in the debate, which considered Kochs' action as constitutional.
It doesn't have anything to do with it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, education and romance.
Afterwards, he worked at the Southwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey changed to the ZDF, first to the "now-day journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990, personal referendar of the manager; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderner of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF external policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the selection of Brenders, which was still elected on Wednesday by the Branchenblatt Medium Magazine as a journalist of the year.
Kochs Gegenderpart in the Management Board, Rheinland-Pfalz Minister President Kurt Beck, explained last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in a way that the intendant's proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a participatory politicians removal from the ZDF supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a wise chess train - by criticizing the body directly after the Brender election.
Thanks to the reporter's independence, he was able to nominate both shafts without loss of face for the editor's posts and the Board of Directors, without suspiciously choosing a party member to the office.
In any event, Frey is counted to the left-liberal in the party arithmetics.
Study is discouraged
Partial success for the students: After a year of the strike of education, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally advocated on Thursday: at a meeting of the Cultural Minister and Higher Education Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions with Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to manage their study in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test burden: in principle, each study module should conclude only with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and ensured "a realistic and reliable scale".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of audits between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries were committed to making common structures for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
There should be no other than different countries' arrangements.
Reduction of tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Cultus Ministers and Uni-Rectors have the plowed word of better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to partially reduce the number of tests drastically: "Every module usually ends with only one test," says in a 30-page paper, which will partly re-regulate the approval of study courses.
The "definite reduction in the test load", explained the President-in-Office of the Accreditation Council, Reinhold Grimm, was intended to impede a "failure development which significantly affected studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will be the "decisive criteria" for design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strictly checking" whether "unnecessary integration of students in the choice of
Events" would be avoided.
The students would have "required to receive playrooms that enable and promote own initiative".
The rules for the authorisation of new, but also for the review of existing courses shall apply.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 until all the courses have been reviewed.
For this purpose, ten accreditation agencies are empowered by the accreditation Council established by the countries.
The Ministers of Culture had in October called on the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies, that the substance fills are not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In certain states, universities and scholarships have already agreed with the Ministries of State on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rheinland-Pfalz granted additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are aimed at setting up training programmes and strengthening study advice as well as auditing and foreign agencies.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros for this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novelle of the university law into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
It is intended to improve the flexibility of the study, to ensure the recognition of performance evidence to other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the year, all the courses of the country's studies will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, government and opposition had again fought about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to commendation, the decisions were also criticized.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso High School Groups asked that the design of educational policy should no longer take place "reluctantly closed doors" of the ministers and universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students should now also speak as the affected "a word".
The future academics received support from the president of the HRK, Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Cultus Ministers with whom the HRK consulted a common reform paper.
The trade unions Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to make the Bonner decisions: it requires a legal claim that enables each graduate with a Bachelor graduation access to a further master study.
Secondly, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient master studies places with the best possible study conditions available for the current generation of Bachelor students tomorrow, says GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to set up significantly more dozens.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express themselves to freeer access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta Müller
Entering in Germany and out is pretty nearly no control..." is the start line of a poem of lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language fats the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a child book publisher before transferring to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prices, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessische Literaturforum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He provided a significant extraliterary appearance last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and decline of their securitisation acts".
Invisiblely insurd and discouraged Söllner left an explanation in which he admitted to Romanian German writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his collaboration as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitites.
Together with some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have started slimly, first 1971.
I'm, concluded Söllner, "so someone who hasn't denied enough against the securitisation attempts of the securities."
The lyriker Werner Söllner is im Walter.
Almost at the same time with the nobel prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literature scene, and in particular the Community of the German authors originating from Romania, is shocked by a case which identifies the descendation and defeat of a political system based on monitoring and concertation.
Werner Söllner is, as far as you can say after the previous knowledge, not only the victims, but also the victims.
In his securitisation act, IM Walter played a role, said after the confession of Söllner of the literature scientist Michael Markel and pointed to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "had cut him out for him in all of those difficulous points" said Markel.
It would be a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitite-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The affected ones, you may suspect, are speculated and in some cases I guess they knew what clear name behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and Walter were hiding.
In contrast to the very procedural viewing of Stasi acts in this country, the handling of the securitisation surveillance is still very diffus.
A systematic information has been reversed and disabled in recent years.
One of the Birthler consultants of the National Council for the Development of Securitisation Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the release of the documents has been more sleek since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law regulating the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former securitite members in Romania is still very large, after the nobel price was announced for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitite CEO from Temesvar abandoned the prizeholder.
She's got a psychosis, eventually, they've only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Surely the case of Söllner, as often as in connection with concealed debt, is inevitable.
Why now? Who was damaged? The sensible reaction of listeners to Söllner's confession makes it hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by knowledge rather than by debt and shame.
To cure the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Attachment Champions League
It seemed that there was just a adrett dressed outside serviceman from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports article manufacturer had distributed Goodies when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored plastic bag of the equipment, rose a quarter after midnight in a c-class called.
The man with the marvelous glaze was driven because of the stranger city.
Otherwise he could have driven himself - alcohol was finally not in the game, and lucky was the 55-year-old as little as possible.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is going on.
Or go right.
In the words of the first three days previously committed Swiss: "We have reached the eighthfinal," thanks to the 3:1-following Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded from the success: there will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" is ahead of Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the king class performance in the League everyday life in Mainz.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates through Marica (5th), Trash (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Exemption
The eighthfinale of the Champions League (Insights 16/17. + 23/24 February/ Replays 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be released on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy of the fulminant condition of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only to the suspected healer who had provided the insurer Stuttgart Profis in the short time self-confidence, use-freeness and joy.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and have stopped them to be courageouser, Seelenklemper Gross explained the so simple sounding success recipe, which had no effect anymore under therapy babble.
He developed a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, things sometimes happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weekly injury break thanks to his dynamics, developed as the best player on the place, tried to describe the discovered "phenomenon" with the speaking "fresh wind" and the way the new manager works: "He is a man who takes through and requires discipline.
That is what we need in the present situation."
It was evidently missing under Babbel.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns Sports Board Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs constance in particular.
Like Gross, players and managers also avoided overestimating the victory against a weak and totally excessive defence of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, four days later in liver kisses at 0:4 the evil awakening, Khedira gave in mind.
And athlete director Horst Held admonished that even though a seasonal goal was achieved, the other was still in a further distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
At his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory for three months, Hero was not celebrated in the event of the weekend, which lived freshly in the form of a television interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann, direct before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, the hero contended the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the Board of Directors weakness and decided to change the pressure of pubertating fans.
Also that his free day was deleted after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgrace.
Lehmann's statements were "made by pure selfishness", hero resigned and announced consequences for the final man.
I don't think you're gonna be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with all others that without pre-working by the dissolved trainer team, the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a great share of success," said hero and Lehmann unisono - as well as the man agreed with the plastic bag.
WM-Fight in heavy weight
Heat Duell in Bern: Always provoked Challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his weight title according to the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains box world champion in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old Champion, after the version of the WBC Association, defeated the US American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian was already two times world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional combats, he had to be hit twice because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Around 17.000 audiences in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left leader hand.
But the 11 cm smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko age before the Duell, repeatedly disappeared the battles of the world champion, so Klitschko could not make his dangerous rights decisive.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his struggles hit the world champion rarely.
He was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had arranged some spines before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "wessful zombie" which "cann't be right."
When wearing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson the sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory at Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he had then beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and got back "his" WBC belt, which he had to leave without war.
This year he then caught Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one stroke in this struggle and is physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
But the WBA belt is carried by the British David Haye after it was able to unthrone the 2,13 meters of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously announced a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Its promotion company is now already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greenen Group Chief Jürgen Trittin called the Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the customer's affair.
SPD and left demand information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings about the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition of Defence Minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has undermined a conscious deception.
The minister said to the deadly bombing on two tank load trains of September "insight of the falseness," said Greenen-Fraction Head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It is called landing: he lied.
The command to kill was issued with regard to the rules of the International Warranty Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report which NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it had become known that the attack was not only a destruction of the cargo kidnapped but also a goal of killing two Taliban leaders.
The US Air Attack requested by the German Commander Colonel Klein had been killed or injured, according to the Nato Survey Report, up to 142 people.
Greens, SPD and Left asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Office of Kanzler, Federal Defense and News Service has approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greenen-Kollegin Renate Künast demanded.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism decisively.
The Office did not influence concrete operations of the federal war in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday also doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had become loud.
According to the information of SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tank loader attack.
Officially, they had promised that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and kept the Minister of Sensitive Details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they stated that they had even referred to the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-sided document by Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wizert is now supposed to have asked in a letter for clarification of the fact, reports the Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper.
He has not received a reply so far, says it.
The Ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this was clarified in the Federal Inquiry Committee, which wishes to conciliate on the next Wednesday.
Worlds of dreams
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychological illness and in drug noise, the limits between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything's fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can devote ourselves to the most wild ideas and imaginations.
However, the one who experiences dreaming conditions, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear in the modern Western world is usually considered crazy or drug addictive, at least as a special person.
However, such images and voices come not only in psychiatric illnesses or in drug noise.
Debt has our imagination power: The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write romances sometimes make the limits between dream, wrath and reality fade.
Dream-like changes in wake awareness conditions may occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case Wahn.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystician Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic depression conditions, psychos and hallucinations, can be found on similar processes.
Hallucinations or bizarre ideas occur when the balance of the neuronal bone materials of the brain - all predominantly dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complicated hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no longer power over him.
The context of wrath and dream has philosophers and medicines occupied since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, in 1861, found a "great similarity of irration with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inaccurateness, inspiration, senses of such a."
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity has no longer power over him, he swoops on the room roof.
He feels a step.
Behind him, wing demon shapes with blood-red, distorted fractures, teeth-flying.
They hunt him, step him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Sounds, evil voices shrink from walls and radio.
He can't endure them anymore, the voices that blaspheme him and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo, knobs them into a snare and sticks them to a ceiling on the ceiling.
He rises to a speaker and lays the snare around his neck.
Jump.
The snare's gonna be ridiculous.
This shall be a teaching for you, and the voices shall cry in a drunken choir, "Go into the clinic and let yourself heal."
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychos, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
She was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic paranoide psychosis, and he is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, manie, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The Trug images are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in life from schizophrenia, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected person can usually no longer distinguish between the interior and the outside world, they get into a superior state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The person concerned can no longer separate important from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out interfering signals, the consciousness is overflowed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The reality experience in the psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the Hospital for General Psychology at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The Schizophrene is located in the centre of the event, everything has an important focus on it.
At the same time he becomes a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively form them.
Shizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality synchronization is usually not possible for them, the fraud images are horrible reality, waking out.
Once in life a hallucination experienced
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the senseful and spatial structure of the reality that is observed in the psychosis remains in principle."
The incredible thoughts and hallucinations are found in the reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain hits capriols, researchers still present puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can lead to short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic composition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the solely determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimum brain damage to the affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains fuchs.
But there remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neuronal system can be achieved, which at first does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is available.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychos as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain goes hot
The crazy is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get some, says Lübecker Psychology Professor Erich Box.
Whether fraud images are felt as pleasant or unpleasant, often is only a question of the position.
Box has been collecting reports on hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are one of the typical accompanying symptoms of psychos, but also of amazing many other diseases.
These include, in addition to psychic disorders such as borderline or depression, diseases such as migräne, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or alzheimer and skull brain tumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory content, which are usually kept back.
They emerge when the hernales, in which mental perceptions are processed, are overactive or too little inhibited; if our brain is running hot or even if there is no stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But it's also risen, stressed, loved, or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies up to one third of the respondents indicated that at least once in life a hallucination has been experienced.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnastics.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break it may occur that a slaughtery boy with long, dark hairs speaks to it.
If it answers to him, the schoolmates look at it surprisedly - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
You think this shy girl is a sponsored daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? She sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other fraud images are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most scary
The fraud images are often also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher in her eyes and ears presents just a new schoolmate, while he explains mathematical equations for all others and visible on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary.
When she waits in her dark room for the sleep that comes too rarely and much too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming whether the pictures she sees occur the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts of arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, scream her at the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell them that they would think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today 20 years old.
She had the abiture last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from a ride, he has with great probability after a while of hallucinations, says box.
I suspect that the brain is then unemployed and self cares for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had fear of other children as a little girl, often played her alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called Papa since she can think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult to distinguish the affected ones like Sarah K. to distinguish fraud images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "the reality is happening in the brain.
Hallucinations are also pictures that cause the brain to develop, so they act so real."
Night dream images also call box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of health are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenes, psychological health can be recognized as irregular.
Therefore, box advises his patients to value hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too consciously centered world, imaginary experience is most pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, sad disease, but it also stores positive, creative - wrath is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneiroide form of experience, a special form of dream-likely modified watch awareness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake condition afterwards.
Oneiroide consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motoric paralysis at full consciousness.
If a person is threatened of self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability of movement, he replaces the life threatening real situation with a own, imaginary world which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since the handling of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change takes place, but the real situation is contradicted in imagination.
An intense form of sense and sense in an inconsistent situation, which enables people to be self-designed not to fall into nothing of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his uneiroid experiences in his book "Creation of the Heart" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness is travelling for days after a heart beating surgery with subsequent heart transplantation, while his body at the intense station is condemned to motionlessness.
Claussen diving into a self-created world, visiting foreign times and places: He experiences himself as an obscure, old man, on board a train anatorium, a robot watchs his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among Adligen who produce drugs from blood.
If a Greek is dragged on the motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his spiral bed in the corn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He's completely upset in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner travels differ fundamentally from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In contrast to that, the memories of mental travel are impressive for me after years and in extraordinary details.
More clear and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroides, psychos, hallucinations and drug noise show how broken our inner images of external reality are in guards.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes the box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
Experience that can also be enriching.
The snow breaking can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an intermediate solution: Langfristig Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he said to SPIEGEL.
Holding will also be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit 27 years of age and have the firm will to enter the company, said the 69-year-old to SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged for the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is only afterwards.
Also the question whether they are able to do so.
You cannot introduce 7500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the Chairmanship from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
He was first responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for corporate ability and after Jürgen Todenhöfer's exclusion, also came to the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to bridge over "10, 15 years," said Burda.
The Holding should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
In view of the cases of lottery and Shaeffler, Burda said that family companies are not sure before destruction: "This always concerns families who were infected by a totally speculation of capital and thought they could rise to a very large player.
My strategy was never that.
He had no world-power dreams, so Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was jumper, and I don't want to play with 'time' in the world league, these shops have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you wish about beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which has recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2im shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among other renowned companies such as Hedonai, who ensure a dehair with laser; spaxión, rooms to relax and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that produces through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
A relaxing massage with your partner to enjoy and at the same time have a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxing area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total surface is 250 m2, which is divided to 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments and for hydro therapy.
For example, for caveitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The fitness studio also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of customers' training units and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
You start a training unit with the input of a personal password on a touchscreen located over the devices.
Then you will see various videos how to perform your training units properly.
The head of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating and detonating exercises) are perfectly enough to train the body muscles.
And if you then, after you have trained your body, still want to look past the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered to recover hair beauty, glossy and health for your hair in a personalized manner.
Innovation and exclusiveness seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 a.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletes
Christmas moves closer and so it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and get their fixed clothes into our garments.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an excessive and very complicated decolleté. It's only possible to advise.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
Endsa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidising, etc..
On the other hand, the MOVELE project will be developed to promote the electric car and opinions and actions of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to promote the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities elected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The Endsa electricity company has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (La Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative to take part in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates throughout Europe in standardisation groups and has a wide range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a Horizon of Rest" for the automobile sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesys the Spanish automobile industry, who is the largest exporter of the country, "a Horizon of Rest".
In presenting the financial report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero reminded again of the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the reign year.
"Without the plan on the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today have a panorama of negligence and closure of some of our main production works," explained the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automobile manufacturers to produce in a very competitive industry in Spain in future, we can see a quiet horizon for the accession of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the plan for competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models, as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which is applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and automobile manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to decrease by 6% on average , which, in turn, resulted in a "powerous increase" in the authorisations that increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first issue of the International Classic Automobile Messe is organised, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of engines.

Skill tests are also carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a specially configured racing route in the autumn area of the fair area.
Mazda3 i-stop: environmentally compatible sports
Mazda wants to prove that athlete is fully compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and access system of the engine, baptized on the i-stop name, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazda 3 is producing by its good notes at the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanic, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seat, you can find that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomy and good hold.
The game of the wheel is also excellent.
When viewing the unit consisting of the instrumental table and the armature board, you can find that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the magnificent colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend to a futuristic interior design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both Mazda 3 and the Civilian, both Japanese models, are deprived of the nutrition of German cars, especially of the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to be more than possible.
The driving stream of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can be comfortable with the car.
All of this comes to a large and clearly shaped bagroom.
The stop and access system is currently only available for the 2-liter gasoline engine with 150 PS and a 6-pass switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It emerges through its fineness, by its silent noise, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its great comfort in the circulation and its low consumption, even if Mazda is particularly the diesel models most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called model Sportive is selected for the testing, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the series excitement, the assistant for the change of tracks (RVM) is producing the dead angle, but also the controls for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inside mirror, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the chrome 17-inch flags.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it was not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, mainly the learnable Bixenon beams and the sound system BOSE with CD charger.
Fazit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behavior and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not spend many miles a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is available only with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is a little high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the luxury model and 23.270 euros for the sampled model Sportive.
However, as a compensation to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest passport.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red tape of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can read only his emails without an opportunity to see certain attachments or surf via the Internet.
It enjoyed its celebration in five minutes when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still mainly for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of this, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same borders as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to have to miss all the data to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or if you desperately are looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should actually have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for abroad stays, but, after my experience, you already need a doctor's title in physics and a good glasses to read all the small printed ones.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission on affordable roaming tariffs for Europe as a whole has almost always been noted.
Out of its own country, you're always afraid of reading your emails and rightly.
That a small device like FonPeek (which is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it has no wifi/wLAN) can offer this kind of tariffs, means that the telephone providers need to think slowly, but safely, and start considering different possibilities how they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices is downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without vegetation and without hooks.
It is an Internet-approved device and one pays for it only once, when buying, and not month after month.
And that's exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek to buy with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at Barack Obama's office as president of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and have chosen the same color again to accompany him with his, no doubt, second important moment in his life: the award of the Peace Nobel Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has carried similar models at both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and thereby weared something largely embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first view it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress in more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ very differently in the type of fabric they are made of.
When she was introduced, she was wearing a dress of top and in Oslo one of patterned seeds.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and for the second time an endless model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was stuck up as a hair crane at this occasion, when she had previously carried the hair open.
75% of the working mothers have had problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in younger women who want children.
This result is the study of women's fertility and career in Spain, carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 makes no doubt: 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities in the labour market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if yes, what kind of profession they exercise.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity, work only half-day or have no fixed work contract are more mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women with a firm employment, especially in the public sector, move the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment will only receive their first child on average 3.7 years after the date of the meeting, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment, who have needed longer to achieve this and who have moved together and the first child has only achieved much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar in terms of reception,” explains the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when women are married and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they have only primary school graduation or higher education, were averaged with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, depending on their educational level, there is another difference between women.
While women with primary graduation are married before their first job and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation make it exactly different and first get a fixed job and then get their first child, Delgado detects.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also the widely known advertising "Because you are worth it".
The main actress of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will thus become another famous pendant like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones who were allowed to join this exclusive club were the actors of the Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
With the men, the cosmetics company has only exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey ("Gray's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Grey's play colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The prices of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual prize award held at the Royal Court of Justice in London.
For this occasion, they had all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) the three ray images of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fear - influencing genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an integrity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not spare any horror or relief.
Besides, this book is a delicious lecture, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his sides, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost senseful desire, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy fate, the moral without guilt and the innocentness without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, all-gorian Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between power and ignorance, with a crushing poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, whose banners, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasures of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come to heaven on the way of corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, which is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, you have to climb up at the north wall, on the wall, where you always try the best mountain climbs on the new."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny cake.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a good owner of the county and again said he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born from a certain groom."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo would halle down to the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This he made in a journey on which he fleeed from himself and with a speech full of violence before the worms pleaded to the neighborhood.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "These verses of Spencer are engraved on his grave: "the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunder of the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after a satisfied life, you find pleasantness in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her baggage she always had her depression.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII spioned them between the Azales or sang the birds in Greek.
It is not known any other case where the man was so patienced and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much bigger than her madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to put Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he didn't bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except that man's glory, so that he might put himself on this pod?"
Coward aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district last week in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years lived next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we have taken out of the animal home and who weighed just six kilos, and then from warmer sky they missed him two footsteps and hurt him hard.
Our disarmament cannot be understood in words, as it is incomprehensible for us, because the fun is supposed to be a small and helpless animal that has been carried out on the line in a cheap way of aggression.
In addition, a woman who walked cozyly received the embroidery attack when she wanted to correct those people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a crazy person attacks a dog, he may even be doing it with a woman, a child, an elderly master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a generally quiet city district at 5:00 p.m. on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has cryed all day long.
Of course, we have reimbursed announcement at a nearby police department, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring about anything and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our disarmament over the event has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the heads of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal fun, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
In collaboration with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially with younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies have announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which includes "more than just the design and manufacture of products that become more and more secure every day" and confirmed that it also contributes to a step closer to this goal every day with other actions of pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign for promoting helmet use on the motorcycle running under the "Tobe or not to be" strike will be distributed in a first phase to more than 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
At the end, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, it is always obliged to be one of its main objectives to be the development of increasingly safer products.
The sale of small cars is rising somewhat
After almost two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in reference to 2008, and, much more important, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, measured by the manufacturers' association of Anfac and Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are at present only with great caution, as the reference data used to compare November 2008, which was a particularly poor sales year with a decrease of 60% in relation to the previous year.
However, it should be remembered that, except for the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months remain 40 % below the sales rates of the previous financial year.
Since January a total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transporter market have been included: pick-ups, small transporters, small cars and lighter cars/cars.
In addition, the same clouds are still the same in the sky, which are most embarrassing on demand, since even though some of the vehicles are purchased by private persons, the majority of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises who are doing purchases with a third-funding in almost 100% of all cases.
In this way, further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the continuation of the poor economic situation, need to be included in these restrictions, which are the consequences of the reversed banking of credit institutions.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped little in purchasing a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for private persons, even self-employed and small companies have the right to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 exhaust that may not exceed 160 grams per travelled mile, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam reminded us that it is essential for the State to focus a special focus on these small loaders and, of course, on industrial vehicles (last cars and buses).
The car dealer association predicted a similar year for 2010 as the previous year, for which a sales failure (for passenger cars and land cars) is expected to be 19%.
Support for brake manoeuvre in critical situations is now required
As with the ABS anti-blocking brake system and as with the ESP stability control at the moment, the aid systems for braking in emergency must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and small carriers, for the rest of the vehicles a carence period was established by the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union aim to improve the protection of footgängers, but these brake systems can also help to prevent many accidents because of their working manner.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake manufacturing which the system recognizes using the brake strength carried out by the driver on the brake spedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an inquiry by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collaboration no longer came to step to the brake spedal and half of them had not broken with full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid takes into the brake system with maximum power and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car leaves at the brake process.
According to a EU study, up to 1.100 fatal accidents that affect footing users could be prevented every year if all cars were equipped with such an emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is expected that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time it already exerts a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase pressure on the brake spedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant is exercising the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the occupation of the Opel work in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. vehicle manufacturer points out that he needs more time to finish the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already agrees on each item of the plan.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which works exist, will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that there will be a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automobile builder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper port cars, which is covered by the Russian group Converg, is increasingly encouraging.
If none of these buyers were to have an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to conclude Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
On the steering of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it easier by 80 kilos, with which he now brings only 1,275 kilos to the scale.
To create such a thing, they first rejected the automatic expansionable roof, which was replaced by a tent leather roof with manual drive, so that one has saved 21 kilos alone; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappearing" another 15; by removing the air conditioning once more 13; and also by reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, thereby further 7 kilos were saved; by the installation of sporty baquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch fields, the five more.
Then, by the absence of the CDR-30 audio system, it had again reached six kilos less and by the exchange of door handles by handles of substance the missing kilo.
Although he is also available with the double coupling drive PDK, the testing was carried out with a vehicle with 6-way handdrives, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain routes that really were very curved.
You can only give him the note in your driving behavior.
However, the reduction in his weight has not in any way led to the fact that he would not now be so safe on the street.
It's rather the opposite of the case: we haven't been testing such a small and easy model for a long time, but at the same time we have a feeling of great security at the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of making his muscles warm at a low walk in the required time, until we give him the commands to racing, braking, restoring, and then getting back to new everything out of his engine ...
He's doing everything they tell him. The car makes everything we meant to him with our hands on the wheel, thanks to his steering which is as communicative as well as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all taste directions
The sound of his V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded, and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which has already been used for the first time at Panamera.
The acceleration ability is inevitable brutal, whether from standing out or when accelerating again.
The feathers are strong but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraßen on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and even though we found some of these curves ice in the morning grey and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it is an ultraeasy car, a car with which you have an indescribable passport, as it is probably rather rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and costs 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an opportunity starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as their bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82-91 at his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 in the review).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Mrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of use and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 rated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game started with the leadership of the Blaurotes, who sat at the top of the advertising table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already realized that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, just that the team from Álava decided to play a inner game of Barac and the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the team with peppers and applause, which is his home to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to emphasize himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" review of splitters was already expected that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Yet, despite the clear advantage in the break, the Maccabeans had not yet decided, and the Vitorians wanted to remind the Vitorians that not everyone wins on their playground, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elias" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "gulves" turning the rod (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, hurt, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few trains with meeting security to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive threefolds and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the advertising table again was displayed a relaxing distance from (54-67) which the host could reconcile with (57-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alaves were blossomed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they honestly deserved in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their teams, and tried to return their team through three points from the line (70-77).
Yet, and although dividers were put off the place for fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defend themselves well and even though the Israelis still recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from being commanded
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to join him the leadership in the group B of Euroliga, and that in a game that was characterized by the failure of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which facilitated the Greeks’ victory.
The team from Málaga was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing crew, which might be one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive threefolds, two of them through Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the hosts bleached with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the one Unicaja, although the local crew with an inner game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to indicate the advertising table in the 13th minute 22-20 to their benefit, the minute in which it had almost come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to get warm and his superiority on both play halfs, while the excretion of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in Unicaja.
Among their players in the interior field and the Lithuanian preplayer Linas Kleizas, with its threefolds, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A rehearsal was impossible
The third play quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, showed a higher degree and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which, in turn, brought the leadership within the group into swing.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the excretion of the Scottish Robert Archibald who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja in the 31st minute, thanks to the feathering and the threefolds of Cook and the use of Lewis again came a little hope to 66-57.
Yet it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, was not to be braked.
In the 37th minute, the Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to depart from the leadership of Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook because of your profile?
The Facebook users can now learn their salaries thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain, which they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users on the basis of more than 140,000 jobs available in Trovit in Spain. Users are available on Facebook in which they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after one week, after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "in average poorly paid," explains the product Trovit Responsible, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the most poorly paid according to the data available by Trovit through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross rate of 45.226 euros and a French 31.059, as opposed to the 24.000 euros a Spanish deserves.
Accordingly, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euro in Spain.
According to Trovit, the most poorly paid work in Spain is a service provider with an annual EUR 11.592 net; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and the worker with EUR 15.667.
The most visited posts on the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-day offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President withdrawn from the Office shall leave diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest when his mandate is officially completed
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27, because his mandate is going this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The transmitter also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the set date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (which proclaimed Porfirio Lobo as a winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed to reject Zelayas' refusal to recognize the status of a asylum seeking politician who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the chair of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the most tempting days since the past spring, the inflation of the assets was the dominant atmosphere on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which in no way is surprising, since this is their natural condition, in a environment where the makers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly leave liquidity free for interests moving around the zero in order to allow banks to buy assets for bills.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to spread some sand into the drives, as the BCE has already done with its annual increase, will take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we will be witnesses of a reverse in reducing risk premiums.
The fleet of stock exchanges and the differences in business bonuses are rising again, even though they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to state private risks and government debts rise again.
It is now re-established on quality and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area in relation to Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then came standard & poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding the assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defenders of the moral risk, who once again tried to reduce the consciousness of those responsible for the world economic policy, because they had defeated the devastating effects of the limitation of loans to the loss of jobs when they should have decided a new day for thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was already predicted.
A government that fails to blame the government, elections and a new government that moves on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It doesn't make sense that Ecofin saves Hungary from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro Member State to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the obligation to maintain the stability of government funds in the necessity of unusual measures.
Yes, as expected, we are before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excavations to too high amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonuses.
However, if European differences were to be reduced and the Spanish increased further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the favorite indicators in this area force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, who come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, do not promise all of this, despite warnings, a long lifetime.
Again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although at the moment it is called "precaution when driving".
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, took up yesterday's first meeting before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on the energy supply of Spain is being debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán gave the press some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest EUR 50 billion and another 60 billion from this date until 2030, with the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants will continue to operate.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it should be invested in an increase in energy production capacity no longer, but in distribution networks and international associations.
As from 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and carbon plants with facilities for the collection of carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the preliminary suspension naturally by other "supervisory services".
Galán, who believes that the draft regulation for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is on a line with what its company demanded, would in no case say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in combating climate change.
He believes that, despite some "a few" measures, it was called the Chairman of Iberdrola.
As it is, Galán believes that decisions on investments, even if these are long-term, should be taken now, since it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to take them into action.
Ferrovial receives the "trading" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss Swiss sport, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flu Company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement which has not yet been announced has been made at five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Kastilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation in order to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million to 2012, from which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the examination of energy efficiency in motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
Construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and a motorway operator.
The city administration wants to finish the construction at the end of 2014.
Following the decision of the administration for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project in accordance with a business plan established by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and managing.
In expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to EUR 1.7 billion in Australia (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia competing in the last phase, mainly European construction companies.
The group named Transcity is addressed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second with its seat in Italy, is one of the best specialists in depth construction.
Against the team of Acciona, the consortium Northern Direct is joined by the British company Laing O'Rourke, Australian Transfield, responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (daughter company of the German construction company High depth, which belongs to ACS), also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, specialized in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatisations, however, has a barrier to overcome, as it is only by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies mentioned high depth or carfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that must only be followed by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACS have gained access in this market only by its 30% participation in high depth, owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona is very important in this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already known as a energy supply provider and in the salivation industry because of its activity.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies in order to build and manage Adelaide's salt plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground road, which will be promoted by the city of Brisbane's Office for Infrastructure and the Northern Link (Nordbringer), has the aim of connecting the western motorway in Toowong with the circuit street in Kelvin Grove (see map) to a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure for staureducation on the Strasbourg of Brisbane.
The route plan issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of the construction work in December next year.
Although this route is already intended to open for traffic in the last few months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will last until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in each direction, an electronic wall system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (EUR 308 million).
Brisbane is already a big business for high depth.
Australia forgives high depth, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million, repeatedly considerable contracts.
The ACS sub-Company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fiber cable through Leighton's domestic subsidiary.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not started yet and the depth has received 129 million.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investments are EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has delivered its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 km length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the supplement for construction work to extend the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria).
In this way Alpine enhances its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will be over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency over a sum of approximately three million euros per year, the railway company informed.
This Treaty also provides the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore has been selected under 16 agencies which have been presented to this competition, which have been declared by Renfe, of which 4 have come to the endorsements, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom for the outbreak of competition.
France's Competition Regulatory Authority has imposed on France Télécom a punishment of more than 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas of the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed networks and mobile telephones through the signing of exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers at the edge of the regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than 560 million euros in punishment since 1994 for disabilities of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, since the authority who is watching competition is of the opinion that France Télécom had in the past committed similar damages and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet in order to increase revenues from businesses that do not come from the telephone connection.
This website of Orange is in principle active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça in from the beginning of 476,4 million.
Since 1992, the Champions League has developed as a source of revenue for the Fuβball Club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of the UEFA, not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of revenue from the large associations.
According to the UEFA, the League has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (from 12 Spanish), which have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The White Club is on the third place of Europe, who has earned most money through its participation and who next to AC Milan the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The official Catalan master and last winner of the former Cup of Europe in 1992 is the fifth place.
The list leads to Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, although they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only at the third place of the countries that were able to make money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated cash allocation procedure applied by the UEFA.
During this financial year, the organisation whose chairman Michel Platini has is expected to have a total of 1.090 million revenues from the Champions League.
Of this money, the UEFA 413,1 million provide for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs participating in the qualification predecessor (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
Moreover, those fighting a participation received 3.8 million by their bloß presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they argued.
There is also a bonus for profiting (80,000 euros) and for a distinct (40,000 per crew). The clubs that have come into the eighthfinale receive three million each; the four who have come into the quarterfinal 3.3 million.
The last four receive 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus a football club receives at least 7.1 million and not more than 31.2 million fixed income.
Barça again earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money will be awarded proportionately to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places assigned.
The master of the last year receives 40% of the assigned money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games it plays during this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group has last night made details about the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force it to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In fact, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share paid to ten years and with a interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday the Sos shares ended with EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz group gives the shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that this offer was not informed, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
At a conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructuring his management.
When trying to stay at the edge of possible purchases and the judicial crossings of his ex-Manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the leader of the internal book examination.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman who has a high post in the food company.
It is a newly created post which is directly understood by the chairman of the group.
This is all other than free from polemic because the company is involved in a judicial struggle because of the suspect of redirecting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos moves further capital over the next few months.
As regards the credit of Salazar, Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representants of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the shift of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion tender by Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer
The national Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer last 9 October for Federico Paternina.
The supervisory authority declared that it approved this tender after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the laws and, according to the amendments made last 2 December, the content of the declaring document could therefore be considered "inadequate".
CNMV has also informed that this offer aims at the purchase of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of EUR 7.65 per share, which is 8.95% of the company capital, comprising 6.142.786 euros in shares approved on the markets of Madrid and Bilbao.
Furthermore, it has been noted that 5.592.78 million shares have been established which cannot be transferred in any way until the completion of the tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws of law.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents not only deserve the KFZ workshops
Thousands of vehicles involved in an accident will be dragged into the workshops each day, where a reporter has to assess the damage caused and the cost of repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and working hours can be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the reporters use this kind of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain Audatex, part of the American Group of Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are drawn up with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for reviewing and drawing up a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work on the data available by the manufacturers is nothing but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales leader of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are collaborated, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed becomes increasing to the point that in the last five years more versions, variations and engineizations have come on the market than in the past fifteen years.
Once a new car gets on the market, business starts work.
It is a difficult task, because each one of the thousand parts of the vehicle must be catagolized and its price must be entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a highly sold model, work can be completed in one week if the procedure is rapidly ahead.
If this is a less usual car, it may take up to three or four months. Currently Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with complete information.
For example, among the exclusive models they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the road car park, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of the implementation of documentation and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centres (Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually specialists for mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros each year in the preparation of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs a driver about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
In view of the products offering Audatex, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, whereas the star of the products is AudaPlus, a standard solution to assess accidents for the advisers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs of the parts, it contains the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the sales prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it at most ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly band on the basis of the driver's number.
AudaGlass is dealing with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is a service for the professional market open on the Internet that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared to be totally damaged.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, implementing geodemographic analysis or in order to obtain information about the differences by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a particular car brand have been involved in the workshop due to pans, or how many of them have been involved in a serious accident during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that devotes itself to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimates, which is also intended for experts and delivers on the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Group Einsa, which was established in 1971 as a service provider for services and solutions for assessing damage, pans or maintenance of vehicles.

Their volume of business has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 the turnover was EUR 10.8 million.
In the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of a office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is carried out in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.

Since 2007 they have been at the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Increase of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increases, with the possibility of getting access to a huge international market.
This review and purchasing service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, garages and car dealers who have to register before their activities.
This platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and managed more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them alone in Germany.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reporters today.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day on the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle numbers have been logged off may no longer be driven on the streets, but certain non-injured parts may be used as substitute parts.
On the other hand, the vehicles with historical value may be authorised again, even if they have been logged out after difficult authorities.
Workshop cost estimates in four steps
With the Auda-Taler tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:Identification of the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince older experts who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 ground cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small cars and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the driver's number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables including such as the price for working hours, prices or discounts and then let it print the cost estimate and pass on to its customers.
AudaTaller, however, is not a tool to evaluate such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, a amount that the customer can pay without delay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that has been waiting for the automechanics for a long time, for example, because you can select a door with it and then turn the image completely to view the inside.
