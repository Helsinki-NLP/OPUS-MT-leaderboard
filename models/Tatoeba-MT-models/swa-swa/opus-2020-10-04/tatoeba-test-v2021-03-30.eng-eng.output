Nilijua kwamba Tom alikuwa mpishi bora kuliko mimi.
Tom knew that I mkopod the pesa from Mary.
Tom said that he thought it would be better if I didn't do that.
I don't think anyone thinks you're crazy.
Tom and Mary waliniambia kwamba walikuwa na bacon and mayai for breakfast.
I know that Tom knew Mary didn't want to do that.
I hope I don't say any stupid one.
I'm sorry I take so long.
Tom's kwenda be sorry you don't do that.
They let me know that they would not do that.
I'm sorry that I can't come today.
Tom and Mary were scared.
I think Tom looks tired.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
Let me trust you.
Ninajua kwamba Tom alifanya hivyo correctly.
Stop criticizing me!
Tom says he doesn't do it.
I'm looking for you.
Tom said that he knew I was not going to cry.
Tom said we can't do anything about it.
I think Tom is a curious person.
Kila mtu anajua kwamba Tom was the one who broke dirisha.
Here's my pink notebook.
Nilijua ningeweza kukutegemea!
I don't think Tom knew what he wanted.
I don't know that Tom didn't need to do that by mwenyewe.
It's not like Tom is going anywhere.
Tom aliniambia that he was hesitant to do so.
I pretended I didn't know nini to do.
I know that Tom is a bum.
I don't think Tom would permit you to do that.
I want to go and change into that shirt I kununua yesterday.
Tom said that he thought Mary was lying.
You must've stayed with you.
I don't think Tom is lonely.
This is not the first time I've done this.
If Tom can't do that, perhaps no other one can either.
Nilifikiri Tom could stop by this afternoon.
And I think that the impact of kiuchumi will be limited.
You should let Tom know that Mary is to do that.
It've been fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to do that any more.
I don't think Tom will need msaada wetu.
Tom said Mary was feeling nervous.
Tom and Mary said they were over thirty.
I think Tom expects Mary to ask that she stay.
Tom said that he's definitely not going to do that.
I'm not gay, but rafiki yangu is.

Nilifikiri hivyo ndivyo tulivyopaswa kufanya.
I'd never do that to you.
Tom lazima've been quicker at doing that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needed.
Wanajua kwamba wanaweza kufanya vizuri zaidi.
There's no njia Tom would've done what you say.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that any more.
You are tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by yeye mwenyewe?
Tom and Mary say that they have been studying French.
Tom admitted he'd killed Mary.
I'd have been there by now if gari yangu hadn't broken down.
We are ndugu.
I wrote a letter for Tom.
It's going to be hard to find one to take another Tom.
I don't think that giving Tom kisu is a good idea.
I think you were going to kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do that.
It is amazing that walipaswa kuwa na nyumba ya pili in America.
Waliniambia kwamba wameshuka moyo.
Mama cannot drive a car at all.
There's a lot that was happening right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.
I don't think anyone noticed Tom's nini.
I think you're a bossy.
Tom came back to the car yake up to check, but raccoon alikuwa running over is dead as a doornail.

I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go and us.
Nilimuuliza Tom and Mary if they knew any of the French people.
Tom must've left the umbrella yake on the bus.
They tell me that they're breaking.
No one ila Tom did that.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that happened.
I pretend you're not interested in going into you.
It's not rahisi to be understood by kila one.
I am hungry.
Tom alisema kwamba alidhani ni yeye tu aliyehitaji kufanya hivyo.
I think kwamba unaweza wanted kitu cold to kunywa.
Tom tells you he would not go to Boston unless I go naye.
No one's seeing yao.
Tom aliniambia that he thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he'd certainly do that wiki hii.
That's not responsible yangu.
I think Tom is a student at Harvard.
I don't know I'm doing that wrong njia.
That's the goodst kitu mtu's ever done for me.

Tom alitumia pesa ambazo nyanya yake alikuwa amempa on vitabu.
Hii ni mara ya kwanza nimekuwa mbali na familia yangu kwa zaidi ya majuma matatu.
You should have said so at that time.
Tom and Mary say they'll talk to you tu.
Tom aliniambia hakuwa na kama marafiki wengi kama Mary did.
I've parked the car yangu here mara nyingi and nobody's complaining.
Tom said that he was sorry.
Tom said she didn't think Mary needed to tell John nini to do.
Tom said that he was going to go home.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
I'm going to regret this.
Tom thinks Mary is bored.
Tom thinks Mary would be ready to do so.
Do you have any idea when Tom is planning to get here?
I know you are not planning on staying in Boston.
It wonders if that could happen again.
I guess Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I could't live to look at it.
I think that Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
Uthibitisho uliopo sasa hauwezi kunipa the opportunity to make such a claim.
Tom said she's sure sana Mary has to do that.
Tom would've been happy if you had made that.
Tom said anataka kuongea nawe.
I think you are a doctor.
I don't think Tom knew Mary's phone number.

They are not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect any one to help you.
Did you know that Tom is not planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that is not true.
I know Tom and Mary had already left Australia.
You are not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they feel the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom think you can take care of yourself.
Tom aliniambia that Mary might be wrong.
Tom has decided that he is not going to kazi today.
Tom denied that it was Mary who had asked to do so.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not going to kazi out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Maryfikiri John would not be allowed to do so.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom tells Mary and I that tunapaswa kujaribu kufanya hivyo peke yetu.
You know it's not like that.
I'd have been unable to do that without the msaada wako.
I knew that Tom didn't really want to do that by mwenyewe.
Tom said he's looking up to the kustaafu yake.
Whether you do that sasa or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope mambo remain so.
I should have expected that Tom wouldn't get in line with Mary.
I think it's extremely unlikely that Tom was not aware that he would'd be allowed to enter the museum without the wazazi wake.
I wonder if Tom really knew the combination to this safe.
One's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her to.

I believe Tom is old thirty.
Think about it.
I tell Tom that you'd come to Australia.
I don't think anyone would like Tom.
Nilifikiri Tom tu ndiye aliyejua Mary’s place to live.
I don't think that anyone has ever made that kind of kitu before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That is not one of the things I know how to do.
I think that I'll be able to fix it mwenyewe.
I don't think anyone has done that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary was told she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would've been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom aliniambia that alidhani Mary was insane.
Tom tayari knew that Mary did.
You are not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
Nafikiri ninahitaji mtu wa kunisaidia.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be glad you didn't do that.

It is clear that Tom is not going to do that.
They are not sure that they should do that.

Tom suspected that it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I wote wawili waliketi back.
Tom is wearing the tie that Mary gave to him.
Tom and Mary said that they're not peke yake.
The question is not as much as how it looks.

You're a great mess, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said that he felt insulted.
Tom knew that Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.

Tom knew that there was uwezekano that Mary might do so.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they were not Canadians.

Tom said kwamba Mary knew that huenda hangetaka kufanya hivyo hadi John alipopata wakati wa kumsaidia.
