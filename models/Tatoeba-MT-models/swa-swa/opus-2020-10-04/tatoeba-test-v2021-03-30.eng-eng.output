They let me know that they would not do that.
I'm sorry that I can't come today.

Here's my pink notebook.
Nilijua ningeweza kukutegemea!
I don't think Tom knew what he wanted.
I don't know that Tom didn't need to do that by mwenyewe.
It's not like Tom is going anywhere.
Tom aliniambia that he was hesitant to do so.
I pretended I didn't know nini to do.
I know that Tom is a bum.
I don't think Tom would permit you to do that.
I want to go and change into that shirt I kununua yesterday.
Tom said that he thought Mary was lying.
You must've stayed with you.
I don't think Tom is lonely.
This is not the first time I've done this.
If Tom can't do that, perhaps no other one can either.
Nilifikiri Tom could stop by this afternoon.
And I think that the impact of kiuchumi will be limited.
You should let Tom know that Mary is to do that.
It've been fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to do that any more.
I don't think Tom will need msaada wetu.
Tom said Mary was feeling nervous.
Tom and Mary said they were over thirty.
I think Tom expects Mary to ask that she stay.

I'd never do that to you.
Tom lazima've been quicker at doing that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needed.
Wanajua kwamba wanaweza kufanya vizuri zaidi.

You are tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by yeye mwenyewe?
Tom and Mary say that they have been studying French.
Tom admitted he'd killed Mary.
I'd have been there by now if gari yangu hadn't broken down.
We are ndugu.
I wrote a letter for Tom.
It's going to be hard to find one to take another Tom.
I don't think that giving Tom kisu is a good idea.
I think you were going to kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do that.
It is amazing that walipaswa kuwa na nyumba ya pili in America.
Waliniambia kwamba wameshuka moyo.
Mama cannot drive a car at all.
There's a lot that was happening right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.

Tom must've left the umbrella yake on the bus.
They tell me that they're breaking.
No one ila Tom did that.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that happened.
I pretend you're not interested in going into you.
It's not rahisi to be understood by kila one.
I am hungry.
Tom alisema kwamba alidhani ni yeye tu aliyehitaji kufanya hivyo.
I think kwamba unaweza wanted kitu cold to kunywa.
Tom tells you he would not go to Boston unless I go naye.
No one's seeing yao.

That's the goodst kitu mtu's ever done for me.

You should have said so at that time.

I'm going to regret this.
Tom thinks Mary is bored.
Tom thinks Mary would be ready to do so.
Do you have any idea when Tom is planning to get here?
I know you are not planning on staying in Boston.
It wonders if that could happen again.
I guess Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I could't live to look at it.
I think that Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
Uthibitisho uliopo sasa hauwezi kunipa the opportunity to make such a claim.

Did you know that Tom is not planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that is not true.
I know Tom and Mary had already left Australia.
You are not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they feel the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom think you can take care of yourself.
Tom aliniambia that Mary might be wrong.
Tom has decided that he is not going to kazi today.
Tom denied that it was Mary who had asked to do so.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not going to kazi out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Maryfikiri John would not be allowed to do so.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom tells Mary and I that tunapaswa kujaribu kufanya hivyo peke yetu.
You know it's not like that.
I'd have been unable to do that without the msaada wako.

Think about it.
I tell Tom that you'd come to Australia.

Nilifikiri Tom tu ndiye aliyejua Maryâ€™s place to live.
I don't think that anyone has ever made that kind of kitu before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That is not one of the things I know how to do.
I think that I'll be able to fix it mwenyewe.
I don't think anyone has done that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary was told she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would've been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom aliniambia that alidhani Mary was insane.
Tom tayari knew that Mary did.
You are not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
Nafikiri ninahitaji mtu wa kunisaidia.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be glad you didn't do that.
