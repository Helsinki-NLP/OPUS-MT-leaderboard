I don't understand how this could have happened.
I don't want to be here any more than you do.
Do not want to kazi.
I doubted that Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
Confidently, it will be a challenge to do so.
Confidently, the branch can support the weight of your body.
I doubt that it'll please Tom.
I doubt that it will please Tom.
I doubt that it will please Tom.
I doubt that'll ever change.
I doubt that the police will go to arrest Tom.
And doubt that Tom can do that unless someone helps
Confidently, Tom has the courage to do what we need to do.
And doubt that Tom has to do that again.
Of course, Tom did so kimakusudi.
It is no doubt that Tom is even interested in trying to learn Russian.
And doubt that Tom is still angry.
I doubt that Tom is still single.
Of course, Tom was still unconscious.
Of course, Tom is still single.
Of course, Tom was still upset.
I doubt that Tom really enjoys doing so by yeye mwenyewe.

I doubt that Tom will wait a long time.
And there are no doubt that Tom is about to be allowed to do so.
I doubt that Tom would ever do such a thing.
I doubt that Tom would've had ujasiri to do that.
Of course, you can prove that.
I doubt that you'll be able to do that.
I doubt there's any one to follow me.
Of course, Tom did plan to do so.
Of course, Tom will agree.
Of course, Tom will be offended.
Of course Tom will be reasonable.
Of course Tom will come to Boston mwaka huu.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I doubt Tom will leave on the next time.
Of course Tom will stick around.
And no doubt Tom would be that foolish.
It's doubtful that Tom did that on the kusudi.
Obsessively, Tom will be embarrassed by that.
I doubt the serious that Tom will be excited about that.
I doubt the serious that Tom will be here.
It's a big thing that Tom will be irritated.
It's doubtful that Tom will be mad.
It's a big thing that Tom will be nervous.
I'm doubtful that Tom shall be up at the time of usiku.
I doubt it seriously that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that.
I doubt Tom seriously will be desperate to do so.
I doubt you'll be able to do that today.
I doubt you'll be able to prove that.
Of course, we have been in any danger.
And no doubt you will be happy with the ripoti yangu.
I'd rather do this alone.
I'd rather go swimming.
I'd rather live in a world full of siris than one that's so small that I'm able to understand it.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I earn it like you.
I eat a sushi every chance I get.
I ended up doing something I wish I hadn't done.
It makes me feel good.
I expected Tom wouldn't do anything.
I expect Tom to be crying right now.
If mambo yote yanaenda planned, mimi should be back home tomorrow usiku.
Ikiwa mtu yeyote anaweza kufanya hivyo, unaweza.
If yeyote has any questions, I'll be glad to answer them.
I fear there's been some misunderstanding.
I feel much better today, but sina nguvu za kutosha kufanya kazi.
It is not uncommon for me to get depressed.
It makes me happy to be at home pamoja na familia yangu.
I feel I could've done better.
I feel sure Tom will cry.
I feel feverish.
If I could prove that Tom did that, I'd fire yake.
If I could've spoken French better, I might've collected that kazi.
If I'd had more time, I've written to you.
If I'd known Tom's address, I've written to him.
Kama mimi don't do this, mtu mwingine will have to do it.
If I'd take that plane, I'd not be alive now.
I figured I'd find you here.
I figured I could help.
I figured it had to be good.
I figured that kila one was busy.
I figured Tom would mess up again.
I figured Tom won't know the answer.
I figured Tom would panic.
I figured you might be busy now.
I figured you might know why Tom left early.
I figure that the kura yangu will not change anything.
Ikiwa ningefanya yote niwezayo, huenda ningefaulu.
Kama ningejua, ningalikuambia.
If I had known how to do it, I've made it mwenyewe.
If I hadn't done that, the other one would've.
Kama ningekuwa na pesa, ningenunua kompyuta hii mara moja.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I've arrived soon.
If it's okay for her to buy a kisu, then why on earth can't I?
If it's the one you can do, do it.
Kama si kwa ajili ya jua, sote tungekufa.
If it were possible, mtu would've done it by now.
If I be you, I'd ask Tom to help.
If I were you, I'd quit.
If I were you I would call a doctor.
If mimi be you, I would go nyumbani at the same time.
If I be you, I would not eat any of the mushrooms that Tom picked.
If I be you, I'll be no pitching hema yangu there.
Ikiwa mama yangu angekuwa hai, angenisaidia.
If tu mawazo yangu yangetoka kinywani mwangu kama a ceipt being printed.
Laiti ungalinisaidia jana, tatizo lingeepukwa.
I forgot that today Tom's birthday.
Nilisahau that Tom alikuwa mwalimu.
Nilisahau kwamba tulikuwa na kazi ya shule.
I forgot to buy Tom on his way.
I forgot Tom has been living in Australia.
I forgot to tell Tom I intend to do so.
Nilipata jiwe lililo na umbo la moyo.
I found out Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Iwapo jambo fulani lasikika kuwa zuri sana, basi labda it is.
If they'd know nini was about to happen, wao've changed the mipango yao.
If this is madness, there is a way in it.
If Tom called again, tell him I'm busy.
If Tom can't do that, perhaps no other one can either.
If Tom came, give the note.
If Tom could've talked French, he'd have had more fun.
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't either.
If Tom doesn't help you, I'll help you.
If Tom doesn't help you, I will.
If Tom anafanya hivyo, mimi pia nita.
If Tom angekuwa na kiasi cha fedha, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would've gotten here by now.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would have.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would have.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would've done it.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would've done it.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would've done it.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would've.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would've done it.
If Tom hadn't done it, the other one would've done it.
If we don't find water that we can't drink, we'll survive longer.
If we don't take the threat of a meteor hit seriously, we shall all die.
Ukifanya hivyo, Tom atafikiri kwamba unamchukia.
If you catch a cold, you are not able to get rid of it.
If you'd asked it, I've given it to you.
If you'd have been there, sisi've had good time pamoja.
If you'd helped me, I've succeeded.
If you'd left home a kidogo mapema you would've been on the time.
If you don't go, mimi won't either.
If hutaki to come, don't have to.
Ukifanya hivyo, mimi pia nitafanya hivyo.
Ukifanya hivyo, utajuta juu ya maisha yako yote.
If you kula hii, then I'll eat it, too.
If you had asked for a mashauri yangu, I've advised you not to do that.
Had you been following the mashauri yangu, wouldn't be in such a fix now.
If wewe hadn't turned down Tom when yeye came to you for msaada, no one of the hii would have happened.
Kama ungeniambia mapema, ningalivaa.
Ikiwa una swali, tafadhali put mkono wako.
Mkinihitaji, nitakuja mara moja.
If you're not going, I'm not either.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
If you are not willing to do what you tell you to do, then leave.
If you see Tom today, please tell him that he's invited to party wangu, too.
If you want this pen, I'll lend it to you.
If you wish to leave, huenda.
Nilimpa Tom a baiskeli.
Nilimpa Tom pesa zote nilizokuwa nazo.
I got a baiskeli for Tom.
I got lost in the forest.
It washitimu from the University of Kyoto.
It grew up with the TV shows.
I guarantee that's not going to happen.
I guess it’s too good to be tried.
I guess it’s on time.
I guess it's like that everywhere.
I guess that's not really the muhimu.
I guess you cannot do it.
I guess this is a step in the right direction.
I guess you won't be seeing Tom anytime soon.
I think you cannot do it.
Ilikuwa vigumu kwangu kufanya kazi mvua ilipoanza kunyesha.
I've hoped you'd tell you kila kitu mwenyewe.
Juma lililopita, nilikuwa nimekusudia visit the hekalu.
Nilikuwa na chakula cha mchana saa tatu zilizopita.
Sikujua Tom alikuwa akipanga kumwomba Mary afanye hivyo.

Nimeamua kufanya kazi ngumu.
I missed you too, Tom.
Never before have I been a smoker.
I have never believed Tom.
I have no doubt in mind you are the woman I'm going to marry.
