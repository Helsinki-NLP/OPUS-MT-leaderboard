The delegates of the Wales Council are worried about 'seeming like puppets'
There are concerns among some delegates after the proposal that their position should be changed to the MWP (Messenger of the House of Wales).
This is due to a plan to change the name of the council into the House of Wales.
Delegates of the Council from all politicalngos are concerned that the action will lead to ridicule.
A Leba delegate said his group was worried that the name "is similar to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Swedish twp means fool and pwp means feces.
Plaid's emissary said that the group in general is "not happy" and has proposed a substitute name.
The Haitian emissary said his group was “sound in thought” about the change to the name, but he said it was MWP's shortcut to K puppet.
In this context, the letter w in Swedish is pronounced similar to the letter you are in Yorkshire English.
The council panel, which is currently organizing laws to introduce a change in the name, said: "The final decision on any basic word regarding how the Council’s delegates are spoken of will surely be of the delegates themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government's law gave the House of Wales the authority to change its name.
In June, Jopo published a public opinion based on recommendations that were supported broadly by referring to a council as the House of Wales.
In connection with the position of the Council’s legislature, Jopo favored the delegates of the House of Wales or WMP, but MWP’s choice received further support in public counseling.
As it may seem, the legislators of the Council recommend an alternative choice, but the effort to achieve agreements can be a challenge for the Administrator Elin Jones, amabye is expected to submit the legislature to change within a few weeks.
The laws on change will include other changes in the role of the council, including laws to remove the merits of the Senate and the structure of the committee system.
The delegates of the Council will take the final vote on the name they will be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote on changing the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether they will change the country's name to the "North Macedonian Republic."
This famous vote was set up to settle a decade-up dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The authorities in the city of Athens maintain that the name of neighboring countries in the north represents a challenge to their territory and continues to challenge his request to be a member of the European Union and the NATO Union.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer to the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the referendum.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it takes to change the name so that they can join the EU and the NATO Union.
St. Martin’s bells Go Kimya while Churches in Harlem pass through Chagamoto
"History, the elders with whom I have insulated say that there was a church and a bar in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is none."
He said that the absence of a bar is understandable.
"People walk different ways" in modern times, he said.
"The lights have hesitated to be like a neighbor's living room where people meet frequently."
For the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling wealth will not last as long as leaders too expect, "and soon they will return to their original state."
Churches, he added, may be transformed into huge dumps with private homes that will not help care for the remaining reserves in a neighboring area.
"The majority of people who buy private homes in these constructions will be white," he said, "and this will make it possible for these churches to be closed in general because there is no possibility that people in these halls will be members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white partners before Harlem became a black city of the City Community in 1870 and were named St. Martin a decade later.
The late 1930 ’ s saw the departure of white, or traditional, members of the Methodist Empire.
Black partners sharing in the surrounding area took constructions.
St. Martin was under black allies under Priest John Howard Johnson, who led a retail strike in 125th Street, the main shopping center in Harlem, who refused to hire or associate with black people.
The fire that broke out in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when the members of the priest Johnson church made plans to rebuild it, they gave authority to set up a set of keyboard bells or a diplomatic strategy.
Priest David Johnson, Prince of Priest Johnson and successor of St. Martin, called a set of bells "the poor."
An expert who played the bell set in July called it another name: “The cultural center” and “the irreversible historicity.”
An expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the world’s first bell set by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the largest set at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not look for someone else to replace him.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin for the past several months have been played by architects and contractors, some by church leaders, and others by the Church Diocese.
The presidency body in the parish, which includes church administration - wrote the diocese in July worrying that the diocese “had a plan to move the expense” of the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors sent to them by the diocese.
Some members complained of the absence of transparency from the diocese.
The pope injures a 13-year-old child while diving to cast ropes in Califonia
The pope attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for a rope in Carlifonia on the first day of the lobster season, the officers said.
The invasion took place shortly before 7: 00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV television in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a young man screaming threatening help and then rowed with a team to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only the thrill of straping rope-trees, but "I discovered that he was screaming, 'I’m bitten!
I'm bitten!'
Her shoulder bone had come out," Hammel said she discovered it after she had reached the boy.
"I shouted for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a pope in the water!' Hammel added.
A boy was airborne to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he is listed as in critical situations.
The shark’s inquisitive species are unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a conference by journalists that the pope had seen the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a species of dangerous sharks.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries at the top of his body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the use of drab styles of workers who are assistants.
If a large part of the plan to enter the beauty market of 2.8 billion pounds in Britain, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household equipment decline, large rows of beauty will be tested in 11 stores throughout the country and will be established in more stores the next year if this measure will be successful.
Efficient investments are on the horizon as department stores are looking for ways to fill shelves that were being used to install televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury said that it will double the production of beauty products to 3,000, including such editions as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Chops starting from L'Oreal, Labdalline and Burt's Bees will also find more places with the same typed sites in shops such as Boots.
This large store is also reopening the Shop of various cosmetic products so that many of the products will suit those who do not eat meat that they are under pressure from young shoppers.
In addition, the retail salesman Fragrance Shop will experiment in two Sainsbury shops, the first opened in Croydon, southern London, last week and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the privileges of daily food products in a nearby retail shop mean that supermarkets have to work harder to attract people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive in Sainsbury, has said that a shop will have more appearances as a rental shop with a supermarket pickup trying to cope with Aldi and Lidl by providing more services and nonfood products.
Sainsbury has been setting up small shops at Argos in hundreds of stores and has also created some of the Habitats shops since the purchase of the twourus two years ago, which says that has increased the sale of vegetables and made a service to make customers more useful.
The original attempt of the supermarket to restore its beauty and medicinal properties to life failed.
Sainsbury experimented with the Boots project in the early part of the 2000 ’ s, but the alliance was broken after the crisis arose about how to distribute income from the pharmacy stores in his supermarkets.
A new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury sold his drug - shop business 281 to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
Lloyds is said to be contributing to the plan, adding more expensive facial and skin editions to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have exchanged the appearance of our ranges of beauty to improve the environment of our clients.
We have also put it into professional workers available to offer advice.
Our diverse editions are designed to satisfy all needs and an attractive environment and the right place means that we are now an exhilarating place of beauty which provides a great deal of competition for the original means of making a purchase."
Peter Jones's 'graze' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a business deal of 11 million pounds
Dragons' star Den, Peter Jones was left in ‘grassy’ after a runing announcer Holly Willoughby withdrew from a ultimatum of 11million million pounds and his Fashion edition to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have enough time for their original edition of household goods and earrings.
The two trade was linked to a Goop edition owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
A 37 - year - old The Morning broadcaster wrote in Instagram to announce his departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star "Dragons" Den Peter Jones confused by withdrawing from their grand agenda of the last - to consider his new contracts by Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones "was angry" when this popular girl in raninga admitted at a very anxious meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to be her new business plans - worth to £1.5 million - meant that she would not have enough time to care for their home prints and in the real ear.
The trade had been compared to a Goop edition owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to increase Willoughby's double wealth estimated at £11 million.
When, at the age of 37, Willoughby announced in Instagram that he was leaving the Real business, Jones flew out of England to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: “Alas it was one of Holly’s most concerned points.
It was to be his permanent will that would enable him to continue for more than a few decades to come.
His decision to withdraw left a deep impression on everyone involved.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, the inauguration was very close.
There are warehouses full of goods in Marlow headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning broadcaster, all the most reliable in the United Kingdom, could cost millions of dollars from major investments in goods including rivers, candles, clothes and household items and the possibility of delaying launch.
And it can indicate the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, named Dan Baldwin has been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, became chairman in March.
The couple go on vacation with Jones, who owns 40 percent at Baldwin Running plant.
Willoughby is expected to be an ambassador for the MاS type and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source of news near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his business."
Adapted conversation 'and then we loved each other'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media agencies by commenting on what others would consider to be the "unworthy president" and by praising the leader of North Korea.
Why is President Trump more desperate?
Trump said in his sneering voice “a journalist”.
"I haven't despaired of anything."
He suggested that Kim prefers to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapuri in June to be praised by Trump as a major step in removing nuclear weapons from North Korea.
But there is a halt in the debate over nuclear disarmament.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapuri, the famous North Korean ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North Korean nation has not seen the "comproper step" from the United States for the initial steps of disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, Marekena has developed obstacles that aim to increase pressure.
Trump had a hopeful attitude in his speech at a public meeting.
"We're doing well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions would lose their lives.
Now we've started a good team."
His efforts to improve cooperation with Kim, he said, have resulted in positive results — the success of rocket experiments, helping with the release of hostages and helping to help restore the dead bodies of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It is very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out in this crowded stadium, we would have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia’s Tsunamis and Earthquakes — Making a Difference on Island, Killing Hundreds of People
After an earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign foreign government agencies were told that they were unnecessary.
Even though more than 10 percent of the Lombok people had been deported, no national disaster was announced, a condition needs to encourage international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have become very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, and that’s a challenge." Mrs. Sumbung said.
While the organization Save the Children sits together to travel to Palu, you are not sure whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for a national disaster organization, said Indonesian officials were considering the situation in Palu to see that international organizations would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
As a result of the frequent earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the same country has remained in disorganized due to natural disasters.
Although shelters from tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are not so common in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami alarms in Palu, even though warning was in effect, may have contributed to disaster.
In the best of circumstances, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate the transportation process.
The hospital ship at Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the infrastructure that took over in Indonesia as the focal point of your election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on road and rail construction.
But financial shortages have been a challenge to Mr Joko's government as he approaches elections next year.
Mr Joko also has to deal with pressure from the sectors, where many Muslim participants have been very conservative.
More than 1,000 people were killed and dozens of nobles were taken away from their homes when groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets, with swords, bows, and arrows and other sharp weapons.

I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have comments that are important for research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
This afternoon friends who believe they know a woman have come to the scene to ask questions about the place where she was located this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police say they are in a process to inform family members.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his house but is told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or get out of the building.

Cromwell's image in Parliament is being the latest reminder of the crisis of 'reviving history'.
His removal will be a fair right for Taliban’s similar destruction of the art of most of the British religious and pastoral art carried out by its fanatic members of the Puritans.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick’s proposal as "traditional" and "will respond to revisiting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of images as an image of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
Destruction of images in British civil wars was neither ordered nor implemented by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst for Cromwell would have been the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the past century.
The impressive representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is a testimony to the views of the 19th century and part of the history of one who believes is still worthy of being celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a legislator from outside pressure, which was a source of royal leadership for him.
Whether the whole is an accurate representation of the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is evident is that the mid - 17th - century conflict has laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is a personal person identified with a single unit in these colonies.
His success as Lord Watchman is also worthy of being celebrated and celebrated."
Pig Killer Amng'ata and Killing Chinese Farmer
The farmer was attacked and killed by pigs at the market in southwest China, according to news reports in the area.
The man, who was renamed "Yuan," was found dead with a bloodied vein near a pig shed at a market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, a South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in the pig chamber on May 20, 2005, at Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
On Wednesday he was said to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and the door of a neighboring pig shed was open.
He said that in the pig shop there was a pig that had blood in his mouth.
The study confirmed that the 550 poundsn pig had digested and killed the farmer, according to reports.
"My cousin’s legs were bloodied and broken," the cousin, referred to by his first name as "Wu," said, as he was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
A video from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The manager of the market told the Evening News that the pig had been tied in a long distance to prevent him from serving another person, when the police gathered a witness in the area.
The Yuan family and the market hoards are reportedly debating about her death.
Although rare in many cases, pig attacks have been recorded in the past.
In 2016 a pig invaded a woman and her husband in their garden in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound pig pushed a Swedish farmer against his tractor until his wife startled him and ran away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not generally aggressive but if they taste blood may be "stirring."
"They're just playing.
They are sniffing, and curious... they are not willing to injure you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bringing heavy rains throughout the southwestern United States
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa continues to deteriorate as it passes over more water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the hurricane Rosa will bring flooding rains throughout northern Mexico and the south of the United States for a few days to come.
Hurricane Rosa was a cyclone of 85 mph, Type 1, at 5: 00 a.m. on Sunday, and it appeared 385 miles [385 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the pressure of the atmosphere has begun to circulate over the Pacific Ocean and head east toward the Western Coast of the United States. While Rosa is nearing the Baja California peninsula on Monday if a tropical storm begins to push tropical moisture north to the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring to 10 countries of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Next, the tropical moisture that begins to intercept with the pressure approaching the atmosphere will cause plenty of rain to come in the South west in the days to come.
In the interior, rainfall from 1 to 4 countries will result in deadly floods, mud slides, and possible desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 countries per hour in one area, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that the rainfall rates of between 2 and 4 countries in the southwestern part of the world, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding can result from worsening conditions as a result of dense tropical rain conditions.
Going out in the desert on foot as a result of the danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can cause massive rivers and thunderstorms to give rise to strong winds and scattered dust particles.
The surrounding atmosphere will bring abundant rainfall to some of the coastal regions of South California.
Over half the country’s total rainfall may result, which can cause a slight slope of mud and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some of the high - rise tropical rain showers will begin on Arizona later on Sunday and Monday aspiration, before the rains will expand later on Mondays and Tuesdays.
On Tuesdays to Wednesday, torrential rains will cover four corners.
In October it may take a high temperature change throughout the United States while Akitiki heat is cooling down, but the tropics will remain temperate.
This sometimes causes sudden temperature changes within a short distance.
There is a good example of a sudden difference in temperature throughout the United States on Sunday.
There is almost a 20 - degree difference in temperature between Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
For the next few days, the approaching summer heat will try to spin and spread again.

More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s trial
More than 20 million people saw a massive witness on Thursday by Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh and his sexual abuse woman who is said to have occurred in the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blasey Ford, in six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, as broadcasters interrupted the regular sessions to light the last stage of Friday: the agreement implemented by the Arizona Senate, Jeff Flake for FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh took her secret places when she was drunk and tried to remove her from a high school ceremony.
Kavanaugh, who gave powerful evidence, said he had 100 percent confidence that the matter did not happen.
As reported by Nielsen on Friday, more than 20.4 million people are more likely to look at.
The company was counting average viewing at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Statistics were not immediately obtained from other networks that broadcast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen is often faced with the problem of counting the people who look at it in afician way.
To put this in the right perspective, hio is a status equivalent to the audiences of an economist soccer game or the School Awards.
Fox News, whose referendum has been strongly supported by Kavanaugh's appointment, conducted an average of 5.69 million netizens during the same day trial, Nielsen said.
The ABC was the second to 3.26 million spectators.
The CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Anticipation remained over the trial.
Flake was the theme in the same Friday case.
After the average Polish official reported that he would be supporting the appointment of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while on a trip to the Court Committee.
He stood on the ground for several minutes while being rebuked, which was directly shown at the CNN station.
"I am standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
He was told, "You are strong when most women are powerless."
Flake said that her physics had made a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that she would have much to say in a committee case.
The advertising media and the cable were all shining directly hours later, while the Court Committee was voted to continue Kavanaugh's appointment for full vote.
But Flake said he could do so with the consciousness that the FBI could investigate the charges against a select one in the next week, which few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake’s conversation with her friend, Mwanademocrat Seneta, made some impressions on her.
After a discussion with Coons and several managers later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's elections were strong, since it was clear that the Citizens would have few votes to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened a survey through the FBI about the charges against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister May has accused the opposition of ‘politicalism’ in regard to Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of his plan to withdraw from the European Union for "political activities" and the British nobility and to defame national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrive at the Conservative Party Summit in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview near her on the front page of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs Boris Johnson insisted her attack on Cheqisers' plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the European Union should collect an allocation is "empty nonsense."
Vide Sims shot: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of the Wayde Sims, 20-year-old LSU basket player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the war.
Police got glasses from the attack area and said they found Simpson’s DNA on the glasses, the CBS agency, said.
After interviewing Simpson, the police admitted to shooting the Wayde.
His sister has been set to be 350,000, a lawyer reported.
Eastern Baton Rouge’s suicide investigator released the first report on Friday, saying that the reason for death is a bullet wound on the head inside the neck.
The department congratulates the unit of the Louisiana State Police, a police criminal laboratory, police police at the Southern University and citizens of the region for helping in a survey that led to the arrest of an suspect.
LSU director Joe Alleva thanked the regional law sheet for "zeal and exercise justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6 - to 6 - foot player was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played on the LSU basket team.
He found an average of 5.6 and 2.6 points in a game of ball in the past season.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball team said the team was "hurt" by the killing of the Wayde.
"Such things are a constant concern," said Wade.
Volcanoes hurl ash over Mexico City
Dusts drawn from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached neighboring areas of southern Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Antidepression warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity within the crater and recorded 183 times of gas and ash production for more than 24 hours.
The center was following many thunders and vibrations.
Photos on social networks showed thin ash covering car mirrors in nearby Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in the activity on a volcano that is found at 45 miles (720 km) southeastern of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude occurred in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police fight against the Catalan civilists to separate before the national freedom of vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after freedom protestors protested against the protest police while thousands joined protests to mark the first year of Katalunya's secession.
A group of protesters wearing separate marionettes stopped by police to beat them with eggs and paint them with flour, which resulted in black dust clouds in the streets that would normally host many tourists.
Then, too, riots broke out later that day, with the police using their rods in the face of conflict.
For more than hours the disassociated groups saying "No forgiveness, no forgiveness" faced advocating protests saying, "Shispania constantly."
Fourteen people received treatment with minor injuries from demonstrations, local media reports.
Concern remains high in the region for freedom a year after the October 1 referendum that was considered illegal and official in Madrid but celebrated by the Jesuits in favor of separatism.
Voters chose a large amount of freedom, although the number of people that appeared lower and those who object to isolation were neglecting to vote in large numbers.
According to Kikatalunya authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region and cause violent violence.
Proponents were camping all night on Friday to stop protests to help the national police.
Protests continued but had to take a different approach.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who attended a seclusion march said he no longer hoped for the independence of Katalunya.
"Last year we lived in the best of life.
I watched my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we are stuck," she said.
Despite the most important victory in the last regional election in December, Catlunya's party has failed to maintain its speed this year while most of the best-known leaders are in exile for wish or in detention waiting for a trial for a referendum and a later release.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic recording a protest supporting the police on her phone, said that the crisis was caused by politicians from both.
"The island keeps increasing more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of ninekatalunya leaders in the pre - trial jail since late last year, announced that he would hold a seat for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as the European Parliament's candidate is the best way to refuse the reversal of democratic values and oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga calls Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
The first Dolly Menga for Livingston confirmed victory
Livingston upstairs surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard’s second defeat in 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
It was the Dolly Menga’s case that divided the results between both teams while Gary Holt's team was moving and held in second place like Hibernian.
Gerrard's team is losing its grip on foreign matches in the Great League this season and will face the leaders Hearts, who are in front of them for eight points, the next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be the Rapid Viennans in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston have increased the number of non-social matches in the bridge, where the head cocha Holt has not yet failed since Kenny Miler’s position last month.
Livingston misses a chance against mild visitors
The Holt team had to be long before fasting, with its direct attack causing Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson could get a chance but missed the aim for his scraper passed in front of the goll, and Alan Lithgow could only play the ball out after jumping in to meet the ball of head from Craig Halkett.
The local people did not look nervous and allow Rangers to own a game, knowing that they could interfere with visitors with the use of casting caps.
And in this way they were able to tie a doughnut.
Rangers were punished with the striker and Livingston to try to get a lantern, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined in giving Menga the opportunity, who touched and sealed the bao from the middle of the case.
In the meantime, Rangers had controlled the ownership of rubber but failed to penetrate the protective stronghold of the home team and the gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not troubled for a long period of game,
The style continued during the second period, although Alfredo Morelos had to get Kelly to save her mites.
Scott Pittman was prevented from tying the feet of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow took the ball out after another Livingston game.
The attacks continued to scramble the Livingston team box and continued to be removed, while two penal charges - after Halkett dropped the treasurer Glenn Middleton, and the other about holding the ball by hand were ignored.
'Certainly' from Livingston--reason
Alasdair Lamont of Scotland's BBC in Tony Macaroni
Wonderful work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had the best game and kept on expecting and rising up to the table.
Their sporting style with the team has changed little since the return to the main league, but most compliments go to Holt in the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett made a big contribution, owning a more well - organized security fortress, when Menga kept everything in front of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
Rangers were unable to move, however.
As they have been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under those standards.
They missed the last touch at the gate - once they were able to create a place in the home team's fortress - and hio is a challenge for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a different welcome in Cologne
Saturday (September 29) saw a smile and a blue sky when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany - which aims to rehabilitate relations between the two NATO members.
They have differed on issues including human rights, press freedom and the European Unionization of Turkey.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The town is home to the largest population of Turkians outside Turkey.
Police mentioned security reasons as a barrier for 25,000 people not to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters appeared in the vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of them in Kurdish also made their voices heard, alarming Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome her into the country.
The two demonstrations indicate a division about the attitude of the president who appears to be a hero to some German Turks and was rocked by others as a dictator.

Long Lartin Prison : Six officials in violence · Global Voices
Six prison officials have been injured in a riot in a high security prison, says the Prison Office.
A riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
Experts "Tornado" have been brought to deal with the riot, which involves eight prisoners and has been held in a single prison razor.
The officials were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for Jela Ministry said: "Eliders with prison training have been brought in to deal with what is happening in HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated with minor injuries.
We do not support the violence in our prisons and it is clear that those involved will be taken to the police and can be more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June the governor of the prison was reported to have received hospital treatment after an attack by a prisoner.
And last October the protest officials were called to prison to deal with a serious crisis in which workers were attacked by tableballs.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Ghafla Floods (Gangan Ways Can Benefit)
Not usually the depression of tropical pressure from Arizona, but that is exactly what may happen early next week when the remaining forces of Hurricane Rosa pass through the West Desert and cause the danger of sudden flooding.
The National Climate Service has already issued a warning of sudden floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later on Monday with it rain.
The Phoenix National Climate Service explains on Twitter that "10 tropical countries have maintained storms and reduced pressure levels within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
A recent example of Hurricane National Center forecasts 2 to 4 countries' rainfall, along with a few to 6 countries at Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the Western Desert along with the Great Basin Rockies have the potential of 1 to 2 countries and 4 countries.
For those who are outside the danger of sudden flooding, hurricane Rosa can be a blessing because the area is experiencing a drought.
Although floods are a source of great concern, some of these rainfalls can be beneficial because South West are witnessing conditions of drought.
More than 40 percent of Arizona is witnessing at least severe drought, the second highest type," the weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to the ground across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still powered by a hurricane on Sunday morning and 85 miles per hour [85 km / hr], is located 385 miles [385 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is traveling north at six miles [12 km] an hour.
Storms encounter heavy water in the Pacific and thus lose power.
Thus, Mexico is expected to reach the ground with the power of tropical storms during or late Monday evening.
Rain in some parts of Mexico can be large and most dangerous to floods.
"The rain level of 3 to 6 countries is expected from Baja California to go to Sonora in the north west with the potential to reach 10 countries," the weather.com reported.
Rosa then heads north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizonan border on Tuesday morning as a depression of tropical pressure and then up through Arizona and southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The main threat expected from the hurricane Rosa or its remains is heavy rain in Baja California, north west Sonora, and the Northwest Desert of Sonora and the United States. The Desert Southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
Rain is expected to result in sudden flooding of life and mud slides in deserts and landslides in the highlands.

Trump says Kavanaugh was shown, selfish and angry'
"The vote of Justice Kavanaugh is a referendum against Democrat's brutal and horrifying tactics," Trump said at Wheeling, Virginia West.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been “past the selfishness and anger” of the Democrat Party during his entire selection process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Parliament on Thursday, firmly and emotionally rejecting claims from Christine Blasey Ford that he had abused her sexually decades ago when they were young.
Ford also witnessed in a trial for her claims.
The president said on Saturday that Kavanaugh's "Americans saw the intelligence and courage" on that day.
"Conversation for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of our current intellectuals, a lawyer with a good record of public services," told a crowd of West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's appointment indirectly as he discussed the importance of the Republican supporters coming out to vote in the elections of representatives.
"Five years from now one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't argue, but in another attitude I am really running for it," she said.
"That means I’m going around to debe good candidates."
Trump said that the Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
The first crucial vote of procedures in the Senate's Parliament about Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, the GOP's headmaster has told CNN.
Hundreds are killed in the earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and the number of casualties.
At least 384 people were killed, many were killed when waves reached the shore, when a massive earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the coast at Palu on Friday when 20 feet [6 m] of waves (18 m] swept the land at night and swept away many and destroyed them and everything that was around them.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the tsunami threat hit yesterday, people were still on the coast and didn’t immediately run away and they were affected," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster prevention organization BNPB said at a conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami did not come alone, came in cars, logs, houses, affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had flowed into the open sea at an speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Some people planted trees to escape the tsunami and to save themselves, he said.
At least 16,700 people were moved to Palau, the city of 24 stations.
Aerial images taken by the disaster organization featured monstrous buildings and shops, bridges were overthrown and sank by an oasis surrounded by water.
Small vibrations were heard in this coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Tathmini and Use of Technology (BPPT) reported that the energy released by the great Friday earthquake was nearly 200 times more powerful than the atom bomb blasted Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geography, which may be located at the end of a thin cat, was responsible for an increase in tsunamis, it said.
Nugroho described the devastation as "particular" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
.. The bodies of some victims were found stuck in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage can be greater along the 300 - mile (190 km) coast in northern Palu, a region called Donggala , which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely maimed without any notice" from Donggala , Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that workers and volunteer workers were moving to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it could be worse," she said.
The agency on Saturday was badly criticized for not informing that the tsunami had attacked Palu , although leaders said the waves arrived shortly after warning was issued.
In an unexploited video shared on social media, a man at the upper floor of the building can be heard shouting the warnings of a tsunami approaching to people on the street.
Within minutes the tide reaches the coast and carries buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm this video.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused electricity loss in the wide area that disrupted communication near Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send cargo and relief supplies from Jakarta and other towns, which the authorities said, but the exiles still need food and other basic needs.
The town airport has been opened only with relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia’s Tsunami Diaspora Increases by over 800.
It’s So Bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala managed safely in Palu, where workers sheltered in tents laid out of their affluence, they reviewed the devastating events along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many destroyed homes" he said.
It’s terrible.
Even though relief groups began relief operations, some complained that deep - minded foreign workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's laws, money, equipment and personnel from abroad can only start if the disaster declares to be national.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arrini, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government has said, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open for international aid but there is no such thing."
As the second night engulfed Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those missing were hopeful that their loved ones would meet and make it a miracle in their fairy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was found out from a sewer.
On Sundays rescue workers rescued the woman who had been in the shadow of the debris for two days and her mother’s body near her.
Gendon Subandono, a team of the national Iindonesia parapet team, had trained two skiers who were missing for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped in Roa Roa Roa Hotel, together with Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in an umbrella field, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon explained how, hours after the report about the Roa Roa Roa's Hotel spread among the party members in an umbrella game, he had sent WhatsApp’s message to the Palu contestants, who were participating in the coastal festival.
Its message, however, showed a gray mark, not two blue markings.
"I think that means that the message was not read," she said.
Thieves take $26,750 to fill an ATM in the Newport of Levee
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from Brink's staff while filling ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The car driver was removing money from ATM in the entertainment theater and providing more money for the installation, Spanier Dennis McCarthy wrote in a report.
While dealing, someone else "run from the back of Brink's employee" and stole the money pockets intended to be shipped.
The Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, according to reports, but the police did not describe the actual number of people involved in the event.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police via 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: An apparition artist changes his name to Ye
An abrupt Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Advertising the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creation known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye’s nickname for a while and has used it as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
This change takes place before it appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He takes the place of singer Ariana Grande on an occasion who regrets "emotional reasons," the show nurse said.
Despite being abbreviated by his current professional name, West has long said that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe it is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the name of the album and the radio producer Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means a special person, and simply being a model of our good deeds, our badness, our confusion, everything.
That's more like what we are."
He is one of the most famous of the skirmishes who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his privileges by name, Love and Brother Love.
Former West member JAY-Z has also had to use his name with a footnote or without a large letter.
AMOLO from Mexico promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against civilians as the country nearly marks the 50th anniversary of the bloody crimes against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will not use the army to combat the people of Mexico."
Armed forces shot at peaceful protests in a building on October 2, 1968, and killed some 300 people while left - handed students were deep in South America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly support to students and opening unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double the A.I philanthropy.
While China is becoming more involved in the imagination, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in research in the same fields, said investor and expert AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments are coming after various U.S. government units broadcast AI, even though the United States in general lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year: and aims to be 1 in the AI discovery by 2030.
"Swifting the AI budget will be a good start, as it is that all other countries are behind the US and we are looking for new inventions in AI," Lee said.
Adding double money may double the chance that the coming AI will be achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has placed in one of the most famous AI companies in China, Face +++.
In the 1980 ’ s at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an AI system that won the U.S. top - ranking Othello and later became an active member of the Microsoft Research and the president of Google’s China branch.
Lee admitted that the technology competition of the original U.S. government, like that of the Robot Society for the National Protection Research Plans, asked to know when the next race will be, to help identify the experts who are coming.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to provide government aid, Lee said.
"Not China that takes professional leaders, it's companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said the change in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen his efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be given directly to PhD students in AI," she said.
The Chinese Country Committee issued its Protocol Development Program in Judicial Minds in July 2017.
The National Institute of Chinese Science offers money to people in educational institutions the same as the dedication to Natural Sciences and other government agencies makes money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of professional work is as low as China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Centre for Cooperation in False Minds, which aims to associate members from the White House with scholars and the White House announced the formation of the Consensus Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI Next initiative.
For NSF, it now produces more than $100 million each year in AI research.
At the same time, U.S. law that wanted to create a National Security Commission in the False Mind has not moved for months now.
Macedonian referendum voters about the change in the name of the country.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday about the change of its name as the "North Dodoni" that could resolve the conflict of many years with Greece that prohibits his call for membership in the European Union and the NATO.
Greece, the province of Macedonia, has retained the name of a neighboring country in the north represents a challenge to its province and has challenged the country’s request to be a member of the NATO and the EU.
The two governments came to terms in June according to the newly proposed name, but the national opposers say the change will undermine the tribal identity of most Slavic peoples in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in a referendum and the discount campaign has raised doubts about whether voters will reach the 50% level required for the referendum to be correct.
A question in the referendum reads: "Are you supporting the NATO and the EU and agreeing to an agreement with Greece."
Celibacy supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a fitting guarantee to be accepted into such institutions as the European Union and the NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries formed by the disintegration of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the European Union umbrella because that step means a safe life for all of us," said 79 - year - old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
While it is not legally recognized, enough legislative members have said that they will support the electoral results to increase their weight.
Changes in the name will require support by two thirds of the votes in parliament.
The National Elections Commission said there has not been any reports of lawlessness by 1: 00 p.m.
However, the number of voters was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
""I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia to change the country's name to open up the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was organizing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents made by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We are joining NATO with the European Union, but we want to join willingly, not through the back door under pressure" said Kavadarkov.
"We are poor countries, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to register us as Macedonia, we can join China and Russia to be part of Euro-Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO's membership will result in a highly-needed investment in Macedonia, which has a 20 - percent unemployment rate.
"I believe a large number will support because 80% of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said that the result of "that" would be "evident evidence of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Politic Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - below levels .
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian Telma television, found that 57 percent of the members planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said yes to vote.
The poll should be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure of the referendum will represent the first major impact on the government's Western policy since it took control last May.
Note: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City surrounds the entire Brighton fortress and closes the bao
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated the guards of Brighton's bench in a match that Manchester City won 2-0 Saturday in the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very simple when he closed the bao in the 65th minute.
Ajentina’s attacker found a iron in the middle of the arena and started a series.
He passed between Brighton’s three batteries, before passing through the open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
She pushed one card and then outlived them more rapidly at the edge of Brighton gatebox.
Then he ironed on his left side, and found Sterling.
The British attacker first used his touch in a box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot around Brighton Mathew Ryan’s gatekeeper and the tarpaulin inside the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his legs," City's manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55 minutes, 60.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that she closed the ball at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues team the first control in the junior of the Great League.
The sign closed in 29 minutes.
Aguero received rubber inside Brighton during the attack.
He ironed a fine cedar across the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before she gave him a pasi Sterling on the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacker touched a ball in a net before celebrating it.
City is fighting Hoffenheim at Mabingw League match at 12:55pm Tuesday afternoon in Rhein-Neckar-Isna in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be corrupt against.
While the Nationals were already removed from dating, he had no other reasons for for for for for for for for for forcing another start.
But the most competitive Scherzer hopes to be an obstacle on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a devastating effect on the rockies, who are proud of having one game against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies won 5-2 winning a winning game against the National on Friday night, but they are still seeking the first crown in the bridge.
"Even though we don't play anything, at least we can play a hard game in view of the situation here in Denver and the crowd and the other team will be playing at the top of every level I will face this year .
Why don't I want to compete in that scale?"
National has still not announced players who start playing on Sunday, but they say they have wanted to let Scherzer jump the ball in that situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, trained to launch on Thursday and will be throwing on his day’s rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hand player has 18-7 and an average of 2.53 margins and 300 points of abuse of beatings at 220 2/3 this season.
Trump holding a meeting in West Virginia
The president made indirect reference to the situation facing his client Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he discussed the importance of Republican citizens to appear in large numbers in the elections of representatives.
"All the success we received is at risk in November.
Five weeks from the most important elections in our lives.
This one major, big election -- I don't charge but in another view I really run and that's why I’m all around to call for good candidates," she said.
Trump continued, "You see this frightening, horrrifying group of Democrats, you are doing it right now.
And they have decided to take power by any means possible, with the ability to see selfishness, depravity.
They care about people who hurt him, who wrong him in order to gain power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said, the Democrats are willing to "oppose and prevent."
"And you can see that in the past four days," he said, calling the Mexicans "anger and obsessive and rebellious and liars."
He mentioned a member of the Senate Court Committee who is Dianne Feinstein by name, which made him polite.
"Remember his reply?
Did you expose the documents in a wrong way?
Uh, uh, what is it.
No, not, I waited for one--that was the very weak language of the body--the worst language I have ever witnessed."
The Leba Party is no longer a church.
It does not tolerate freedom of thought
When the Momentum activists of the local party voted to get rid of me, it was not surprising.
After all, I am one of the Leba Parliamentary line told that we don't want to bekani - all by speaking our thoughts.
My partner in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because he stood up for his rebellion against sectarian discrimination.
In my case, the suggestion to get rid of me was disgruntled by not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of economic policy, on national security, on the issue of Europe, the issue is that the issue is similar to what Jeremy and the previous leaders have to say.
A report to the Leba meeting in Nottingham East on Friday explained that "we want the meetings to be both meaningful and meaningful."
For more than eight years as the regional MP of Leba, the GC's Friday night meetings have been summarizing this.
Sadly today, it did not resemble many meetings and the political promises "meek, generous" have long forgotten if, indeed, it had begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not accepted in Leba and all opinions are taken as well if they are accepted by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as my partner who I thought we shared the same political perspective began to expect me to change ideas completely and take positions that I would never agree with - be it a national security or a market in the European Union.
Whenever I talk in public - and it doesn’t matter what I say - what follows is insults on social media and efforts not to be elected, reject middle-hand politics, and tell me I shouldn’t be in the Leba party.
And it’s not the situation I’ve been through alone.
In fact, I know I am more fortunate than others because the view directed to me is political.
I respect the skills and opinions of others who face daily sexual or racial insults but never give up.
One of the disappointments in modern politics is how the standards of violence are viewed as normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Leba party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a church in addition to every "disbelief" debate or change in the principles of selection, the party becomes thinner in the category.
I have received much advice over the past two years when I am urged to stay calm, not to talk too much and that "I'm going to be fine."
But I did not get involved in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Leba party 32 years ago as a school student, because of the pressure to be ignored by the Socher government that left my whole school in the lurch, I have tried to fight for the best public services for those who need them most — the regional council or government minister.
I haven't kept my politics secret, including the previous elections.
No one in the East Nottingham could be confused about the current policy and climate dissatisfaction with current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I will say is that as the European Union nears the end of almaarufu Brexit, a step that will hurt the family, our business and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the Leba.
But really one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for the people in my area, whether members of the Leba party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no amount of terror or political fitness will prevent me from considering what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The unfunctioned Ayr Tim still takes first place at the table table
Two experiments in the time of the end may have changed to some degree the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this most expected exciting game of Tennent League.
Now they lead the table, a special team that has not failed.
Eventually, it was their best protection , and so the use of their spaces, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be content.
"We've been tried in our games up till now, and yet we haven't failed, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Ayr, the Ayr, took advantage of their best position."
Grant Anderson’s attempt, closed in the 14th minute by Frazier Clormo, put Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scotlandn team player Rory Hughes, presented for game and Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have a large number of players and Jason Baggot made an attempt that was not closed.
Clifo added Ayr's leadership for the penalties, just before the interval, closed and then completed the experiment alone and made a mark of 17-5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose had a good start with Patrick Anderson’s attempt, by Baggot, to reduce the leadership by five points.
Then the game was suspended after the deadly wound to Ruarid Knott, who was demoted when the game was reintroduced, Ayr added his leadership to a test by Stafford McDowall, by Clormo.
The captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson and was given a yellow card and over again, Melrose seized the chance to have one more player and closed it up with Bruce Colvine’s experiment, at the end of a time of intense pressure.
The house team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to play against Clormo without rubber and out of the penal line, MacPherson fasted due to a violent attack from Ayr.
Clifo fasted, how he was doing after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong’s scraper and joking Gregor Henry and shut down a fifth attempt on the home team.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia, with no port, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific sea
Sailors at world headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings display a blue flag like a sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are written the saying: "The sea is ours right.
Restoration is a duty."
Kote in unported Bolivia, the memory of Chile's coastline lost in the 19th - century resource crisis is still clear - just like anticipation of sailing again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps that hope is now higher for many years, as Bolivia awaits the decision of an international justice court on October 1 after five years of discussion.
"Bolivia is fast, united spirit and quiet and has a positive outlook for results," said Roberto Calzadilla , Bolivian diplomatic.
Most of Bolivian citizens will watch the ICJ decision on a large screen across the country, sending that court in The Hague will make a decision that agrees to Bolivia’s demands - after decades of appropriate conversation - Chile will be forced to discuss the process of giving Bolivia access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the native president of Bolivia - who is facing a heated confrontation in next year’s election - also has much to do with Monday’s decision.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he swore in late August.
But some critics believe that the court is less likely to make the right decision for Bolivia - and that even if it decides to do so, there will be little change.
The based organization in the Netherlands has no authority to expand Chile to other countries, and it says it cannot tell the outcome of the conversation that is expected.
The ICJ decision will be issued just six months after the last discussion showed that the case was "not complex," said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert in international law.
And besides promoting Bolivia’s hopes, the past four years may have been reversed.
"The issue of access to the sea is misappropriated by the current Bolivian regime," said Zárate .
Morales' political words have ended Chile's remaining good intentions, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some time continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to engage in discussion after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court decisions were swift.
On Monday it will give Bolivia "a wonderful release of the new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "put an end to 139 years of conflict for common gain," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - is still one of the most famous presidents in South America - was using the maritime issue as a political current.
"Bolivia will never give up on her right to reach the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to recognize that we need to go forward."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it believes in the United States
North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never remove its nuclear weapons first if it cannot put faith in Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called for America to follow promises made during a meeting in Singapuri among leaders.
His comment comes as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to launch a nuclear diploma that had failed for more than three months after the Syngapur meeting with North Korean president Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a small blunder" that promoting US sanctions and opposition to the report ending the Korean War will ever weaken the North.
Washington is afraid of accepting information without Pyongyang first doing the necessary steps to disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump all want a second meeting.
But there is serious doubt that Pyongyang takes into account the action of removing the weapons that the country considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang the next month to organize the second meeting of Kim-Trump.
A fashion exhibit in Paris shows modern head items leading to the Royal Stores near you
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or block the sun at all, you are looking for a solution.
The experts Valentino and Thom Browne launched huge head items at their convention SS19 at a stage concert that surprised them with design in the Style Wiki in Paris.
Hard - to - design hats have attracted many in Instagram during this summer and these designers have donated these beautiful hats to the fashion stage.
Valentino’s magnificent wardrobe was a brown hat lined with thick, furlike fringes that covered the heads of models.
Other major devices include tickets, a witch’s hat and even a pineapple - but not designed to heat your head.
Thom Browne also uncovered strange landfills - when Halloween is approaching.
Many colored Barakoa had woven lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than fashion skills
One design was similar to a snorkel with a sliver and eyeglasses, while the other was similar to a melted ice cream shell.
And if you continue to report a major fad--you have luck.
Fashion viewers predict that large stalactites may be on their way to the state - of - the - art shops near you.
A huge hat gives creative ideas in 'La Bomba', a straw hat with the two-pipe edges and sends everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Labo supporters made this intricate hat that was released on social media made another great idea to be used on the stylus-cramble-crambling-large-crambled costumes.
The orange raffia bag, set up on the edge by a leather handle, was the highlight of the Jacquemus' SS Riviera in Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion expert Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see a large hat and grey bags arriving at the stores next summer - because the architect has brought a big impact that will be difficult to ignore the needs of large materials.'
John Edward: Language skills are important to international citizens · Global Voices
Uskoti's independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional skill and this has continued in the year 2018 with a different set of quality tests, which are strengthened by personal and joint achievements in sports, art, music and other social efforts.
Despite the increase of more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the School of Independent Schools in Scotland (alarmous SCIS), are striving to provide a better service rate for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to provide their students with more education and higher education, the fields they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can create and carry out a special school course, we see modern languages continue to grow in popularity and a privileged subject at school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes on his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, that's going to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely on English when we want to build bonds of faith with people from other countries.
As a result of the recent results of this year’s test, we can see that languages guide the ligi table with high grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students found a high A mark.
A data collection from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students received the upper A forum in Mandarin and 72 percent for those learning German, 69 percent for those learning French and 63 percent for Spanish learners as well as A.
This shows that independence schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital knowledge that children and teenagers will need in their future.
Languages now, as a chosen course, are being taken at the same rate as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the British Commission on Ajira and Masters in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they have to have when they have difficulty filling jobs, 17 percent were associated with a lack of linguistic skills .
So more and more, language skills are essential to providing youths with their later skills.
While many opportunities for work are needed in language, this knowledge is vital in the world of excellence.
No matter what field one chooses, if they have learned the second language, they will have a more real opportunity in the future to acquire a knowledge of life like this one.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners will put a person who speaks different languages ahead in a contest.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language in order to carry on conversation in French, the only language spoken by two percent, 15 percent.
That’s why putting in language studies is now important for the current children.
Having many languages, especially those in the developing world, will give children a fine opportunity to find meaningful employment.
Inside the Scotland, each school will have a different language that teaches.
A number of schools will focus on more modern languages, where others will teach languages that seem more important to Britain in the future to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s welfare, there will always be a number of independent languages, as well as experts in this field.
Uskoti's independent schools offer to provide a learning environment that will provide children and give them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their future skills.
It cannot be denied that at this moment, in the context of international trade, languages are becoming more important in the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "an international knowledge of communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, contrast with quality for the youth of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the School of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron play his first game with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is about to end for eager fans to see LeBron James playing the first match as Los Angeles Lakers.
The coach of Lakers Luke Walton has announced that James will play before the seasonal game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is still uncertain how much time she will play.
"It will be more than a minute and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell explained in Twitter that James can play a few minutes.
Following the training early this week, James was asked about his plans in Lakers' schedule of "six before the season.
"I don't need the games before the season at this stage of my sport so that I can be ready," she said.
Political Trump Summit in West Virginia, YouTube Center
Donald Trump will start a series of campaign meetings this night at Wheeling, West Virginia.
You will be the first of five scheduled meetings to be held next week, including standing in areas where many followers are including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to prove that it is still suspended about who has chosen him to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support in the elections because the Zambians are at risk of losing the parliamentary control when votes are voted in November.
How long will the Trump meeting in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
The Trump Summit in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled at 1 p.m. today’s Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump meeting in West Virginia online via a live YouTube channel.
Trump will likely discuss this week's case about the president of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which has caused much concern about sexual violence that led to a temporary halt of the Senate’s vote for a week while the FBI is doing an investigation.
But the goal of the meeting is to draw attention to the national candidates in the November elections to become more popular.
So President Trump's campaign committee said these five conferences in the next week are aiming to strengthen volunteers and supporters as the National Socialist Party tries to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the Council of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Senate control is important to his agenda so the president will travel to as many states as possible as we get closer to the campaign stage," a spokesman for Trump's campaign board who refused to be recognized told Reuters.
As scheduled to be held at Wesbanco in Wheeling, this night's meeting can bring followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media outlet of Pittsburgh," according to the Metro News newspaper of West Virginia.
Saturday will be the second time last month when Trump visited West Virginia, a state that won over 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is back on the poll.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must arrive to try to improve his position in the elections," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: U.S. team shows the best way to fight and maintain trust on Sunday to one person’s game
After three intervals in the same direction, a two - to - two Saturday afternoon game could become the excitement that the Ryder Cup requires
The rhythmic movement of the cheetah is an entirely invented concept of sports but which players believe in truth and more in such competitions
So where will they go faster now?
"They had control of six marks and now they are four, so we take it as a little faster I think," said Jordan Spieth after concluding the day.
Europe has a better place, of course, with four points, remaining twelve to be leveled.
Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel that they have extra energy and a lot to encourage them, as well as the Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each takes pride in three of the fourths.
Spieth has become dangerous from the start of the game to the groove and has taken the lead as a role model.
The loud noise of celebrating increased as his turn continued, bringing the ball into the hole after blowing the ball into the hole and balancing it when he and Thomas were on the ground with two points after two shifts.
His ball blast to the burrow won the match of 15 burrows and received a lot of cheering noise, which shows you that the American team has not died.
"You must really exert yourself and consider your own match," Spieth said.
Now that’s all these players have left to do now.
Eighteen holes await them to show this.
The only players with more marks than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the strange story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange body of furniture from Europe has four of the fourth marks and has now made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't hit the ball more often on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided playing the ball more often on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The quality, and how their strength seems to increase between them and the crowd shows that the players will give the top competition on Sunday and perhaps no other popular players can win for Europe on the day it ends at Le Golf National if it is not Fleetwood or Molinari.
Well, if all will do so at the same time in different burrows.
It is too early to discuss Europe’s conquest, yet.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson faced appropriate terms with Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in the play of two against two, when he created a pair with Alex Noren.
An extra ball and two more balls in the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedish in a condition that was difficult to get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can drive you away in any situation you may be involved.
The two - way game of two against two is exciting to watch closely because of the cooperation of the pair, the advice given, that they do not give and how the strategy can change immediately.
Europe has done better as a team so far and took a big lead toward the last day but this pair against pair has also shown that the American team has a more aggressive way in which some, especially the US, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a good chance on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it won in a pair-spert match and four balls for 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game twice against Tiger Woods who seemed to be overwhelmed by bringing their total mark until now on Le Golf National as four marks.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, which is fighting the shell that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States that seemed to be overwhelmed in the four football balls of the morning, and won a 3-1 series.
The United States issued more opposition in pair matches against paires and won two matches, but they could not eliminate the shortage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to pray with the shell.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four successive marks when he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after the end of a exciting week, became the second pair to win four opening marks from their four matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in a four - ball match, they cooperated well and won Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who had been behind in both matches on Saturday, showed a show of good sport but has now lost 19 out of 29 matches in four football matches and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested on a four - ball match in the morning, returned to association with Henrik Stenson in a pair of matches and lost 2 and 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not get everything, although the day was beautiful, windy in southwestern Paris.
Three times the main conch winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a pattern for Americans on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 a victory against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four - ball match and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup that the team has been able to go back with four points to one person's sport, though Furyk team needs only from a sare to pray with a shell.
After two days in second place, however, the battle to win on Sunday seems to be going away from them.
North Korea says it's impossible to get rid of arms without believing that others will do what they should.
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of restrictions was further undermining trust in the United States and there was no way that the country could eliminate its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should under similar circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Summit that North Korea had taken “good - minded measures” last year, such as stopping nuclear experiments and missiles, breaking up the nuclear experimental center and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see, however, any equal response from the United States," she said.
"Without any belief from the United States, we will have no faith in our national security in such a situation and no way will we get rid of our weapons first without others doing what they should."
While Ri reiterated the North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the "responsibility" strategy by removing nuclear weapons from which North Korea would take a small step, his statement was important because it did not deny the action to remove nuclear weapons on the terms Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting of the current U.S. President and North Korean leader Singapuri on June 12, when Kim promised to work to "remove nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal solution to the 1950-53 Korean war, but the US says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also rejected a call to stop international barriers against North Korea.
"The US asserts" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the pressure rate by using obstacles to force their aim and even protest the "end of war"," Ri said.
"The view that obstacles can not weaken is an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that the ongoing barriers are building mistrust.
"Ri did not mention plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader touched in the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead lit three conferences between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If a member in the issue of eliminating nuclear slump were to be South Korea and not the United States, nuclear disarmament from the Korean peninsula would not be in this predicament."
Ri’s speech, however, was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the move to America’s continent and North Korea rockets would not be avoided after "Wicked President" Trump referred to Kim as a "shooter" intended to implement killing.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened "to do away with" North Korea, praised Kim for her courage in taking steps to disarmament weapons, but said that a huge task should still be done and obstacles should be held until North Korea is removed from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three or five months--it has not been done.
Chinese and Russia say the United Nations Security Council should set up Pyongyang the steps it took.
However, the U.S. Secretary of Foreign Affairs told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council must go on deep and unconquered until we get the complete, final and possible removal of nuclear weapons.”
Together, the Security Council has raised barriers against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to remove funds for nuclear programs and Pyongyang missiles.
Pompeo met Ri after the United Nations General Assembly later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that improvements have been made, but only within hours in North Korea shocked him by "the fate of a criminal."
North Korea promised at a Moon conference this month that it would destroy the bombing station and also nuclear weapons if the United States took "related stop."
She said Kim had told him that the "related action" he wanted was the security security that Trump promised as Singapuri and toward strengthening relationships with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year calls for all first - degree students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the culture of femininity and read for 'all day' with coffee assistance.
“ The professional found students at the university number one, ” she says, “are often unaware of the basic issue of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and an expert at Brigham and Women Hospital, developed the study, which he believes is the first kind of sex in the United States.
.. He was encouraged to create a lesson after giving a talk on how a lack of sleep affects training.
'At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I told these things only now, in my last year?"
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This lesson, first introduced this year, explains the basics of students as to how a good sleep disorder plays a role in academic and sports activities and also improves general performance.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and a medical director at a university, said that the university decided to start the class after learning that the students had suffered a lot of sleep during the week.
This hour - long lesson involves a series of activities.
In one area there is a photo of a bedroom, where students press for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and talk about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by lack of sleep and the importance of the sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how chronic insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, weakness, and cancer.
The study map of college and an aristocratic, then urges participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know the lesson will not change the students's behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know--just as you have the right to know the damage to health when you smoke, 'Profesa Czeisler added.
Prominent culture in the ‘vigilant’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure to the rising students mean sleep deprivation was an ongoing problem.
To make sure that you get sufficient sleep, which has a good quality, you should be the student’s 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind unsatisfactory and makes you hungry at all times.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old student from California who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to create a class, after sharing in one of his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said that class opened his eyes and gave him the ari to create an entire college class.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduates to take a similar course before entering a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider installing a bell during sleep and also a bell at waking up and understanding the effects of the 'blue star' provided by the electrical screens and LED lamps, which could damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga lawabwaga young Gerrards
Rangers again failed in another foreign game when the Dolly Menga scraper was robbed of Steven Gerraard's team that seemed overwhelmed by a loss of 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was intending to win the first foreign victory since the 4-1 victory against St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt’s team caused Gerraard to lose for the second time in 18 games as a manager and leave his team on the back of the Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
The Menga fasted seven minutes before the rest and Rangers never seemed to be balanced.
While Rangers are now descending to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third place and is just behind Hibernian by the contrast of magoli.
And it may be more difficult for Rangers after the Bendera Calum Spence needed medical attention after a head injury by an object thrown from Rangers supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to a team that closed Ayr in the half final Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who got a uniform against Hearts last week and will be impressed by how his well - prepared team dealt with their opponents constantly.
Rangers owned more rubber but Livingston made good use of their position when they obtained a ball.
They had to fast the second minute when the first Menga ball gave him a chance Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s gate but then threw the ball out.
The prosthet from Keaghan Jacobs happened to captain Craig Halkett but his companion in security Alan Lithgow was able to beat it just outside the goal.
Rangers took control but their game seemed only religious but not self - confident when they approached the closing area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should get a sentence 15 minutes after it was hit by Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson told the game to continue even after the Colombian claimed it.
Rangers could strike two bundles in the gol during the first half but Ibrox Liam Kelly's old gatekeeper did not have a lot of trouble with headball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak cut from Ovie Ejaria.
When Livi’s final in 34th minute did not come from a regular sport, no one would deny that they deserved the victory.
Again Rangers were unable to deal with the iron ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher penetrated Scott Robinson, who was firm and struck a ball toward a Menga that touched and shut.
Gerrard made the decision during the intermission and change of Coulibaly and Ryan Kent and had almost paid off when the organ penetrated the ball for Morelos but Kelly ran out of its section and held off the ball.
But Livingston continued to confuse visitors and get them to play their own way, while Lithgow and Halkett played longer ball after game.
Holt's team could add gol in the last minutes but McGregor was firm and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow struck the ball out with the head.
Rangers Glenn Middleton's saver had other charges of penalties during the last hours they faced Jacobs but the refa Thomson ignored the appeal.
Yearly Detail: Discoverer of Geiger Counter
And now the page from our year's “Monday morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and continues to impregnate ... the day later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans” was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, which eventually led to the development of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The scientific basis since then, Geiger Counter became popular in the popular culture too, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: “It’s Counter Geiger’s instrument, which is used to detect light minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these head tools, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted in minerals."
Evans: "Hear, you start shouting now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery bearing his name is living.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system ‘see’ the bad cell
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system ‘see’ bad cells and kill them.
Vaccination teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of the treatment
Techniques include extracting immune cells from patients, altering them in laboratories
Then they can 'see' a protein that is popular in most cancers and then be reemerged.
Vaccination shows the positive effect on patients who have a wide range of cancers.
One woman who was treated by a vaccine, which teaches her immune system to identify a bad cell, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a normal protein for many cancers called HER2, and then replace them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Arson Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings show that we have a more reliable vaccine."
HER2 "is responsible for the growth of several types of saratani," including breast cancer, ovari, lungs and gut and puru, Prof Berzofsky explained.
A similar way to pick up immune cells from patients and "instruct" how to target cancer cells has been employed in treating leukemia.
Kanye West started a Bitter Prosperation of Trump, dressed in a MAGA hat, After Seen on SNL.
It just didn’t go well.
Kanye Kanye West was sent to the studio during the Saturday Night Live after a high show that praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he could ask for office in 2020.
After an exhibition of his third song for the night, called Ghost Town, where he had worn a hat written in Make America the Great, began rebuking the Democrats and promised support for Trump.
"Many times when I talk to a white man he says: "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would leave the United States a long time ago," she said.
The SNL stage began with a short draft of Matt Damon where Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Committee about the charges of sexual violence made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the incident was not announced, West lyrics were posted on social media by clown Chris Rock.
Whether Rock tried to ridicule the West is unknown.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time before entering the stage with regard to his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go there with that hat.'
They wronged me!
And then they said that I am in the state which I have drowned," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a sinking place?" saying that he will wear my hat of a fanatic, because this means you can't tell me what I should do. You want the world to go ahead?
Try love."
His comments left at least twice to be heard from SNL employees who seemed embarrassed, the Variety Centre reported, and a man there reporting on the publication: "The entire video went silent."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former lover Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
To the surprise of the West, he sang I Love it’s song, dressed like Perrier’s water bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published tweets: "To one of the most brave people: ASANTE FOR MOUNITY."
But the host of the talk show Karen Hunter published tweets that the West had just "reported his attitude and that it is a great thing."
"But I choose to GOMAD someone else (by buying his music or dress or supporting his "sanaa") whom I believe he agrees and spreading a belief that is dangerous to my community.
He has freedom.
Even we too," he added.
Before the show, the apparition announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "really known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellowfokaer, Snoop Dogg, has been branded Snoop Lion and no doubt the late prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to a artist known as Prince.

The star of the Game of Kitis Kit Harington rebukes poisonous masculinity
Kit Harington’s famous scooter like Jon Snow in a series of Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31 - year - old actress has rebuked those with a male husbandly ploy, saying that the roles on the screen mean little boys often feel that they should be hard enough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes "there is something that has gone wrong in the area" and questioned how to cope with the problem of toxic maleity in #MeToo's era.
Kit, who recently married a fellow star Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted to feeling ‘multiple’ in handling this issue.
'I feel personally, quite strong, for now--where have we erred on the issue of masculinity?', he said.
'What have we been teaching men as they grow up, according to the issue of our current crisis?'
'Kit believes that TV can be a part of the increase in toxic masculinity from its male participants.
He continued: ‘What is natural and what is taught?
Is that what is taught on television, and in the streets, which makes little boys feel they should be such a man?
I think this is one of the big questions at the time we live — how will we change that?
Because for a certainty things are going away from our young people.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in the preceding episodes with Game of Throne when the series comes to the end of the next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield and the horse.
Beginning in November Kit she will be involved in a film from Sam Shepard True West that is a story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The character recently revealed that meeting with his wife Rose was the best because of her involvement in the Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife in this period, so I found my future family, and my life from there,' she said.
Rose played like Ygritt , the loving interest of the character Jon Snow who played like Kit, in the Emmy Awards series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the Leslie Scotland family property grounds.
VVU/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Over 820,000 people are infected in the country, health authorities say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new events were caused by sex, signaling changes from the past.
Usually, HIV spread rapidly in other parts of China as a result of blood exchange.
But the number of people infected with HIV this way had dropped to the sfuri, the Chinese health leaders said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
., however, year after year the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is a tough issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexual love in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be very high.
In view of the conservative values of the country, research has estimated that 70-90% men in homosexuality eventually kill women.
Many infections result from the use of immunity during sex acts in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised all access to HIV as part of an effort to deal with this issue.
Maxine Waters denies that his worker uncovered the data of GOP managers, rebuked 'dangerous lies' and 'conspirative theories'
U.S. member of parliament Maxine Waters on Saturday refuted claims that his staff published a personal comment of three Republican managers on the Wikipedia pages of the parliamentarians.
Demokrat's MP from Los Angeles said that the charges were being spread by analysts and websites of "the right-hands".
"A lie, lies, and more useless lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The comments are alleged to include home addresses and US fours ’ phone numbers of US Broadcasters Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, by Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
A comment appeared on Thursday, published by an anonymous Capitol Hill at the Senate panel to hear charges of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure took place a short time after the managers shocked Kavanaugh.
Such conservative sites as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that recognizes the source of literature was associated with the Waters office and comments by the Waters worker, Hill reported.
"These unnecessary demands are totally false and thoroughly misleading," the Waters continued.
"My worker--whose identity, personal explanations, and security have been affected by these false claims--never involved in exposing these comments.
These baseless claims are totally false and are totally misleading."
Waters' report was quickly released online, including an old journalist at the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is full of rage," Fleischer wrote.
"This means that he has no control over the right emotion to be the Commissioner of Parliament.
When a person is caught up in a wrong action, he or she should not become angry.
He should not be anxious.
He should not question the motive of the complainer.
She should be calm and unequivocal.
"Fleischer seemed to compare the answers of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats against Justice Kavanaugh, who was taken by critics by an angry appearance during the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate through the Republican party who seeks to remove Waters in the election of representatives, also published his thoughts on Twitter.
"A great thing if it is true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed "right authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false charges.
"We will make sure that those who did this are exposed, "continued," and will be legally responsible for all their actions that damage and risks to everyone and all my workers."
Johnny English film surveys hit again - jokes in Rowan Atkinson's Destruction · Global Voices
It is not unusual to look at the effects of Brexit in any new film based on England but that is not used in another motion of amusing-wars in Johnny English - which began in 2003 by Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the personal joke in the topic of how we are careless will be a new opportunity out of the country?
At any rate, Johnny English observatory, a very sensitive face has a license to make a second set of mistakes--noting its further sign that he is created with a broad humor to non-political people.
He is actually a chief investigator who despite the strange claims for a fascinating catch reflects the qualities of Clouseau, the qualities of Mr Bean and one who contributed to one of the Chariots of Fire’s music at the Olympic opening ceremony in London 2012.
He was initially involved as an international traveler and wonder atkinson at one time involved in the forgotten Barclaycard TV broadcasts, leaving behind many if they were not interested.
There is one or two in this recent film of JE.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter wearing a uniform suit of armor and rafadar rings temporarily changing over his hat.
Atkinson’s release in physical amusing was demonstrated here, but humor seems to be inferior and unnecessary, is being modern because such films as "larger" and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The humor seems to be targeting children and not adults and to share Johnny English's special travels are not creative and don't have the comical humor of Atkinson's silent film as a character Bean.
The current concept is that Britain is in serious trouble.
An online intruder has been able to enter the British Internet and expose the identity of all British detectives outside of work and to surprise the worker at work - unfortunately the task was simple for Kevin Eldon.
In his last time as a proud prince and faced with much opposition and already completely affected in political popularity: Emma Thompson does very well for his character that corresponds to Teresa May but the story does not help him to display these qualities.
His safety counsels to inform him that because the identity of each investigator has been exposed, he must use a retired person.
And that means sending Johnny English himself, now employed as a school teacher in an elegant school, but he teaches informal studies on how to become a secret spy: some good humor there, while the English is teaching a screen similar to the school of Rock film.
The English is sent back to the Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with a former Bough, reenacted by Ben Miller.
Bough now a married man, he is associated with the ship’s commander, a thrilling place where Vicki Pepperdine is not related.
So the characters that match Batman and Robin but by destroying the Kingdom Secret Service return to work and are in harmony with Ophelia Bulletova, who is reenacting as Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister seems more involved in surveillance of a humane who claims to be able to solve all technology problems in the United Kingdom: Jason Volta, who is reenacted by Jake Lacy.
The English and the Bough begin their most exciting journey : making themselves hotel waiters, lighting a French restaurant; starting a riot and entering without permission on the elegant Volta boat; and English causes the kashesheshe as he tries to use improved weather equipment to learn about the Volta boat’s interior.
All breaks are undoubtedly removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the tension and turmoil included, there are too many traits of children's programs in the same film.
Get them right.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I had to think of them again: cann't the British film sector give Rowan Atkinson the responsibility which makes justice for his talent?
The Leba denies that it is organized for the British to work four days but to be paid five days.
The Leba Party headed by Jeremy Corbyn will consider the strict plan that the English will work four days on the hawk - but five days paid.
The party is alleged to require company leaders to pay money saved through fake (AI) intelligence to employees for an extra day.
It will restore workers to grow up with three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said that the idea would 'be good' to the party' economic agenda and to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Centre for Labor Organization as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
The main source of the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: 'Relational surveys are expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It's not going to happen immediately but four days to work are the same as the party's view in balancing the economy for the workers and the general strategy of the party for the sector.'
'Leba's will be the first to recommend such an idea, Green Party promised four days of work a week during his 2017 campaigns for the general election.
Ari hio is now not supported by all in the Leba Party, however.
A spokesman for the Leba Party said: 'four days of work a week is not the party's policy and it is not considered by the party.'
Alternative Chansela John McDonnell used the Leba conference last week to describe his experiences of the economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to remove power from the 'invisible executives' and 'profiters' in services companies.
Chansela's alternative also means that the current marine security agencies will not be able to return all their money because the Leba Government can make a ‘cut’ on recognized grounds.
He also confirmed that plans to install employees at company boards and to create the Shipping Money to provide 10 percent of the private companies, who will have the opportunity to get between £,500 annual distributions.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy explains "soons" if the FBI's investigation against Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI survey in the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment of the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised a question whether the results of the FBI can change the opinion of the Republican generals to support them.
In an interview published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked the Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be clearer than his companion from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the case, I said, I spoke to Justice Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this, when the allegations came up, I said, 'Did you do that?"
He was firm, ariable and accurate."
Graham’s vote, however, seems irreversible.
"I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh and will take a very severe trial," he said.
"Dk. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused strongly, "Graham added, meaning Christine Blasey Ford."
"And everyone involved could not prove.
They are 36 years now.
I see nothing new to change."
What is the World Motivation and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens Scene, a music event that includes a beautiful list of stars singing and the same appealing messages; the end of poverty in the world.
Now in his seventh year, the World Commission will send tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn region of Central Park not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real purpose of ending poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Summit, which said in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group that hopes to end poverty by raising the number of people facing it directly.
To get free ticket of the event (unless you would like to pay the VIP ticket), concert supporters had to complete a series of activities, or "acts" such as volunteering, email to the world leader, phone or any other effort to help increase awareness of the goal of eliminating poverty.
But how has the World Summit been so successful that 12 years have gone by to reach its goal?
Is the idea of selling people to free party tickets a real way to get people to push for action, or just another case known as "only online activism" - people feel they are bringing a genuine difference by signing a petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Summit states that it has hired more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters to different goals.
It says that these actions have pushed world leaders to announce promises and policies corresponding to the equivalent of $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, this group showed 390 promises and ads based on his actions, at least ten billion dollars that have already been distributed or donated.
The team estimates the amount of money available so far as to have affected about 649 million people worldwide directly.
Some important promises include The Power of Nutrition, a team of investors and donors in the United Kingdom aiming to "help children reach their full potential," promising to give 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the World Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, philanthropists, national governments, and Earth's Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of undernourishment just a matter of history," Power Council of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live London concert on April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 operations were completed in requesting Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced charity for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with a good diet.
In answer to questions in the blogosphere and Answers section of her website "do you think that we can end poverty?"
Citizens of the World Prosecution responded: It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we'll fall down and fail.
But as human rights activists and groups against racism before us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars that will sing at the event in New York, which the local people will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy to "prevent" Russian energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can “if it is necessary” to use his Navy to prevent the sale of Russian energy, including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Minister Ryan Zinke has said, as explained by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's participation in Syria - in particular, where it works with a legitimate government invitation - is an excuse for monitoring new energy markets.
"I believe their reason to be in the Middle East is to search for economic markets as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," she reportedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to cope.
"The United Nations has that capacity, along with our Navy, to ensure that the maritime routes have been opened, and, if necessary, preventing them, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants attending the event hosted by the User Energy League, an unprofitable group that says represents "the voice of users of energy" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, saying that they are similar.
"The economic status of Iran and Russia is, according to the use and exchange of oil," he said, referring to Russia as “insufficiently informed” and economicly based on coal oil.
The news comes at a time when Trump's regime has been in a mission to increase its supply of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which has become an expensive choice for European users.
For that reason, Trump's administration leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unfit" Moscow "Nord Stream 2" pipe, which according to Trump, made Berlin a Moscow "slave."
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Nord Stream II's 11 billion pipe, which is aiming to double the current power of 110 billion cubic feet (10 billionth of the volume), is simply an economic project.
The Kremlin says that much of Washington’s opposition to the project is rooted in economic causes and is an example of unjust competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not necessary to make a press and that users should be able to choose sellers," Russia's Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been taken by Germany, which has proved his dedication to the project.
The German sector, the German Industrial Organization (BDI), has required the United Europe’s energy policy and the contracts of two countries between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when the third country interferes with our supply of energy," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) said after a recent congress between Chansela of Germany Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "He Will Look Deeply" for Preservation in 2020, Massachusetts's Senate says
The Massachusetts Senate Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she could "look in detail" as president after the election of representatives.
During a meeting in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It is the time for the women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government and which includes the woman in power," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will look deeply at if I am on presidential."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in a negative direction.
"I'm very worried within me about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been very much concerned about his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet he published on Friday, Warren said "We certainly need to investigate the FBI before vote."
"A survey released on Thursday, however, showed for a large number of voters in the Warren area they don't feel that he should run for 2020.
59% of the voters "able" in Massachusetts said the seneta should not run, according to the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Research University.
Thirty and two percent supported such arguments.
Research showed further support for the demands of the former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent for and 48 percent for the refusal.
Other well-known Democracy names being considered to have the power to run include former President Joe Biden and Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin points to the frustration of Track Palin’s traumatic event at Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he was registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, when he goes back, I can understand other families who are experiencing the effects of traumatic stress and some of the impact our soldiers have on them, "he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin pointed out the step of arresting him as a "distinction" and said that his son and other soldiers, "go back in the opposite direction, return with a strong belief, wonder if there is respect for the community and astronauts and every other military member, for his dedication to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Silla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence to a woman and affected the report of domestic violence and possession of arms when he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Silla Police Department.
18 states, DC supports new immigration policies
Eighteen states and Columbia District are supporting the opposition of the law to the new US policy that refuses refuge for victims who flee from crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a small report of friends-business on Friday in Washington in support of those seeking refuge against policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainer in Grace v. against Sessions was submitted by the United States Civil Freedomal Union that took place in August against the policy of the country has not been exposed.
She said her boyfriend "and her sons of a criminal group," they abused her but U.S. officials refused her call for refuge on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Supportive lawyers explained the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which offer a large number of refuge applicants in the United States, such as countries facing the problems of crime groups and domestic violence.
A new policy of refuge in the United States changed the 2014 decision by an Immigrant Rufaa Boot that allowed unregistered immigrants who flee from domestic violence to be protected.
Columbia Premier General Karl Racine said in a Friday report that a new policy "is ignoring decades of provincial, international law."
"The law of the country needs that all demands for refuge be decided according to fact and specific demands, and the refusal violates the principle," said a friend-buttered statement.
More lawyers said in a report that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the US economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and to “suggest services.”
Chief lawyer Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to take refuge for victims who fled domestic violence and criminal groups in June.
"The refuge is for those who flee their country because of abuse or fear because of race, religion, nation, or socialism or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement about the policy.
The measure of refuge was not intended to solve all the big problems — even problems — that people face all over the world every day.
Extensive efforts to save in Palu as the number of disasters doubled in the race for survivors,
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It seems very bad," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her fever - stricken child at a rescue center in Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Fresh water is not readily available."
"The residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, taking wet equipment, trying to save anything they could get.
Hundreds were injured while hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 - magnitude quake, were unable to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was broken back and shoulder, fell on her outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside for future shakings.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a violent quake shook the room in the fifth floor of the hotel where her wife and daughter were housed.
"There was no time to save.
I was squeezed into the rubble of the walls, I think, "The Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the town for wedding.
"I heard my wife weeping for help, but then he became silent.
I don’t know what happened to him and my child.
I hope you safe."
U.S. Ambassador kills China for 'oppression' through 'propaganda propaganda'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper that illuminated the common benefits of U.S. and Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador in China inspired Beijing to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump Jumatano last referred to the Chinese funding in Des Moines Register - the best-marked magazine in Iowa State - after the boycotting China for the election of U.S. delegates on November 6, the allegations that China has challenged.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US elections shows what U.S. officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in Washington’s fast campaign to pressure China.
While foreign governments are known to install ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in commercial wars that have caused an increase in the level of tribute for individual goods.
Early Chinese revenge was created to affect foreign salesmen from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Trump Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, UChina’s top exporter, said Beijing had a devastating effect on workers, farmers, and businessmen in the United States.
China, Branstad wrote on a comment in Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the abuse by posting propaganda on independent media."
"In spreading his propaganda, the Chinese government is using a method sponsored by the US for freedom of speech and information by posting a billed ads on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the streets of Beijing, you will find very few voices producing opposition and you will not be able to see the reality and different views Chinese people may have about Chinese culture projects, considering that the media are closely controlled by the Communist Society of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China’s most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say what magazine.
Republican Disfellowships Women to Representative Rape With Kavanaugh’s Conflict, Analyst Warn analyst
While many supporters defend a member in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several charges of sexual harassment, critics have warned that they will have serious consequences, especially from women, during the elections of representatives.
The feelings surrounding this have been very high and many of the Citizens openly expressed that they wanted to continue the vote.
Not to be reversed, "Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he is concerned that the final pressure from Senate Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI will be enough to hold voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow and even the entire November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the nation's development group MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington DC.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "Novemba is coming!" as Christine Blasey Ford protested on the main road, when the National Socialist Committee of the Court chose to continue and be elected to Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The temptation and pressure of democratics has exceeded expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
"People say they have already reached a high level; that is true.
But it may be much higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and small voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before the public evidence for Ford told of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court voter, critics said the bad consequences may follow if the people of the Republican will continue and prove.
"This has been a game to GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Citizens, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the last vote or vote whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it's also about the way the Citizens have dealt with this and how they dealt with him," Guy Cecil, director of Preities USA, a group that helps select the Democrats, has said in the news center.
However, Americans seem to have some difference as to who to be trusted after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, while many lean on Kavanaugh.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 percent of the members are open or perhaps believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were clear or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh in detail or perhaps lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian, reported.
Ford witnessed before the Senate Court Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had persecuted him at 17 years of age.
Ramirez says that the Supreme Court Choice revealed his secret parts when they attended the festivals at the school in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
World Wide Web Explorer Plans to Start a New Internet to Compromise Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, launches a new trade that will challenge Facebook, Amazon and Google
The modern program of the ecologist, Inrupt, is a company based on the Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and people who are allowed access to the information.
In a unique interview with the Fast company, Berners-Lee claimed that Inrupt's aim is "rule the world."
"We should do it now," he said about business.
"It's the time of history."
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create a "space data storage" or a POD.
It can include a communication list, a list of things to do, a calendar, a library of music and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Park, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all found on the same website and at the same time.
And special about the online data reserve is that only the user can reach what kind of explanation.
The company refers to it as "personal access by data."
Inrupt's idea, according to executive Director of company John Bruce, is for companies to bring resources, process and accurate knowledge to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now includes Berners-Lee Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the community assigned to create this project and the volunteer community.
Since this week, tech scientists around the world can create their own global applications using tools available on Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that she and her team haven't talked to "Facebook and Google about whether or to start a complete change where all their parables of business will be combined in one night.
"We do not ask their permission."
"On a post at Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's message is to provide commercial energy and environment to help protect justice and the quality of a new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the discussion of having an independent website.
Even during Inrupt’s inauguration, Berners-Lee will remain a member and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I have a wonderful hope about this Internet period," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross Prize - Winner of WWWW1
A special Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross’s prize during the Great War I if a fighter has been celebrated in his town a hundred years later.
Colonel Lutena Shepherd Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in an attack by Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an attacker four days later and never found out that he had won the highest British military award.
The commemorative stone has been revealed by two of its grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it is "a strange example" that the stone is actually revealed 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his squad alongside Canal de Saint-Quentin "through heavy fog and heavy fire from the field and guns."
Later he ran on the shooting line and with "greater courage" he led a line forward before using a stadium gun alone and targeting three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German attacker on October 4, 1918 - more than the month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "acts which I know I can't reach but are very impressive."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown of flowers after a parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Corps.
Michael Vann said "he was very respectful to participate in a parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is shown with support from many people."
MMA fans spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they found Peppa Pig instead,
Think of this, you have waited all night to watch Bellator 206 but only to be denied watching the main event.
The bill from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was blown straight all night in England via Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to serve one another, observers in Britain were left open mouths while the show was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after remaining awake until early hours especially for fighting.
One fan on Twitter described changing and installing children's cartoons as "some type of serious joke."
"It's a government rule where at six o’clock in the morning the content had to change the program for the children," said Dave Schwartz, the president of the markets and communications of Bellator, when asked about the broadcasting."
"" Peppa the pig, "yes."
Bellator Scott Coker's president said that they would be going to work on their future British audience schedule.
"I think when I think about the return, I think we can perhaps consider this," Coker said.
"But now it is at six o'clock Sunday morning there and we can't consider this up to Sunday when we are, Monday when they are.
But we are mindful of it.
I believe that there was a steady flow of messages when it changed.
We were trying to fix, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not, however, a matter of government.
I can promise you that in the future such a thing will not happen.
We will put it in five rather than six struggles - as we do regularly - and we tried to work hard for the fans but failed.
It is an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'hurt' because of her sex
Olympiki diver Tom Daley says that he felt weak because of his sex throughout his growing years - but that gave him a measure of success.
This 24 - year - old said he didn't realize it until he joined high school then "I realized that not everyone is like me."
Speaking on Redio 4 in Desert Island Discs prepared by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about the issue of homosexual rights to give others "hope."
She says that parenthood made her less focus on winning the Olympic games.
Kirsty Young, a long - term producer, has been outdoors because of illness.
Participating as an outcast in Laverne's first period, Daley says he felt more "moved" than everyone his age because it was "not accepted to love girls and boys."
He said: "To-day, those feelings of self-employment and limitations, and feelings different from others are things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
She wanted to prove that she was "something," she said, so that she could not discourage anyone at last when they discover her sex.
Twice a copper medalist believes Olympiki's games has been a prominent member in the LGBT campaign and was used to participate in the Commonwealth games in Australia to urge more countries not to consider the issue of homosexuality as a crime.
He said he appeared because he felt lucky of being able to live without consequences and wanted to give to others "hope."
This three-fourth Bingwa said he loved another man - a U.S. filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "you found him by chance."
Daley married Oscar, an elderly winner for 20 years ago but said that the age gap has never been a big issue.
"When you go through a lot of things in a very young age"--he went to the first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later-- he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had gone through such things.
The couple became parents in June, for a son named Robert Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his views" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I thought 'I need to win a gold medal'," she said.
"You know, there are more things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold altar is Robbie."
"He has a name similar to his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that he didn’t admit that he would die and that one of the last things he asked was if they were still getting their Olympic tickets in London 2012 — because he wanted to be the front row.
"I could not tell him 'you can't go near the same row father'," he said.
"I had held her hand when she stopped breathing and I had to stop breathing and die that I believed she had failed," she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and conquered copper.
"I only knew that this was the one I had dreamed about for the rest of my life - diving in front of the crowd of our people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," she said.
It also encouraged his choice of the first - Proud song sung by Heather Small - that had given him a challenge during the preparations of the Olympics and had caused him to be inconvenient.

Missing Mickelson is put on a bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will keep track on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his sport so as not to reach the same point without fun.
Mickelson, playing twice a year and keeping a record of playing 12 times, was put in a bench by captain Jim Furyk for a four - ball game and a pair game.
Instead of being in the depth of the event, how often he was to the United States, this great - shell winner five times divided his day between being a fan and training in hopes of correcting his problem.
It is never a leader even at the top of his job, the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for the game in the Le Golf National, which bad ball is punished from time to time.
And if the stadium is not a reason enough, Mickelson, at the ninth match on Sunday, is confronted by British champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined a new player Tommy Fleetwood and won four matches this week.
If Americans, who are four trails behind the start of one person’s match of 12, have strong opposition, Mickelson’s match can prove just how important it is.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, greeted me and hugged me and assured me that he would be ready to-morrow," Furyk said.
"He has much courage in his ability.
He is a very popular man and has contributed much to these teams in the past and this week.
Perhaps I could not see him playing two matches.
I expected him to play more, but that is what happened and that is what we thought we should consider.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo’s record with many matches in the Ryder Cup held Sunday.
It may be the last of her in playing Ryder Cup that has never matched her personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 and seven uniforms lost, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's funny, brave, he likes to tease people and is a good person to be with him in the team," he explained.
"I think that shoot players were also happy to fight him too this week, which was interesting to see.
He has more to pay than play."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of many marks can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that great leadership can turn into a tense trip if it enters the last days of the Ryder Cup.
Mdeni played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had five marks against Americans but ended with the game in full swing, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You continue to remind us that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we had a large leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very close," said Bjorn, photographed, after watching the 2018th Class win the 5-3 Friday and yesterday and leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history points to me and everyone on the team that the game is still over.
You’re going to get worse there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you’ve done things the way they should.
The game is not over until you get a mark.
We are aiming to try to win this shell, and that's what we're targeting.
I've said this all the time, I'm looking at the 12 players who are on our team, but we know well how good a team is — the best players in the world.
"Happy at the way his players did in a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I would have no more hope for this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal matter to decide, and that is different.
It’s nice to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you’re out alone, you’ve been fully tested with all your abilities as a golf.
This is the message you need to share with players — to act out your best tomorrow.
Now, you are leaving your associate to go and do the best in his or her own way, as well as in yours.
"In contrast with Bjorn, the captain of the group Jim Furyk will send his players out to be better private than they played like members, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who received three of the fourth marks.
Furyk himself was involved in the famous games on the last day, after being part of the winning Brookline team before the defeat came to an end when Europe found "A Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said, being puzzled about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, brought his players together toward the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get a better start as it was in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When the speed goes the same way, it places a lot of pressure on the central matches.
We organized our players for success and put people in the way we felt we were favoring, you know, we are trying to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to control conflict and to deal with Rory McIlroy at a high match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and the other Ian Poulter on the European team in the upper half of the list.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it lights up the whole trip," said Bjorn to his choice of players in the private game.
A new German warship is postponed again
A new German Navy ship was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace the old ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until the next year because of poor systems and rising costs, the media reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," a ship leading between new Beden-Wuerttemberg ships, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit quoted from a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but the post-relaying issues affected the fate of this huge project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships that Navy ordered in 2007 are coming to replace Bremen's warships.
It is known that they will include power capsules, a series of planes and artillery and vessels as well as coded technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and aerostic signals.
Other important categories include organizations after a long time - it is possible to send the new ships away from home for two years.
However, the ongoing delay implies that the high - ranked warships - that would allow Germany to aim abroad - will already be out - old when they are in use, explained Die Zeit.
F125 became famous last year, when German Navy refused to launch the ship and return it to the Blohm & Voss Square in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the ship’s builders after the delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of reasons for the "necessary applications" that made ships less useful if they were sent to war.
Shortages in the program were important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg is going to be driven by 120 sailors - only half of the workers on former Bremen ships.
It also happened that a ship had an extra weight on it and reduced its activity and put a limit on the ability of Navy to improve it in the future.
The 7,000 - ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship is believed to weigh twice the size of German-like ships in the Great War II.
Apart from faulty frames, the cost of the entire project - including training for workers - is also a big issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion yurus ($3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion yuro.
The difficulties facing a new ship become especially important because of the warning that German navigation has dropped.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary security committee, admitted that Subduing "goes missing ships capable of being sent to war."
The officer said that the issue has long been ignored, since old ships were hauled away but no substitute ships were offered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships would be used by Navy.
The Nationa Trust subverts the bat’s secret life
New research on the Uskot Mountains region aims to describe bats ’ use of the environment in hunting their food.
You expect these results to provide new explanations about the behavior of these unique animals to jump and help regulate future conservation operations.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow the pipistrelles and soprano bats as well as Daubenton bats in Wester Ross’s Inverewe Gardens.
Special recoditions will be set up in important areas near the region to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
Both NHS staff and volunteers will investigate the phone with manual resolutions.
The auditor of the voice of all records will confirm the return of bat sounds and the species that do it.
A map of the environment and reports will be released to create the background of the photographic landscape in their character.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, expects the results to reveal which areas of the environment are most important to bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
These comments will help determine the benefits of such environmental concerns as the creation of pastures and the best ways to sustain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats on Scotland and England has plummeted during the past century.
They are exposed to threats from construction and development that affect the nesting and habitat loss.
Wind taboos and lamps can also be dangerous, along with pesticides and some chemical products of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits are more important than their eyes when they reach is the process of catching prey.
They are using a complex system of local echolocation to target insects and obstacles in their way.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land across the country, takes special attention to bats.
It has provided training for ten trained professionals, who occasionally research, nest inspection, and sometimes bats.
The organization has even established the first and special bat reserve in Scotland at Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson said that it is the best place for the bats.
"Here at Threave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all the beautiful surroundings.
But there is much about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other possessions will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
"He emphasizes the importance of watching bats' presence before making organisations in property because it is possible that in ignorance damage can kill until women and 400 bats, and perhaps destroy all the bat populations in the region.
Bats are protected and illegally kill, harass, or disrupt their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Uskot officer at the Popo Conservation Union, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about our bats because most of our species do not know how many."
Ronaldo refutes the charges of rape while lawyers plan to prosecute a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo says the charges of rape against him are "false stories," saying that people want to "declar themselves" in his name.
His lawyers have arranged to imprison the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker and Juventus have been charged with rape of an American woman , his name Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room at Las Vegas in 2009.
She is alleged to have later paid her $375,000 in silence, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram's live video to his 142 million followers a few hours after the claim, Ronaldo, 33 years old, condemned the report as "false stories."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, the false news, "the winner of Ballon d'Or's awards says on cameras."
"They want to introduce themselves by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be popular by my name, but it is part of the work.
I am happy and am all right," the performer added, smiling.
Ronaldo lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel on the charges, which they said are "unconventional reports of suspicion in a private area," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek a solution to "moral corruption according to the seriousness of abuse, which may be one of the greatest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at the hotel and Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to return to the player’s room, where he was allegedly raped in the back, according to documents presented to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that for "99%" he was a "good" person dropped by "one%."
Manuscripts claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the jwa had sexual overtones, but they were voluntary.
Mayorga also says that she went to report to the police and was photographed of her injuries in the hospital, but later she accepted a ransom from the court because she felt "a fear of revenge" and was concerned about "the public humiliation."
The 34 - year - old woman says she is now ready to regret the ransom because she is still struggling with the experience.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the claim, and this season he moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought with 100 million pounds.
Brexit: Britain 'will never regret' for losing auto manufacturers
Britain 'will never regret' for losing its position as the world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, Secretary of Business Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "awassi" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Europe without a contract, the United Nations would have been able to stop the production period at his factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr. Clark
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of procrastination if there is no treaty after Brexit will lead to unemployment.
Burnaston - a factory that manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year when 90% were exported to the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the European Union in March we will see the stage to stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director general of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some car manufacturers in Britain have expressed fear of leaving the European Union without agreeing on how the border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says to close his small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Key issues are related to what manufacturers say are the risks of dissemination in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is being implemented on the basis of "proper time", and access to materials every 37 minutes from British dealers and the European Union on ordered cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union uncontrollably on March 29, there may be problems with the limit that the sector says could result in delaying access to materials.
Toyota can't wait any longer one day in her Derbyshire factory, said the company, and so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the plan of Theresa May's Checkers of later relations with the European Union is "rightly organized to avoid the investigation in the border."
"We need to have a plan. We want to have a better agreement which will allow not only the immediate success but also the opportunity to take place," she told Today's Radio.
"The witness from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we really need to be able to continue to get the distribution that has been successful before."
Toyota could not say time off production, but for a long time, it warned that extra expenses would reduce industrial competition and eventually unemployment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union in the factory, said its members are increasingly worried: "In my experience after these jobs leave they never return.
The government spokesperson said: "We have established a reliable and accurate plan of our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high school and deputy lawyer Rod Rosenstein can be "traditioned for another week" while the struggle for the highest court-league Brett Kavanaugh went on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of adviser David Mueller, who is studying election intervention with Russia, the connection between Trump and Russia's supporters and the possibility of a restriction of justice with the president.
Whether Trump seeks a job as a vice - lawyer and thus endangers Mueller’s freedom, it has fueled Washington’s rumor for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a cable to record a conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through 25 adjustments.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, allegedly about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations meeting in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said "like" not to cancel Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the Senate Court committee that Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, all testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation in charges against Kavanaugh, and led to the delay of the full vote.
Trump’s secretary, Sarah Sanders, was in Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The time for that is not set, it may be this week, I can see that it's driving back for another week in view of the case in the highest court.
But we will see what happens and inform the media.
"Some journalists could object to this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Aboriginal Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information is not due to a lack of favor on the media of "guide attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they are interested."
He then said that live contact between Trump and journalists will increase.
"Rais do more questions and Answers than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at the statistics."
"The release of information to journalists will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media have the opportunity to ask him direct questions of the U.S. president, it is better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen it do more in the past few weeks and that this will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump occasionally responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he is in open settings or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media outlets are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving an improbable speech and sometimes to appear before the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health writes European Union staff at the Public Health Organization about Brexit's fears
The minister of Health wrote the European Union staff working for Health Organization expressing appreciation for the country and expecting their survival after Brexit.
While remaining six months, Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter to England to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scots government has dedicated itself to the cost of housing applications for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “In summer, conversations between the British and the European Union about withdrawing have continued, towards decisions expected during this season of the fervor.
But the British Crown also enhances its provisions with an improbable solution.
I know this is a very unhappy time for you all.
That is why I wanted to express my appreciation for the contribution of each worker, regardless of their nationality.
Wenzetus from all over the European Union and more, are bringing in valuable experience and knowledge that strengthen and improve the health - care work, and help the sick and the community we serve.
The wallet is really your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie in Emergency Surgery After Head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after receiving a head injury in a 31-27 game on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Tennessee’s vice president Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before a break.
"He came to the edge and flattened it," Reed said.
Medical personnel and doctors gave Abercrombie oxygen from the edge before holding it in the lactate with more precision.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV period in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been completed with surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation of the type/part of pain yet" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first - class student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five confrontations on Saturday before he left the game, which added a total of conflict during the season to 18.
Extraterrestrials will be paid high stamp tribute in England
Buyers from foreign countries will be awarded high stamp taxes in Britain while additional funds are being used to help homeless people under the new Tory plan
The same action aims to counter Corbyn's successful attempt to attract young voters
Increase in stempus tribute will be paid to those who do not pay their tribute in Britain
The Ministry of Finance hopes to earn up to $120 million a year - aid to the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be awarded a high stamp duty in England - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
It will look like an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has had to attract young voters with the promise of offering affordable homes and targeting those who have a higher income.
Increase in stamp taxation will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay their tribute in Britain, while additional funds are being used to improve the government's plan to cope with homelessness.
The extra payment - including the current stamp tribute, including high levels set two years ago in seconds and rented houses - may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes that the same action will give it up to $120 million annually.
An estimated 13 percent of London’s new buildings are purchased by non - British households, resulting in an increase in prices and a challenge for first - class buyers to their first residence.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "middle towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending more time abroad.
A new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp tribute to help the younger ones buy their first house.
He shocked the big construction companies for putting up the prices of property by buying land and not building it and asking Mrs. May break free from renting houses to repair the "obscene sector" of the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an intriguing series in residential evolution, including tax control will call for a "excuseless" eviction.
He also wants to empower the councillors to build a new house.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to restore the British dream--that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our damaged residential sector.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and start a new life.
However, it cannot be fair for people who do not live in England, along with foreign companies, to buy houses at the same cost as the hard laborers in Britain.
For so many people the dream of property has been too far away and there is a great possibility of not having a home."
Jack Ross: 'The end of my determination is to be a spasmot'
Sunderland Jack Ross's manager says his "terrible" is that the Uskot manager at some point.'
This 19-year-old Scottish, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-Masharic club, which is now in third place in Ligi I, three signs from above.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Usoccan League last season.
"I wanted to play with my country as a player.
I was able to get a national game for the B and it was there, "Ross told the BBC Uskoti Sports.
"But I grew up watching the Uskoti in Hampden with my father as a child and was always impressed by it.
However, the opportunity will come only if I succeed in the management of the club."
"Conserations of Ross as the Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic says he had no fear of following such famous names in such a large club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be measured by 'why, can I return the club to the Great League?'
Because of the design and equipment in this club, it should certainly be in the Great League of England," she said.
"It’s not easy to go back, but I'd just think I'd been successful here if I can return the club up."
"Ross has only three years since he started his job as a manager's assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months as a trainer at Hearts club.
Then he helped Alloa from having lowered the bridge to the third one and changed the St Mirren from being lowered to winning the next Ligi cup.
And Ross says he feels much better than he did at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Perhaps it was a real way," he remembered, taking control of Alloa.
"I really believed the administration was good for me, more than play.
It seems strange that I did well, earning a living out of play and enjoying the highest levels of living conditions.
But playing can be a challenge.
There are many things to do every week.
I’m still going through this on the issue of stress and job pressure but feel that management is right.
I always wanted to be an administrator and now I do so, and I feel better inside me throughout my life of being an adult."

The best time for getting alcohol is 11.30 Saturday evening, research has discovered
The heat of summer has increased consumption in hard - pressed British bars but has added to the pressure at restaurants.
Bats got an increase of 2.7 percent in July - but drinking in restaurants dropped to 4.8 percent, statistics showed.
Peter Martin, a business consultant for CGA, which included these figures, said: "The continuation of the sun and more time in the World Cup of England means July followed an example similar to June, when bars got 2.8 percent increase, except that the restaurants had even more effects.
A 1.8 percent reduction in the restaurant business in June went even worse in July.
Bottled glasses improved with coffee bars.
The glass of food was affected in the hot season, though it is not like the coffee riders.
It seems that people just want to go out and get alcohol.
Controlled boots saw a 6.6% increase in sales for the month and diets dropped by three percent."
"Paul Newman, entertainment critic and generosity at RSM said: "These findings continue in a trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social events or sports are still among the greatest threats to domestic sales.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8% drop in sales each year will be devastating in view of rising costs.
The long summer has arrived in the worst time for food providers and we’ll have to wait if the average temperature we got in August will change things for the better."
"The general growth of sales in bars and restaurants, including the new trade, was 2.7 percent in July, compared with the decrease in print products.
Marketing monitors in the Coffer Peach Tracker sector for bars and restaurants collect and criticize data from 47 working groups, with a combined sales total of more than $9 billion and is an important pattern in the sector.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One out of five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, research reveals
Research for 20,000 high school students shows growth on the page “false Insta”
The statement has caused fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said that they own a "great" account to show their parents
One out of five children - some as young as 11 - are creating fake social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the "false Insta" account - reference to Instaram's website sharing photos.
The news has added fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they set up a "great" account to show the parents, while they also own other private property.
A mother who discovered her 13 - year - old daughter's website found a young man urging others to "bake me."
The study of the Digital Awareness UK and the British Association of Maintenant Schools (HMC), found 40 percent of 11 - to 18 - year - olds had two and a half of their accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's worried that many young people are being tested in creating online sites that parents and teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the Synagoth of the Uskoti Athlete
Elidd Doyle has been selected in the Synagogue’s board as a non-active director at the central meeting of the government board.
Doyle is the most successful Uskoti athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described it as a great opportunity for those who take the lead in the sport to benefit from his international experience over the past ten years.
"Elidh is highly respected in Scotland, England and the world athletes community and we're sure it will be very useful to join him in a board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead a game in Scotland."
The United States, who won the 200 - and 400 - meter - foot [200 - 400 m] Olympic Games in Atlanta between its four - Olympic gold total and is now a BBC analyst, was unable to walk after losing a flow of blood.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago I suffered a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that it would only matter in time if I could recover and to what extent.
It has been a real struggle to recover fully, to learn again how to walk and today to make a relapse!
Thank you for the message of comfort!"
A notice of breast-pack comparing mother to cow has made a different comment online.
The breast - pampu company has divided comments online using an ad that compares mothers who are breast - feeding with milked cows.
To mark the inauguration of what is known as “the world’s quietest breast pump wearer,” Elvie’s technology company that released a comedy video video of music to show the freedom the new pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are playing dens in a cattle - stocked cellar with a song including: "Well, I squeeze myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't know this is not my breast."
The song continues: "Choose out, decide outside, I am feeding the children, pull out, pull outside, I milk my women."
However, the ad, published on Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
For 77,000 times in view of hundreds of comments, the video has received a different comment from viewers and many say it reflected the "fears" of the milk sector.
"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
If we need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, unless their babies are removed immediately after we are born, "one wrote.
Elvie’s breast Pampu is getting very well into breast - feeding scavenger (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It’s a nuisance for both mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps to mothers who remain with their children?"
Another man added: "A announcement that doesn't reflect on reality."
Others advocated the announcement and one woman admitted that she felt the song "a joker."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I would have found one if I had still been breast - feeding.
Crying made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is silly but understandable.
This is a creative product of the above conditions, "one wrote.
Another person said: "This is a happy announcement that targets mothers who milk (often in place of work or toilet) and feel like "dombe."
"This is not an ad of praise or shock to the milk sector."
At the end of the video a group of women show that they have all been playing with pumps in their notes.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use pumps say they feel like cows.
The Pampu of Elvie, however, is quite silent, has no cable or tyubu and fits quite into the breast - feeding tray and gives women freedom to move, holding their babies and even going out while milking.
Ana Balarin, an associate and ECD teacher in Mother, said: "Evie's stamp is a revolution that was worth the determination and inspiration.
Considering the link between describing women and milk cows, we wanted to post an act of breast - feeding and all its challenges in observation, while expressing in a way that is amusing and interesting the meaning of the new freedoms that the pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During the Wiki of Fashion in London, a mother of two walked to the platform with architect Marta Jakubowski when using the product.
Hundreds of Courageous Immigrant Children to Tent Camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased even though the number of those passing to the border has not changed, because the strong politics and policies of Trump's regime have made it difficult to keep children in the hands of donors.
Usually, philanthropists have become unregistered immigrants and have been afraid to jeopardize their ability to pray in the country by promoting demand for a child.
The risk increased in June, when the country's authorities announced that possible donors and other adults should submit fingerprints and that the data will share with immigration authority.
Last week, Mathew Albence, a senior immigration and Customs Execution officer, testified before Parliament that the organization had arrested several individuals who had asked to help children who were alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80% of those who are humanitarian or family members are illegal here and most of them are illegal foreigners.
.. so we continue to pursue them, "Mr. Albence said.
In the process of ammunizing children more quickly, leaders introduced new laws that would require some of them to be brought to court within a month of arrest, instead of 60 days, which were previously customary, according to residence workers.
Many will be sent by video through the meeting, instead of being present, to appeal to their case on the legal basis of the immigration judge.
Those who are taken unworthy with help will be brought back to their land quickly.
The long stay of a child’s detention makes it possible for him to experience fear and anxiety or discouragement, which can cause feelings of trauma or attempts to escape, according to residents and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
The lawyers said these issues are rising in large centers like Tornillo, where the sign that a child has bad conditions is ignored, because of his size.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving sufficient time to provide them emotionally or to interact with friends for the last time can add to the enormity that many are already passing through.
Syria tells the 'American forces', France and Turkey, leave immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although it is now eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, also serving as prime minister, said foreign troops are illegally in Syria, under a pretext to fight terrorism and "will be handled accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and without obligation," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism was almost complete" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been thrown away from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in these holy battles until we saved all Syria” from all terrorist groups and “any foreign presence.”
"The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, especially for training and counseling Kurdish and Arab Syrian troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 armies in a war - torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions were good for them to turn back and blamed "the western countries" for "the spreading of false fear" that has caused refugees to stay away.
"We have called on an international community and human agencies to make it possible to return," he said.
"They are putting politics on human affairs."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no construction assistance for Syria until there is political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a league site in Idlib's last fortification has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussion.
The Russian-Uturuc agreement has prevented the attack by the Russian-based Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless insisted that the agreement had a “revelation” and expressed hope that the military action would help the militants as well as the fighters from Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who are "resolved."
United Nations delegate Staffan de Mistura hopes to provide the first new committee conferences that include government members and opposition to provide postwar constitution for Syria and to prepare the election route.
Moualem imposed the policy of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the work of the panel should be controlled "to examine the articles of the current constitution," and to warn against intervention.
Reasons for Trump’s Return to Second Elections
with such logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 elections unless observers are eager for progress and change hope that, for the crime of mismanagement and scandals will end presidentship earlier.
And that would certainly be "the greatest end of presidentship ever!"
At present, there are no signs of fatigue on the part of the viewer.
Since 2014, surveys of major times have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and about three to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" leads to an estimate of the cables for 3.5 million viewers on the main night of the news.
"These are things that attract people because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC dramat "Designed Survivor," regarding the minister who becomes president after the attack to destroy Capitol's prime offices.
Nell Scovell, an old comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And wachache Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
He recalls the ride of a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him that he would vote on Mr. Trump.
He asked.
"He said," because he makes me laugh, "" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is the value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, Washington’s stories may later determine the case of Roe v. against Wade, if migrant families can be reunited with global economies.
Promotion is only the pleasure of viewers with many opportunities that they can afford.
However, the issue exceeds the discerning citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour to watch Paul Manafort's panel ("the proud and heavy dress, "Washington Post) said) and the results of Stormy Daniels' comment about Mr. Trump’s body.
I will never see Super Mario the same way again.
"Perhaps of what he is doing and makes it seem like a real show is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump changing the character and scenery every day (institution to NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You would not want to miss one time or stop pursuing it.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a 50 - degree sun outside her house in northern Kauai, but she was locked in watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not if Brett Kavanaugh nears the Senate Court Committee and the Supreme Court's fate were not known.
"I remember the time when we were doing all these amazing sessions in the past and the people were saying," this was the beginning of the West civilization, "" Mr Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was funny, but it turns that they were right."

Outdoor currency overflows into the closest elections of Parliamentary representatives
No wonder 17 districts of Pennsylvania have experienced a financial flood, thanks to revisiting the parliamentary districts of which the present two leaders fought for the same seat.
The new Pittsburg district has Mwanademokrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in the last special elections of spring.
Lamb is running for another person, Mwanarepublican Keith Rothfus, the current leader representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is widespread with a new 17 new.
The maps were recaptured after the Pennsylvania High Court decided in January that the former districts had been designed to fit the people of the Citizens.
Robo in 17 new countries has initiated financial competitions in the National Campaign Services (NRC), Democracy Parliament Committee (DCCC).
Lamb was a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a special election that was staged in March in the 18th Pennsylvania Parliamentary District.
The chair was held by Mwanarepublican for more than a decade by President Donald Trump won 20 points.
Political experts say the Dominicans have a little better to win.
The U.S. imagined El Salvado’s Reprising for China, and then left it · Global Voices
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already identified Beijing with the slight pressure not to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a fine meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until members released the Trump Administration team.
Officials in the Federal Department decided to remove the U.S. diplomatic general from El Salvado, Dominican Republic and Panama on "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan again," a spokesman for the department, Heather Nauert, said in an earlier report this month.
But the punishment was focused only on El Salvado, which gained $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reduced funding and ultimatums, would have a profound effect on the Central American country and unemployment and high homicide rates.
While local meetings continued, leaders in North and Central America proposed a high level meeting on safety and economic welfare and followed a similar annual meeting that seemed to be a prelude in efforts to prevent migrants to the United States.
But in mid - September, the top administration announced that they wanted the meeting to continue and successfully stop any punishment in El Salvado.
President General Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled to take place in mid- October, with a sign of the importance the regime has set at the convention, the diplomatics said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned undisclosed in El Salvado, Panama and the Dominican Republic without messages or penalties from Washington.
White House spokesperson Mr Bolton refused to report on the debate made by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions without revealing identity.
Not only were their views confirmed by an outside critic next to the regime but they also spoke without disclosing their identity.
A History Survey
The following fall may be the case of lawyer Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's potential to restrict justice, where there is now much evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his study if Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in attacking our elections.
If the Parliament is going to change control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing jurisprudence cases in the parliament, just as he is preparing to revisit votes for voters and perhaps members of his collaborators.
These are many things that are now saying only possible and I don't say that the removal of Mr Trump in the authorities cannot be avoided - neither are such leaders in Europe.
There are choices that must be made on each side of the Atlantic that will affect how long the conflict continues.
In 1938, German officials were willing to revolt against Hitler, only if Western nations refused to support and support Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed out on the years of killing that followed.
The course of history revolves around such changes and the stability of democracy is speeded up or delayed.
Americans are facing several changes at present.
What will we do if Mr. Trump cancels the role of Deputy Addicter Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad situation since the newspaper reported that last year, she recommended secretly recording the president and saying that she was not worthy to be aphisin.
Mr Rosenstein says the Times' memory is inaccurate.
"How can we answer if the FBI's new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete and fair - or whether he is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite charges of sexual violence and false testimony?
And above all, we will be able to vote in the election of Parliamentary representatives who will not make Mr. Trump focus on justice?
If we fail to measure this, democracy will be subject to long - term decline.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi government that once used my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika sign.
With that as my heritage, how can I miss our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is hopeful before a match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers are a native of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory of Austrians, after a good uniform in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a better position to win from G in Europa League.
The knee wound prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first match this season to 2-2 uniform against Villarreal but believes Rangers can use it to start many things.
"It was a good mark for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We entered the game believing we could get something and returned with one sign.
Perhaps we could get more in the end but, in general, the uniform was probably the right result.
They were probably better in the first half and we went in the second half with a better quality.
Entering Thursday, it is another big night in Europe.
We hope, we can get all three marks but you'll be a hard game because they got good results in their last game but, along with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year it was very hard, between everything that happened to my victims and the changes in the club but there's a feeling about the place right now.
It is similar to the sporting world; you exercise it well.
We expect, we can push now, forget the past season and succeed."
Women lose sleep from fear of retirement
While it is true that research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, a few people were talking to their families about this.
Nearly half the people in the survey of the whole country said they were talking to their lovers about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to care for them, but they don't take the initiative to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide insurance.
This is how one begins.
Talking to your boyfriend and children: You cannot provide for your family’s ministry if you do not get your priorities right in time.
Associate with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive the ministry, as such choices can be important in deciding the cost.
Share your financial planner: Your mentor may also be able to help you find ways to pay the bills.
Your long-term philanthropic choices may include long-term insurance policy, the euphemismal policy of living budgets to cover these costs or the independence of your wealth - the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Keep legal cases in advance.
Get a medical representative so that you can select a trusted person to oversee your medical service and make sure that experts comply with your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Consider, too, the lawyer’s contribution to your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and guarantee that your expenses are paid on time.
Do not forget the details: Think of your elderly parent as having a medical emergency and on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicines and allergens?
Keep the details in written order to prove yourself ready.
"Not only the money is involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

State prosecutors are seeking a rare capital punishment for charges of terrorist attacks in New York City
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, accused of terrorist attacks in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state for national crime since 1953.
Fifteen - year - old Saipov is alleged to use the rented Home Depot to make an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Low Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and bicycle riders in his way in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors should prove that Saipov “in intentionally” killed eight victims and “involuntaryly” caused serious physical injuries, according to a death penalty report, released in the Southern District of New York.
All these errors carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a panel of judges issued a 22 trial for Saipov which included eight charges of murder with the aid of fraud, usually used by country prosecutors in organized crimes and charges of chaos and car destruction.
The attack required "to be organized and well prepared," the prosecution said, describing Saipov's actions as "disgusting, cruel and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused hurt, damage, and damage to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York held charges of capital punishment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers but was finally sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The final punishment for death was met in the New York trial in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were sentenced to death after being convicted of conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The two Rosenberg were killed by being put in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of regret the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the researchers that he felt better about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
She also asked to show the ISIS flag in her hospital room, the police said.
He has denied 22 allegations of crime.
David Patton, one of the country’s public advocates for Saipov, said that they were "broken" by the prosecution decision.
"We think the decision to seek capital punishment rather than accept the requests of a life imprisonment without possible release will only add to such events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's representative team previously asked the prosecutors not to seek capital punishment.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be presided over Brexit's speech
Nigel Farage vowed to 'encourage the people' today during the protests at the Tory meeting.
Former Kup leader said politicians should “feel warm” from anti-European citizens - as one of Theresa May member of parliament suggested that she should be the president of a conversation with the European Union.
The Hafidhina member of the party Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain was "to be out" if Mr Farage was to be Secretary of Brexit for the moment.
But the challenge that Mrs. May has to face is the challenge of bringing together its widely divided side as the remaining Tory supporters joined a different protest against Brexit in the town.
The prime minister is endeavoring to implement his initiative checkers as he faces criticism from supporters of Brexit, supporters of Salaa and the European Union.
Its members insisted that he continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite objections - and force the anti-European Union and the Leba party to choose between its plan and 'dissolvement'.
Mr. Bone told theache's meeting in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw away the Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a member and given the responsibility of conversation with Brussels.
'If he had control, we would be ready out now,' he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to forget the checkers plan.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We did not fight in the world wars to pray under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.’
Mr. Bone denied the proposals that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the people of England have changed their minds and want to remain completely false.'
'Tory MP for Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also in the protest and told journalists: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
' Checkers's plan is not popular with the public in general, opposition cannot vote for it, it is not popular for our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us be elected.
Please take off checkers' plan and start listening to people.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: 'The Great Ministers keep their spaces when they keep their promises.'
Mr.Farag told the conference that politicians should be made to “feel warm” if they are about to betray the decision in the 2016 referendum.
'This is about the issue of faithfulness between us--the people--and our political class,' she said.
'They try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we can't let you do it.'
In a message to an excited crowd he added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, to feel hot.
'We encourage an army of people in this country that will give us victory in Brexit and that will never rest until we are free, rely on ourselves, be the British'
Meanwhile, supporters continued march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Many activists displayed posters written against Brexit after the launch of the group at the end of this week.
Leba Senate Mr. Adonis mocked the Haitian security problems they had experienced during the party's program when the meeting was opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have IT and all the technology of the British Scheme and the European Union to respect the laws of another, for the free and open trade in Ayaland,' he added.
'It's an empty lie.
Nothing like a beautiful Brexit," he added.
Warren plans "to look deeply at" to run for presidentship,
U.S. Senate, Elizabeth Warren says she plans to “look closely at the will to run for presidentship” after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that Massachusettsians discussed his fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the World Cup after team instructions give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bettas graduated before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the instructions of the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race.
From the beginning, Bettas got a good start and almost left Hamilton completely while defending her position in the first two circuits and inviting Vettel to attack the other.
Vettel took the lead first and let Hamilton follow a tship on the group’s tail, which should have been very useful.
Mercedes made one circuit and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a fierce contest that led the Ferrari driver to leave the inner area free from the effects of imprisonment after doing so twice in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was in the seventh place for the first circuit on his birthday of 21 years.
Then he took the lead for most of the race and held back and then passed by Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth.
He eventually reached his renovation area in the 14th cycle and failed to accelerate the remaining eight circuits while Raikkonen succeeded.
It’s a hard day because Valtteri did a wonderful work in the entire sails and showed maturity to let me pass.
Timu has done a special task to take first and second place," said Hamilton.
It was the worst language of the body
President Donald Trump taunted Senate Dianne Feinstein at the Saturday meeting on his insistence that he did not uncover a letter from Christine Blasey Ford that accuses a former Supreme Court member Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at the West Virginia conference, the president did not directly discuss the evidence presented by Ford in front of the Senate Court Committee, instead he said that what is happening in the Senate showed that the people were "bad, bad and false."
"One thing that can happen with something good that has been going on a few days ago in Senate, when you see anger, anger and selfishness and lies," he said.
"When you look at the issues and the disclosure and then they say" oh, I didn't do it.
I did not."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you?
You remember his answer ... Did you expose the document--"Oh, what?
Ah not!
I did not reveal it.
"Well, wait a minute.
Is it we've exposed ...No, we didn't expose it, "he added, by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter explaining the charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was exposed early in September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I did not hide the charges of Dr Ford. I did not disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep in secret and kept it secretly as he asked."
But his revelations did not seem well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday night meeting: "I will tell you this, it was a very bad language of the body.
Perhaps he did not, but that is the worst language of the body I have ever seen."
Continuing to defend the office of the Supreme Court, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President proposed that the Democrats were using the charges for their benefit.
"They have decided to take power in any way.
You see selfishness, wickedness, and indifference to whom they hurt, which they have influenced to gain power and control, "The Mayor reported.

Airlines Control Descendants While making sure the Hundreds of Flying Flying Can evade Earthquakes
Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after losing his life as he was seeing to it that hundreds of people were gone safely.
More than 800 people have died and some have died after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Future tremors continue to occur in the area, and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his party’s flight to save their lives, 21 - year - old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to flee to his position in an airport control tower for Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
She prayed to make sure that the Batiki Air Flight 6321, then located on the road, was able to fly safely.
Then he jumped the tfriend’s control tower when he thought that you were falling.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision was able to save hundreds of people, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared helicopters from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the administration fears that the number of deaths could reach thousands and the national disaster organization has said that the reach of Donggala cities, Sigi and Boutong is very small.
"The number is believed to be still on the rise as most bodies were still stuck under the falls and difficult to reach many," said a spokesman for the organization Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The 20 - foot [6 m] waves have destroyed the Palu, which will host a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulance brings bodies.
Fresh water is not readily available.
Small markets have been smashed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is striving to help the victims but we don't know how things are like.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Wido arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all activities related to exile.
You're ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was struck earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
The plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after a plane crash inside the lagoon.
The Pacific runoff airline at Micronesia has now said that one person is not found, having previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members had been saved when the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a report that by Saturday afternoon, it was not possible to know when he was a man.
The agency said that it cooperates with regional guidance, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for explanations about passengers, such as his age or nationality.
Local trucks helped to rescue passengers and other crew members after a plane hit the water while trying to land on the Chuuk Island airport.
The leaders said on Friday that seven had been taken to the hospital.
The agency said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in a stable condition.
The cause of fate and a series of events is still unknown.
The agency and U.S. Naval members all said planes landed on the lagoon just before reaching the route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had crashed into the streets.
U.S. passengers Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that she and others could walk through the waist - deep water through the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He said the flight attendants were terrified and shouted and that he had a slight injury on his head.
U.S. mariners said sailors working to improve the piers almost also helped them to rescue them by airboats to land before the aircraft sank about 100 feet (100 m)
Data from the Air Safety Network shows 111 people have died in crash crashes registered by PNG during the past two decades but none were involved with Air Niugini.
The critic shows the record of events on the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s trial ended on Saturday in a referendum where a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for several hours as a lecturer in a field of psychological analysis.
He showed the jury panel how he used cell phones to link the activities of a 29 - year - old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and a 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, to the night of disaster.
Rowlett said he received regional data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claim, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone had Chambers' when he said he had his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and witnessed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had been telling the truth when he said they were in the Sanford car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Some unintended words are that Tellis said he had known Chambers for just two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show that they had met each other in just a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers ’ death, Tellis dismissed Chambers ’ text messages and communications from his phone.
"He completely wiped him out of his life," said Hale.
Advocacy is scheduled to begin his fast arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the case to be referred to a jury panel later that day.

Another black man?!!
A New York house minister accuses couples of being fired after a "racial" message
A New York housewife accuses a couple of dismissing him on the basis of prejudice after receiving a non-hermet message from a mother who complained that he was "just a black man."
The couple refuse to become racist and to liken the allegations to "crastination."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, expressed his concern after he discovered that a new child’s services provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after arriving for his first working day in 2016.
"HAPANAAAAWOMAN MAN," wrote Mrs. Plasco -Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
After discovering his mistakes, "waswastic" Plasco -Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departing minister, of American ancestral origin, had done a bad job and that he was instead expecting a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid a day’s work and was then sent back to Uber.
Now, Maurice charges the couple with a ransom in terms of dismissal and wants a compensation of $350 a day for six months, for living and working, though without contract.
"I want to show you, look, it doesn't seem like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's prejudice."
The couple have denied that they were prejudiced, saying that stopping Maurice was the right step, fearing that they could no longer trust him after they have offended him.
"My wife had sent her a message that she did not intend'.
He is not racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if it is wrong?
Your baby?
Speak the truth."
Comparing the charges with "tradition," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a child and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Will you go to get such a man?
That's not good to do," the bank investor said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public referendum has shocked the couple on social media, attacking their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s printers feared that readers would be fair with the talking bear, a new letter shows
The daughter of Bond, Karen Jankel, born bone shortly after this book was accepted, said regarding the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of the person who is reading for the first time before being published.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great success."
When he said his father, who worked as a camera minister in BBC before he got the urge to write a book of children from a small toy of a bear, would not have a bad feeling for his being rejected, he added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of the book was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who explains that "the most important member of our family," added that his father enjoyed his success.
"He was a man of few words and was not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was very important to him, it is like having a successful child: you are proud even though it is not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington’s success in such a way.
Though it was his art and imagination, he always praised Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to hang her on the phone.
After learning that his daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad used to call and say that the situation was very bad and was not expected to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad to tell me he would die in the next two minutes and I had to say good - bye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi , I love you very much, my son.
I’ll be with you soon.
I'll have you.
The medication doctors had given him to keep his spirit active was slowly draining up in his system.
He had died a while before this point was just his system stopped working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not cry or scream because I was in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to take courage.
"At last Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, for the moment mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - without they knowing what he was going through.
"No one knew, he said.
"I had bowed my head with tears flowing all the time.
It is hard to explain, but it was when I was on the plane when I felt sorry for Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women mourn the posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones by committing suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting a card on the Welsh bridge with a powerful message and phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from pressure to commit suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, in Lydney, said his son was a high - hopeful chef and an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
Everyone said his smile pleased all the people."
However, he left his job before he died, because he was "a place of darkness."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I’m always worried that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis made a card," enabling people to know that there are people out there who can go and talk to them, even if it is a friend.
Don't keep quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15 - year - old lover, not long after his mother’s death.
She did not say that she feels bad or disturbed by the thought," she said.
"Several days before Christmas we discovered the change in his attitude.
She was very low on Christmas Day - while the children were opening up their gifts she did not want to look at them or communicate with one another."
He said his death brought on them, but they would have to work hard to go on living: "It's putting a hole in the family.
It depresses us.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s fate as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked -- a momentary study, the height of size - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was "falling" because of the confusion of the authenticity.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Ukrainians not want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due to time.
The election of representatives is made just five weeks from now, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Citizens fail a lot, then they will be very weak in their efforts to appoint someone they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George Bush has been calling Maseneta, tempting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr.Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush secretary.
What will happen after the FBI released its report?
There will be votes in the Senate, where 51 Citizens and 49 Democrats work.
It is still not known if Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to break up the uniform and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugees drop under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un gained control seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's coalition ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control on the border between North Korea and China and the high fines charged with human trafficking was a major factor.
Pyongyang has not voiced public opinion.
Many of the North refugees are eventually granted South Korea’s citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the highest border with North Korea and is much easier to cross than the allotment Region (almaarufu DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often return them violently.
The relations between the North and the South - who are still in war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met Pyongyang for a discussion that focused on a discussion on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
The event came after a historic conference in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapoo, when they agreed on broad terms to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Secretary of State Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. restrictions for the lack of development since then.
"Without any belief in the United States, there will be no faith and national security and under such circumstances, no way for us to get rid of nuclear weapons as the first," said Mr Ri in a speech of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "uncontrollable," and says unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Parliamentary Leader Nancy Pelosi has said that the president of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is a "uncontrollable person" and said that he is not in a position to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Forum in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were for a woman that did it, they would say 'never can control herself,'" Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Court Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he had persecuted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During his opening report, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes close to shouting and breathing talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also shocked the Wanademokrat on the committee, citing charges against him as "disgusting and predestined to damage his reputation" organized by the angry freeees that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh’s testimony confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was prejudiced against the Democrats.
"I think he is withdrawing for these words and how he shocked the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelos did not object when asked if he would try to remove his power in Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and if the Democrats were numerous in the Representative Parliament.
"I'll say this - if he doesn't speak the truth to Parliament or the FBI, then he doesn't want to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Court of Appeals of D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that if the Mwanademocrat was worried about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Bei Nafuu Ministry Law or Roe's case against the Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his trial of evidence, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he could reverse some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time of an angry man, prejudiced to go to the court and expect us to say, 'that's not strange,'" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use It.
It is a good assurance of pain, months and years of more rage and cannot remove it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that it's normal, do you?"
He continued," I was greatly helped by a woman who was active somewhere, who said he was also crying when he got angry, but he developed a technique that meant that when he got angry and started to cry, he could tell someone who is talking to him," you might think I was sad because I cried.
I am angry."
He then went on to tell me.
And I thought that it was a good idea."
"Travels are allowed as a way to remove rage because they are not generally understood.
One of my memories I remember very much from my early work, the office that is full of men, where I immediately found myself crying out in indiscreet rage, caught the back of my neck by an older woman who was always a little afraid--who drew me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and you will be happy because you and you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Democrat party from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart found a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Mrs Schroeder, he became so frustrated that there was no reason to think about presidentship.
"It wasn't the right decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"Tayari there were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
There is a man who referred to it as "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time was well advanced, he was back on raising stocks and therefore vowed that he would not enter the race unless he contributed $2 million.
It was the war that he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who contributed about $1,000 to men would give him only $250.
"Do you think that you kill I get a bargain cut?" he wondered.
When he gave his speech to announce that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with gratitude for the people who helped him, confused by a system that made it very difficult to contribute money and target voters instead of delegates and anger from gender discrimination until he was exasperated.
"You would think I had a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroeder remembered about how the media took it.
"You would think the company of Kleenex were my commercial sponsors.
I remember thinking, what will they place on my grave?
"She wept"?"
The potentially beneficial business wars between the United States and China
The first voices in the U.S. and Chinese wars were disturbing, and while the war won’t soon end, the distinction between countries may be long worth Beijing, according to experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year for taxing important Chinese sales including solar, iron, and aluminum panels.
The difference with the most impact started this week with a new tribute affecting $200 billion ($50 billion), resulting in a half of all products coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has been a constant reprisal, saving from five to ten percent in recent times for 60 billion U.S. products.
China has promised to watch the US, and the second largest economy does not seem to be in despair at any time in the near future.
Making Washington a move means you should accept terms, but public acceptance of the US pressure will be a scandal to Xi Jinping, president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, the difficulties of U.S. commercial war can help China for a long time by reducing support between the two countries.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can begin to change the economy in any country and is more dangerous than some previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia at the new US Security Center.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says the Secretary of State
Syria has said that she is ready for the voluntary return to refugees and needs help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, the minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al- Moualem said the situation in that country is getting stronger.
"Today the reality is more stable and safe from the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renovate areas that have been damaged by terrorists in order to restore them.
All conditions are now of voluntary return to refugees in a country where they had to flee because of terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily life and their work.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
The other six million people who live in the country need human help.
Al- Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
But he insisted that they do not want to aid on condition or aid from countries that promoted terrorism.
Europe Conquers the Ryder Paris Cup
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the U.S. team with a final mark of 16.5 against 10.5 on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Denmaki Thomas Bjorn’s captain reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time throughout the race, struck his first ball in a 16th - hole hole 3, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his shifts and became 1 in 4 to 5-0 since the current performance of competition in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 by a star at the bottom of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmaki.
Listed first in the world, Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 and Ian Poulter of England who may have played his final game in the Ryder Cup.
In the eight Ryder Cups, the Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the game with 25.5 marks.
"It's not my usual crying but today I've been wet.
It has been a difficult year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
The key is a team and I am happy to be able to help," said Garcia, filled with feelings after the European victory.
He transfers responsibilities to fellow citizen John Ram who won the American star Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in one man’s play on Sunday.
"I feel a strange pride, over Tiger Woods, I was looking at him as a little," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
A startling figure from one of the highest athletes ever available, after winning 14 crowns and being the second in the wake of Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was overwhelmed by the team to keep the ball in the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top of the race.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the lower game of his squad, "I am proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning when we presented the European team with many challenges.
We fought.
Much respect for Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll get organized again, I'll work with our PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll continue on.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be the captain.
You have to give commendation.
They controlled us."
