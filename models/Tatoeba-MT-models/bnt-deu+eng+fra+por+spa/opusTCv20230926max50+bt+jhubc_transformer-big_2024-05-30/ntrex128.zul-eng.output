Welsh AMs are worried that they'll 'look like a puppy'
They question whether they will respond to some among the AMs with the view that they have changed the way they are called MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This is the result of a change in the Welsh parliamentary system.
All political parties are afraid that this will lead to a mockery.
A member of the Labor AM said they were afraid of the same noise as Twp and Pwp.
For students outside of Wales: According to Welsh u twp means stupid and pwp means garbage.
A member of the Plaid AM said that as a group they were never happy and offered other names to choose from.
A member of the Welsh Conservative said as a group they were willing to accept a name change but noted that the MWP is very close to being called a spore.
According to the Welsh letter W is the same as the letter U in Yorkshire England.
In a statement, the House of Representatives said: "The decision to make this amendment will be a matter of concern to the members of the House of Representatives."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh corporation the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public survey with ideas, which received considerable support for the organization's re-election called the Welsh parliament.
In the matter of calling the AMs the commission has established the WMP and the public opinion has expressed reliance on the MWP.
The MPs have also put their own views on it, but the dispute will be a problem for Elin Jones, who will be in charge of the drafting of the amendments in the coming weeks.
The amendments will include a change in the way the date of the appointment, including the amendments to the amendments and the appointment of the committee.
The AI will have a final word on what will be called when the law is negotiated.
The Macedonians voted in favor of a change in their country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This open vote comes after an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict on the issue of neighboring Greece with its Macedonian province.
Athens has long defended itself from the fact that its top neighbors are not the only country to have a part of their country, and it is still denying Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the name change, said the vote would be ignored.
However, those with the name change counting Prime Minister Zoran Zaev see this as something that must be done to become members of the EU and NATO.
It is the home of the Bells of St. Martins for the hardships faced by the congregations in Harlem.
"Historically, the older people with whom I've been verbally told that there was a church and a place for drying up all the streets," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's not even a report".
He said that the disappearance of debris is understandable.
"People are getting involved in different ways today," he said.
"Functions are no longer useful in places where they meet on a daily basis."
Congregations are very concerned because the money that the leaders earn from the sale of goods to the congregations will not last long and the people will not do as much as they did.
He also said that the church would not be able to provide adequate shelter for those who have been left behind.
The majority of people who buy apartments in these white people's apartments", he continued, "will make the official closure soon because they are less likely to be members of the church".
Both churches were built by white members before Harlem became a city of blacks and became the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and became St Martins after ten years.
The first white congregation was formed in the 1930’s.
A congregation with black members serving in a nearby building took over the building.
St. Martins was taken over by a black community led by Mr. John Howard Johnson, who led a protest against 125th Street traders who were opposed to hiring and promoting black people.
The fire of 1939 left the churchhouse injured, but when members of the Mfu Johnson Congregation made repairs they also began to build the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of David Johnson, was the successor to the Rev. Johnson.
An expert who played the instruments in July said: "The treasure of humanity" and "a symbol of unremoved history".
University of Michigan scientist Tiffany Ng said it was the first time in the world that the metal had been hit by black singer Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
The St. Martin's Church has not closed down your space, said Mr. Merrieather.
A few months ago at St. Martin's, the architect and contractor, some of whom were brought together by the congregation's leaders and others were brought with them.
A non-governmental Vestry has written to the depot team in complaints that they do not want to charge the cost of the contractor and contractor so that they themselves as a Vestry do not engage in the recruitment of those contractors and builders.
Some members of the congregation were crying out for the lack of dinosaurs.
The 13-year-old shark has been injured by a 13-year-old lobster dive in California.
A 13-year-old shark is said to have injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday to hunt California lobsters on the day of opening the lobster hunt.
The incident took place at 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help, and then they hugged him and helped him get him out of the water.
How many times did he have to tell his son that he liked to play with a shark in the back of his head?
You've killed me!
"It's going to be a scarf," Hamilton said as he approached a young man.
"I call everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark inside!' he added.
The boy was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, who spoke at a press conference, had appeared in the area a few weeks ago but they realized it was not a dangerous kind.
Giles said the victim was seriously injured in the chest.
Lawyers have blocked access to the sea from the Ponto beach in Casablad to the death of Mya in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and prepare for safety.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area but most are not identified as dangerous.
Sainsbuty's programs put them in the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury will compete with Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams for its stores that are diverse in the fields of beauty and professional assistants.
As part of their efforts to get into the beauty market that can be promoted to 2.8bn, it is one of the most growing markets since the fashionable and indoor appearances seem to be falling backwards. Large supermarket packages will start in 11 stores across the country and then be shipped across the country if it succeeds.
Good financial support comes after markets are looking for ways to use open spaces to reduce the sale of household goods.
Sainsbury says it will double their products up to 3000 installments for Revlon Essie Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The products already available for your Lorela Maybelline and Burt's bees will get more space and areas with their special ads.
The market will also re-produce face masks so that most of their products will have only plant and fruit as the majority of small consumers want it.
In addition, the cosmetic retailer Fragrance shop will hear the water boom at 2 sainsbury's stores in Croydon for the first time in South London last week and the second at Solly Oak in Birmingham at the end of the year.
Technically shopping and small shopping in nearby stores are the reason why the supermarket has made a great deal of attraction to customers.
Mike Coupe, chairman of Sainsbury's, said they would primarily look at the supermarket department in an effort to fight down Aldi and Lidl statistical scammers and additional services and non-food items.
Sainsbury has put Argos in hundreds of stores and included Habitats that purchased two years ago which has helped boost the purchase of their food and profits.
Past attempts at the rehabilitation of beauty and pharmaceutical markets have been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's also tried to share with Boots in the early 2000s also failed after a dispute over how the pharmaceutical profits would be shared in its markets.
This new approach comes after they sold their 281 stores to Celesio who owns the Lloyds pharmacy in 125m over the past three years.
Lloyds will also help by insuring the comforts of such charities as La Roche Posay and Vichy.
"We've changed the way our portfolios look to please our customers," said business director Paul Mills.
We also have a number of well-trained assistants who are close to advising customers.
"A wide variety of products are designed to withstand all the demands and our shopping areas are putting us in the mood to say that we are now entering all the possibilities to challenge the traditional way of buying."
He hears Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby's death in a <0x24>11 million contract.
This comes after Holly Willoughby resigned from a 11 million-year deal with her health business to focus on her other businesses with Marks and Spencer and TV.

This business, comparable to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, was deemed to double its 11 million shares.
Jones has just gone to some of his restrooms when Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram his departure.
The source says that it was actually one of Holly's most important things.
This was his future that he would keep for years to come.
His resignation left everyone in a state of disrepair.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday until the opening of the store was about to begin.
"In Marlow HQ place goods ready for sale".
Experts believe that the move of the newsman, considered by the British celebrity, could throw away the amount of money that had been put on the clothes and on the roads, which could lead to a delay in the sale.
That would mean the only lasting friendships.
Willoughby is the mother of three children and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016 Truly merged Willoughby with Capp, 52, and collaborated with them as a slalom in March.
The couple were together on holidays and Jones has 40 percent on Baldwin's program.

A deep conversation about ‘after we fell in love’
He has made jokes about the satirical criticism of the media even about his belief in the North Korean leader.
Why did the President of the United States take such a stand?
Trump said he called the "publisher of the paper" in his voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
Kim is still looking forward to meeting with him in Singapore in June as he hailed Trump as an important step in North Korea's Denuclearization.
Denuclearization arrangements, however, have been delayed.
More than three months later in June in Singapore, North Korea's Ri Yong told the U.N. at a Saturday meeting that the North does not see "nothing to combine" with the U.S. in the first attempts to disarm the United States.
On the contrary, you have noticed that the U.S. continues to grow steadily.
Trump has been watching a different story.
"We are working closely with North Korea," he said.
We went to war with North Korea.
Most of the people would die.
We now have a good relationship with them."
He said his efforts to strengthen his relationship with Kim had been successful - ending the bombing tests, as well as helping the victims to return home.
He has also taken a stand against Kim's death.
"It's easy for the official, instead of having 10,000 people outside the courtroom, to have 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing directly to the crowd standing before him.
The Indonesian tsunami and the devastating tsunami on the island, hit 100.
Shortly after the earthquake in Lambok, for example, non-national organizations were told that they were no longer needed.
Even though an increase of 10 percent of Lambok’s population has been altered, no natural disasters have been found.
"In many cases, if not, they have made it clear that they do not need foreign aid, so they are stunned," Ms. Subumbung said.
While helping children build a team that will travel to the Palu area, it is not entirely certain that travelers can do it on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a powerful disaster victim, said the Indonesian government is still investigating Palu's situation to see if I allowed foreign nationals to help him with medical matters.
Due to the continued tolerance of the earth, the world is still not ready to face potential environmental damage.
During the construction of Tsunami shelters in Aceh, they do not see each other on the coast.
The lack of sound to alert others to the Tsunami in Palu, even if it was to do something, is like contributing to the death of the soul.
Over time, walking through the forests of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are a long way off.
A hospital boat set up in Lambok to help the crew during the quake in Palu, but will last for three days.
President Yoko Widodo made reforms to become the backbone of his electoral campaign, spending a lot of money on roads and railway construction.
Mr. Joko and his organization are ready for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is facing a difficult situation in Indonesia, where many Muslims will find it difficult to change their minds.
More than 10,000 people have been evacuated from their homes as Christians and Muslims to fight on the streets.

People want to see and hear what they have heard.
Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in the early stages of helping those who have seen and heard at John's graveyard in Birkenhead.

The statue of Cromwell's parliament became a memorial to the latter.
This has caused many of the inhabitants of England to be disturbed by customs and superstitions.
Cromwell, however, described Mr Crick's view as silly and wanted to rewrite history.
John Godsmith, a representative of the Cromwell Society, said: "It's amazing to hear about the removal of an image from outside parliament.
The soldiers did not receive a message from Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell could have been a good dreamer to Thomas of earlier times.
Sir William Hmao, who was a Cromwell champion in the 19th century who also held the team, believes that remembering him could be a good thing.
Mr. Goldsmith told the telegraph this week "Cromwell is highly praised by the majority, perhaps more than anything in the history of his recollection.
No matter where history is, there are conflicts.
In the 17th century it has changed the nation and Cromwell has emerged as a representative who can divide and rebuild our country's civilization.
The results he received as king of defence should also be remembered.
He even killed a Chinese farmer.
The farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the Southwest China market, according to media reports.
The man, whose name was Yuan, was found dead, full of blood in the Liupanshui market in the Guizhou suburb of southern China on Sunday.

"My cousin's leg was bloody," said his cousin, saying his motto was "WU," said the evening news in Guiyang.

An hour later, his body was found.
The animal that killed the man was no place for Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told the media that the pig had been detained to prevent harm to anyone, while the police seized the evidence.
Yuan's family and market officials are discussing preparing for the funeral of the deceased.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported previously.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound-pound pig attacked Welsh farmer’s tractor until his wife threatened the animal.

Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa will be desperate if we head to the cool waters off the coast of Mexico.
Rose is going to come.
Rosa has a wind speed of 85 mph, per hurricane, starting at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go to the North on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the ark begins to change the situation in the Pacific Ocean and travels eastward to the west of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the island of Baja California on Monday the storm will begin to stabilize the humidity of the North-West Territories in the U.S.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Therefore, in the following days the humidity will meet the ark and build strong and widespread rainfall in the Western regions.
Locally, rainfall of up to 4 inches will cause devastating flooding, debris, and even desert landslides.
The tropical humidity will make the rainfall level two to three inches per hour accurately, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall levels can be between two and four inches in the Southwest, mostly in Arizona.
Devastating floods are accompanied by a rapidly depleting state due to the natural dispersion of the humid rain.
It would be foolish to start a business that is actually sick because the rain is coming.
Heavy rains can cause floods to form rivers that appear to have formed years earlier, causing a thunderstorm in nearby areas that will be accompanied by dust.
The upcoming dolphins will bring heavy rainfall to areas close to Southern California and the coast.
Half an inch of rain can cause less damage to dirt and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some scattered rains will begin to approach Arizona in the afternoons on Sunday and early Monday mornings, before rainfall in the afternoon on Mondays and Tuesdays.
There will be rainfall in four rooms on Tuesdays to Wednesdays.
In October we will see temperatures in the U.S. as the Arctic will be cooler, but the Tropics will be hotter.
This often leads to changes in temperatures in a short period of time.
There is a good example of an alarming change in temperatures in central U.S. locations on a weekly basis.
There are 20-degree differences in the temperature range in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat will continue to rise again.

More than 20 million people are watching Brett Kavanaugh's case.
More than 20 million people watched the testimony of the electorate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexually abusing her in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the moment, politics has continued, and broadcast despite being interrupted on their regular schedules due to unforeseen changes on Friday at the last minute: an agreement made by Arizona Sen.u Jeff Flake of the FBI will begin an investigation into the charges.
Ford told the judge that he was very sure that Kavanaugh tried to sneak up on him and take his clothes out of the high level during a gathering at their school.
Kavanaugh, who testified in court, is also fully convinced that nothing happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched them.
The report came from a company that hosted viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figure out some prices that were not immediately available on the channels that spread the greed of PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is often confronted with the challenge of calculating the number of viewers in their offices.
In order to show us how they feel, the number of people who say they are the same as those who watch a football game or who have not attended the tournaments.
Fox News Channel, which has a visionary director Kavanaugh, has led to an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day of the trial, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The curiosity continues to rise after the trial.
Flake was the most anticipated on Friday's drama.
After a statement on Kavanaugh's side of the election, he has been arrested by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday in the morning as a crowd was announced while trying to climb up a fee that would bring him before a judge.
As he sat down on the TV screen, he looked down for a moment.
"I'm in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think you're telling the truth?
He was told, "You're strong if most women don't."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the rent was closed, that he had a lot to say before the court.
Using the cable channels has spread the case, when it is time for the judge to vote for Kavanaugh's release.
But Flake said he would only do that if he understood that the FBI is looking at all sides of the matter next week, which is already seeking a democratic republic.
Flake has changed the mind of his friend while speaking with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons or with parliament, Flake has taken a decision.
Flake's decision was strong, because according to the citizens he did not vote for Kavanaugh without the conclusion of the investigation.
President Trump has also opened an investigation into the FBI to find a counter-argument against Kavanaugh.

Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a report in which police clashed, as a result.
The group has started violently throwing rocks and dry paint, in the thick clouds of flesh.
In the afternoon, there was an explosion of violence by the police who used torches to crack down on the fighting.
After hours, there was a group shouting "no peace and no forgetting" directly to the authorities and saying, "live forever in Spain."
Fourteen people have been taken care of after protests, according to the local paper.
The situation worsens in the region as the year after October has enjoyed the separation of the Catalans.
Voters have voted independently, but that did not agree with the votes at the time of counting.

"We enjoyed it last year.
"I saw my parents crying because they were able to vote, but we were still standing," he said.

Joan Puig, 42, recorded at the time of a dispute over a cell phone, saying that this disagreement was the cause of the damage.
"It's going to be tough," he said.

Menga's win over Livingston by 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Mega's first win over Livingston
Livingston's newly promoted Ranger Steven Gerrard was surprised that he received his second defeat after 18 games as Ibrox team coach.
Menga's score was different as Gary Holt's team rose to equal, the hibernian fell asleep in the second.
Gerrard's team won the tournament in the Premiership in the semifinals and they will meet with Hearts at the top, leaving them with eight points on Saturday.
Before that, the Rangers accepted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League for the fourth time.
Livingston has not yet lost in the 6 games, as coach Holt has continued to be unsuccessful since closing Kenny Miller's vacancy last month.
Livingston has a chance to catch up with tourists.
Holt's team needs to be very advanced before they can work, their understanding has caused a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson had a chance but failed to hit a deal, while Allan Lithgow shot Craig Halkett scratched his head.
The family was busy letting the Ranger play in front of them, because they knew that they could suffer with the set piece.
And that was the way that the big bang came out.
The Rangers made a free-kick for Livingston and found the opening bat, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined Menga, touched the ball and put the score in the middle of the box.
At the time, the Rangers were holding the game but it didn't pass because the players were behind and Liam Kelly was independent.
The match went on for the second round, or Alfredo Moralose who tried to get Kelly to break the ball.
Scott Pitmtman has been banned from Rangers' feet Allan McGregor and Lithgow has left the ball in another game for Livingston.
The crosses came in succession to the Livingston box but the door was cleared, there were charges of trying the pent-up – after which Halkett played badly for Glenn Middleton, and rotted the empty-handed- everything was scrapped.
‘Good’ by Livingston- The Reformer
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game and the results in Livingston.
As a person, they play well, they continue to exceed the expectations as they continue to climb.
Their style of play and their actuality has not changed since they returned from the league, but we should commend Holt for the way he cooked the team to support his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, his strong wall, while Menga retained Conn or Goldon and Joe Worroll through the entire game.
The squirrels were stunned, but they did.
Although they did well under Gerrard, they died to maintain those standards.

Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers after the riots
Six of the prisoners have been injured in bringing them to the men's most suspected prison, the prison's office said.
The chaos is from HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on 09;30 BST on Sunday and is still going on.
The "Tornado" jailed technician was led to face disruption, which includes eight detainees and is carried out on one wing.
The prisoner was slightly injured at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: "Except special trains have been fired to assist in the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six people were injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we want to make it clear that those of my colleagues are being handed over to the police and spent a long time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has arrested more than 500 inmates, accounting for the country's dangerous gloves.
It was reported that the prisoner was being treated after the attack.

Hurricane Rosa hits Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and floods (Weathered areas will be devastating)
It is not uncommon for a hurricane to hit Arizona, but what will happen at the beginning of next week as Hurricane Rosa's power continues to approach the desert in the southwest, bringing the risks of flooding.
Astronomers have already issued a warning to monitor flooding in West Arizona on Monday and Tuesday to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, counting cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is waiting for her to take a trip over Phoenix on Tuesday, coming on Monday with rain.
The astrologers in Phoenix said in a tweet: "Only ten tornadoes have ended up being a metropolitan within 200 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina(1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ track".
The National Hurricane Center estimates 2 to 4 centimeters in density, accompanied by 6 centimeters in the Mogollan Rim in Arizona.
In some desert areas of the Southwest counting the Rockies and the Great Basin waiting for 1 to 2 centimeters, they can be consumed by up to 4 centimeters if possible.
In the face of such dangers of pride, Rosa may be a blessing as part of a drought-stricken attack.
Even though the floods are very dangerous, one of the rains will be a reward because in the Southwest it is hit by a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor (see systems), 40 percent of Arizona's affected by drought, which is the second largest on the list, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will pass before the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still has a hurricane power on Sunday morning as she travels at speeds of 85 kilometers per hour, 385 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and rises north at speeds of 12 kilometers per hour.
A storm approaches the calm waters of the Pacific and therefore expects to drop.
Thus, we are expected to cross over Mexico in a tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday.
Rainfall in a number of areas in Mexico can be severe, it can cause flooding.
Rainfall ranges from 3 to 6 cm Baja California is in the northwest of Sonara, with a maximum of 10 cm," the weather.com reported.
Rosa will be climbing north overseas as a storm before she reaches the Arizona highway in the morning hours of the storm, will rise through Arizona and enter southern Utah at night on Tuesday.
"The biggest potential risks that Rosa could have caused or leave heavy rains in Baja California, north-west Sonara, and the U.S. Wilderness Southwest," said the National Hurricane Cente.
The rainfall is expected to produce flooding that flows with the soul and particles that flow into the centers and highlands of the mountains.
Midsomer Attack: Four people have been arrested for attempted murder

A young boy was found representing the site of Excelsior Terrac in Midsomer Norton, at their 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He rushed to the hospital when he was in good condition.
The 17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-olds were arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Police are asking if anyone can have a movie on their cell phones to see what's going on.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘suffers, cruel, hateful’ Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh votes to reject the painful and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered, angered" by the Democratic Party throughout his promotion process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, in opposition to the corruption from Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a child.
Ford also testified against his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people's quality and courage" of Kavanaugh was on that day.
"The vote to ensure that Justice Kavanaugh votes to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a lot of public service history," he told a crowd in West Virginia.
President Kavanaugh's resignation as he spoke about the importance of the Republican arrival in the midterm elections.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
"I'm not running, I'm running," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere fighting for the position of honest leaders".
Trump denies that the Democrats are in a position of opposition and ban".
The first major motion in the Senate's bid for Kavanaugh's promotion is expected to take place by Friday, with the GOP's top support told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in earthquakes, tsunami, and tsunami
At least 384 people have died, many have been swept away by massive waves while hitting buses, while an earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, officials said.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to 18-foot-high waves were attacked on the shore at nine o’clock, killing many in their deaths and destroying anything along the way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of about six feet [7.5 m].
"When the tsunami threat broke out on Thursday, people were doing their jobs on the coast and did not rush and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's spokesman, said in an attack on BNPB.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it crashed into cars, logs, houses, and hit everything on the ground," Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was passing the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the ground.
Some people climb to the trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
Some 17,700 people were transferred to 24 hospitals in Palu.
Photographs taken by the disaster center showed many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that collapsed and collapsed along with a watered-out mill.
The quake continued to shake the coastal city all Saturday.
The Earthquake series was known for an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) says the power statement released by the magnitude quake on Friday was 200 percent of the atom's energy that landed on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which sits at the end of a long, small half, is likely to increase the size of the tsunami, they say.
Nugroho described damages such as "big" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Members of the victims were found trapped under a drum of buildings that were destroyed, he said, killing 540 people and killing 29.
Nugroho said those injured and damage could be greater than 300 kilometers north of Palu, a place called Donggala, located near the quake's epicenter.
"We don't know how to communicate with people who don't know anything," said Donggala.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers go to the affected areas.
He said, "It's a lot worse than that, but it's still going strong."
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not stating that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the water had arrived at the time of the warning was issued.
A video shared in social media by a man at the base of a building may sound absurdly warning about a tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, the water wall of the sea, which removes buildings and vehicles.
Reuters were unable to confirm the video's authenticity immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami have caused an electrical outage and contact in Palu that has made it difficult for managers to direct relief efforts.
Soldiers have already begun shipping goods from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but survivors need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu resorts on Sunday.
Indonesia's tsunami toll rises to more than 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala have settled in a safe place in Palu, where workers live in shelters built in their office yard, they deliver drugs along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as relief teams began to explode to start aid equipment, some complained that in-depth foreign workers had been barred from leaving Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, goods and workers from overseas may begin to infect if a disaster site is called a national disaster site.
That is not possible.
"It's still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, Speaker of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we may allow foreign aid but it is not yet done."
As the two night falls in Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the survivors hoped that their loved ones would be a miracle to celebrate natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was released from the hospital.
On Sunday, the nurses released a woman who had been trapped under a rubber for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian disabled trainer, has coached two disability losers at the Asian Games, which were merged earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those detained at the Roa Roa hotel, said Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an elder in the field of the disabled, I have compassion for my load," she says.
Mr. Gendon explained that, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel laughing in the middle of the paragliding community, he had sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu race, which became part of the beach party.
His messages, however, cause a single gray mark, rather than looking at the blue strings.
"I think that means that messages are not sent," he said.

The West has changed its name.
Kanye West has changed its name to Ye.
In a statement posted on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "You're known as Just One."
West, 41, was nicknamed For a time and used the moniker as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday night, when he is expected to start his new album Yandhi.
Ariana Grande has placed singer Ariana Grande on the show who has cancelled "for reasons relating to her soul," the founder of the show said.
As an abbreviation of his current technological name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier in the year, referring to his album title and radio The Big Boy.
"I am you, I am you.
It came from Kanye, which means that he is alone, to Him alone - just a reflection of the good, the bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more than just an indication of who we are.
He is one of the most famous writers to change his name.
Sean Combs has been primarily known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he likes to be popular with the titles Love and Brother Love.
The former member of the West, Jay-Z, has done so or without conferences and titles.
Mexico’s AMLO refuses to use war against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the military against civilians as the country approaches 50 years of bloodshed against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Plaza Plaza that "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
Police were fired on a peaceful demonstration on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time when the movement of leftist students was concentrated throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly services to those who study and open multiple public universities for free.
He says that unemployment and lack of opportunities for learning attract young people to crime scenes.
The U.S. should increase support for A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., the U.S. should double the number of researches it uses in the field, said investor and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments from behind the various sides of the U.S. government have made an announcement in the AI, just as the U.S. general has no organized AI strategy.
During that time, China launched its own program last year: aiming to launch .1 in AI by 2030.
"The AI research budget will be a good start, just as all other countries are very far behind the U.S., and we want the next success for the AI," Lee said.
Opposition to financial support could double the likelihood of AI's biggest achievement in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Managing Director of Sinovation Ventures, which he invested in one of the most prestigious AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI's newly discovered American actor Othello, and later became the manager of Microsoft Research and President of China's Google branch.
Lee agreed to former U.S. technology competition as the Higher Education Department of the Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, in order to help see the next industries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to win government grants, says Lee.
"It's not China that removes educational leaders; it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have used lights from universities to work on AI in later years.
Lee said that changes in the immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be provided automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's Council for the Advancement of Intelligence and Intelligence has issued the Next Generation Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The China National Natural Science Foundation has donated money to people from learning institutions such as how the Nationla Science Foundation and others contribute money to researchers, but the quality of academic work is limited in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year. Defence Department launched the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must include the faculty and academics, and the White House has announced the formation of a special committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced <0x24>2 billion in a program called AI Next.
The NSF has invested more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation to build the National Security Commission with Artificial Intelligence has not yet been implemented.
The people of Macedonia voted whether to change the country's name or not.
Macedonians voted on Sunday to have the country's name changed to "Republic of North Macedonia," an uprising that will resolve a dispute with the Greek country that is now blocking the integrity of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, continues to say that their neighbors on the north side of their route are seeking their place and seeking entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments signed an agreement with a noted word, but some say that changing the word means ignoring the customs of the majority of the Macedonians and the Slavic people.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote and the protests make it doubtful that 50<0x25> of the people will arrive until the vote is officially accepted.
A question on the ballot paper reads: "It agrees with NATO's membership with the EU through Greece's agreement."
Agreeing to the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, says it's what you're paying now to recognize institutions such as the EU and NATO in Macedonia, some countries that have been spawned by the spread of Yugoslavia.
"I came yesterday to vote for our country, so that the young people of Macedonia will live well under the umbrella of the European Union because it describes our entire lives," Olivera Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
In the absence of legislation, the majority of members of parliament have said that the vote will be accepted.
The change will require two-thirds of the participants to attend the meeting.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of inconsistencies at 1 p.m.
However, it was still at 16 per cent, with 34 per cent of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, while 66 per cent of the voters cast their votes.
"I have come out to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, city voter, Skopje.
Macedonian PM leader Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia by changing the name of the country that will open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a scene and sat in front of the seats set by those who would resist the referendum.
"We can be NATO with the EU, but we want to join and set up heads, not through the service department," said Kavadarkov.
"We're a poor country, but we're poor.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment in Macedonia, with an average of over 20<0x25> of the unemployed.
"I believe that 80 percent of our citizens will mourn with the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said "yes" the results of "the guarantee of our future."
The goal poll was published in Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research that between 30 and 43 percent of voters to participate – under the expectations.
Another poll, owned by Macedonia's Telma TV, received 57<0x25> of respondents who planned to vote on Sunday.
70<0x25> of the votes say yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the candidates will be 50<0x25> with a single vote.
A failure of the referendum will present a major pro-Western government problem that lasted a long time in May.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through the wall of all Brighton's obstructors
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crashed down Brighton's wall in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy on his 65-minute score.
The Argentine striker was thrown into the stomach at the start of the planning process.
He's in the middle of the three Brighton defenders, before crossing the court.
Aguero is surrounded by four green bars.
Ask one of the intruders before passing through a pile of Brighton boxes.
Then she turned to look at Sterling.
The forward Englishman touched and the ball in the box to return it to Aguero, who used his right-hand bat to defeat Brighton defender Mathew Ryan with a point on the left of the net.
"Aguero is still facing problems at his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told the media.
"We talked to him about playing for 55 minutes, or 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
"We're lucky to be able to get the ball in that position for a while."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues a chance at the start of the Premiere League match.
The oil comes out in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in the middle of Brighton's game.
He sent a beautiful ball in his left hand to Leroy Sane.
Sane said he would touch it before heading to Sterling's side.
The Sky Blues defenders touched the ball into the net and almost went out.

Scherzer wants to play in the spoiler facing. Also Rockies
The National Team has been knocked out of the playoffs race, there was no reason to force another start.
But Scherzer, who is always looking for a challenge, hopes he could enter the court on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, this could end if the Rockies face problems in the playoffs, winning one game by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West and the NL.
The Rockies still hold one wild-card spot by winning 5-2 when they were already facing the Nationals on Friday of the day, but are still looking to catch their first-team first-class cricket.
"Even if we don't play, we're sure that if we get to Denver's level of fans there and the other team will be playing at the highest level this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play there?"
The Nationals are not yet publishers to play on Sunday, but it sounds like they can let Scherzer get into the tournament.
Scherzer, who may have entered the 34th, had a bullpen lock on Thursday and will be dropping his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed striker has 2.53 ERA and 220 strikeouts for 2/3 innings in the season.
The Trump Administration in West Virginia
The president has extended his speech to the surrounding situation in which Brett Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court when he stressed the importance of the Republican nomination to internal elections and leadership.
"We've done everything in November.
It's five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
"This is one of the biggest, very - I'm not running but you can say I'm running and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for the champions," he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrendous, frightening group of non-compliant Democrats, that's what you see right now.
And they are willing to return to power in any way they can, just look at violence and uncleanness.
They don't care who harms them, and who is responsible for them to gain power, that's what they want to have control and power, that's what we can't give them."
The Democrats, according to him, are in a campaign of "rebellion and disruption."
"And when you look at the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "uncircumcised, cruel, unclean and untrue."
She then referred to the Legal Committee of the Senate calling Sen. Dianne Feinstein a Democrat, who drew water from a canal to the masses.
"Do you remember your answer?"
Did you get rid of the document?
Hehe, hehe, me.
"No, no, I've never seen anyone so rich - I've never heard of him before."
The working class is no longer a congregation of any one.
They no longer speak in their minds.
When Momentum’s supporters in my party voted to silence me, I was not surprised at all.
But, of course, I've come back to the MPs of the Labour Party who were told they were not welcome - simply because of the comments on our minds.
His colleague, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment due to opposition to the Semitics.
In my case, however, those who wanted me to be silenced criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the sense of the importance of a thought-provoking financial system, in national security, in Europe, and in other surprises Jeremy has already made a deal with other leaders in the past.
In a statement to the Nottingham East Workers Group on Friday, he said "we want the meetings to be fair and beneficial."
For the past eight years, I have been a member of the GC's board of directors.
Unfortunately today, it is not as modern as conventions and the political promise of "feeling and gentle" has long since forgotten if, indeed, it ever existed.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are no longer allowed on the Labour Party and that opinions are judged on whether they are acceptable to the group leaders.
This began soon after Jeremy became a leader, and my colleagues who said we had the same political views have also been looking for me to turn around and take sides that I would not agree with - whether in national security or in the EU's isolated market.
Whenever I speak to the public - it's no longer important what I say - a wave of harassment on social networks will come up and say that I'm banished, it's destroying politics that I don't have to be in the Labour Party.
And I am not the only one in this situation.
Of course, I know I'm more fortunate than my colleagues because the talks about me are still politically oriented.
I'm amazed that my colleagues are still holding on to the workplace and their determination to remain unconvinced in spite of sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the most disturbing things in this political era is how the levels of abuse have become more unusual.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week the Labor Party had to set a boundary tradition.
The fact is that we are no longer part of this great church and have no confidence in either the change in the rules of voting for the club is becoming less and less.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years and I've been urged to slow down, not talk too much and it'll be "ready."
But I'm not involved in politics.
Since joining Labour for the past 32 years as a student, I was outraged by the Thatcher government for leaving the damaged shovels, I wanted to bring the best public services to those in need – either as a local government or as a government minister.
I have never been involved in politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East in any way can be puzzled about the law of the position of the mummy and the areas of debate about the current leadership.
For those who have promoted the trip on Friday, all I can say is that when the country moves on to Brexit that will be frustrating for homeowners, businesses and our public service, I don't want to waste my time and energy on the Labour Party leader.
Indeed, but the same message I have is popular at Nottingham Momentum, for the dissidents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am self-serving and I promise that there will be no threat or political restraint that will prevent me from doing what I believe will be best for all of you.
Leslie is a MP for Nottingham East.
Ayr is 38-17 Melrose: Ayr has never been defeated
The last two trys have reduced the final results, but Ayr is undoubtedly eligible to be praised for this modern game which has been the best of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're on the top, which is on the side of the 10 who can't be defeated.
In the end, their defense, whenever the opportunities allow, which put the family and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be happy.
He said: "We've been tested all our games so far, and we've never won, so I have to be happy."
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Thanks to Ayr, they took advantage of every opportunity beyond us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt was scored by Frazier Climo, who put Ayr ahead, but, Socland's Rory Hughes got a yellow card, was released from the game Warriors, resulting in Melrose's self-imposed and Jason Baggot tied all the trys.
Climo baronegele Ayr was the best with a pencil, just before, in the first round, put a solo try to make 17-5 on Ayr by a break.
But Melrose in the second round started well and Patrick Anderson's try, scored by Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then there was a catch of time due to serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, he was driven out by a frame, when they moved out and Ayr vigorously moved on with Stafford McDowall's try, insulated by Climo.
Ayr's captain was then given a yellow card, and, again, Melrose owes a lot to Bruce Colvine's try, ultimately strong.
The homeowners returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow ribbon after chasing Climo with the ball, outside the pencil line, MacPherson touched down the remaining Ayr.
Climo has installed, as he did at the beginning, after Kyle Rowe meets with a kicked ball for David Armstrong which sends David Armstrong to the local side in the fifth try.

'The sea is ours': Bolivia's authorities hope the court will open the way to the Pacific
The pilots of the rigging-clad capital and vault in La Paz.
The skyscrapers raise the flag of the blue sea.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have this slogan: "The sea is our right.
Humility is our job.
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastline was lost in Chile in the 19th century and the source is still clear – as he longs to go to the Pacific Ocean again.
Those hopes are probably beyond your years, Bolivia expects to be ruled by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years.
"Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and submission, and is actually looking forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, the official spokesman for Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch the CJ ruling on large screens all over the world, with the great hope that the Hague court will hear Bolivia's complaint that – after years of talks – Chile is forced to negotiate over giving Bolivia control of the sea.
Evo Morales, the eligible president of Bolivia – facing a long-running election – and next year – has a lot to stay with on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is less likely to harvest Bolivia - and that name will change if it agrees.
The U.N. government has the power to impose sanctions on the Chilean government, but it has already decided the outcome of the talks.
That the ICJ ruling came only six months after the dispute was heard that the matter was "not difficult," said Chile's international law firm, Paz Zárate.
In the past four years, it may have been a long-standing success.
"The issue of sea use has been entered unauthorized by the Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morales's speech that promotes violence disrupts cooperation in Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will for a while continue negotiations, but it will be very difficult to continue negotiations after this.
The two countries have not changed with each other since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, has dismissed allegations that the court is too quick to make a decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era of ties with Chile" and "a 139-year period of inconsistencies in the interests of the two countries," he said.
Caldidilla also denies that Morales – who is one of the most famous presidents of Latin America – used maritime affairs as a political basis.
"Bolivia will never abandon its warning to use the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"The decision is an opportunity to show that we need to win the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it is able to trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not stop nuclear weapons first unless they rely on Washington.
On Saturday, he spoke at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow through on its promises at a conference held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments came to a point in time for America. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be in danger of starting a nuclear unresolved issue three months after Singapore and Kim Jon Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's an unrealistic dream that the continued decline of the U.S. to a cease-fire agreement in Korea has all caused North Korea to bow down.
Washington warns that Pyongyang will not be able to carry out the proclamations before it starts to destroy its weapons.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are in need of a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is willing to give up weapons that the world may consider to be the only way to be safe.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion showcases a lot of headdressing that comes in the clothing stores near you.
If you want to expand your list of clothing or just completely block the sun, you can no longer look away.
Valentino and Thom Browne painted a list of major headwear brands on their SS19 album in Paris Fashion Week.
This year's festivals are full of tourist attractions, and there are a lot of tourist attractions.
Valentino’s highlight was a long-sleeved leather jacket with a feathered feather and a skull in charge of the head of the cupbearer.
Some of the great sizes include jewelry, a wizard’s hat.
Thom Browne has revealed unusual facial masks during the Halloween season.
Much of the mask in the mouth looks more like Hannibal Lecter than it looks like it's made up of the main loomers.
Another structure that resembles underwater skirts has a respirator and a mirror.
If you continue with a less popular fashion, you can put yourself in a good mood.
Style viewers observe that large hats may be on their way to major shopping malls.
The giant hat soon followed the 'La Bomba', a double-footed hat that could be opened in this sunscreen, appearing in Rihanna's "everyone" to Emily Ratajkowski.
A basic religious symbol of an unbelievable hat that is popular on social media has sent some goods to the show--a marine bag about the size of a swimming suit of a model.
An orange bag made of raphia tree, wrapped in purple, dressed in white leather on a wrap, was a private visit to the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 fashion show in Paris.
Famous wearer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL ‘I’m looking forward to seeing large hats and marine bags arrive at supermarkets this summer – as loggers have played a big part in it, it’s going to be hard to deny the need to do more things on the scale.’
John Edwards: Agriculture is essential for the people of the continent.
Private schools in Scotland store data on positive results, and this has continued in 2018 with other positive test results, guaranteed only to the individual's successes in sports, arts, music, and other public efforts.
With the unfortunate number of students in Scotland, these colleges represent the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing high-level assistance.
Private schools aim to prepare students for entry to the highest level of education, in the field they choose and in the area where they are citizens of the country.
As a department of education you can plan and start a special education program, we see modern languages continue to become a popular and popular language as a preferred course in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a man in the language he hears, what you say goes directly to his head."
When you talk to him in his language, what you say goes to your heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we will not always rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people of other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that lumber is the most advanced in performance in private schools.
Eighty-eight students who have studied foreign languages have received a Higher Class A.
The indicators, collected from SCIS' 74 schools, show that seventy-two percent of students received Higher Class A in Mandarin, with seventy-two percent of students studying in German, sixty-nine percent studying in German, and seventy-nine percent learning in German.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills for children, young people who will no doubt need them in the future.
The language is now a subject of choice, considered to be similar to the main subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools in the curriculum and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons employers are unable to shut down seventeen per cent of the space (17 per cent) were caused by a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills will play an important role in preparing young people for work opportunities.
With so many prospective jobs that save languages, these skills are vital in a united world.
As long as someone takes what field, when they learn the second field, they put themselves in a better position in their future to have skills like this one.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad puts a person who speaks many languages ahead of his competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, seventeen percent (75 percent) were not able to speak fluent foreign language and have good communication and French is the only growing population with two percentage numbers, 15 percent.
This is why education is important for today's children.
Having many languages that you know, especially those in developing countries, will help to train children for better opportunities to get a better job.
In Scotland, school and school differ in the language they teach.
Most schools focus on teaching mainly older and modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK in terms of this year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child likes, there are many types of lemons you can choose from in private schools, educating specialists in this area.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing an educational environment that will prepare children and educate the children for the skills they need to succeed, this time in the future.
It is unambiguous now, for businesses around the world that the lemons will continue to play an important role in the future of the country, so this mele is reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be included in the "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity, and expertise to young people in Scotland.
You have to do well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Lebron will play his first game in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
It's about time for fans waiting to see Lebron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Trainer Luke Walkon has announced that James will play a weekly game in preparation for the start of the season, playing with the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes they will play will still be short.
"It will be more than one in less than twenty-eight," Walton said on the Lakers' page.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell reported on Twitter that James is more likely to play for short minutes.
After training this week, James is then asked about his plan with the Lakers for six games he has played before the season starts.
"I don't need to play a game of self-discipline from the start of the season at my level in my field to be ready to start playing," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time racing game is shown on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a night drive race in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump's first five races are scheduled for next week, including standings in friendly locations numbered by Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote guaranteed to close the high court vacancy, Trump intends to build supporters in the central election as Republicans are at risk of losing power on Monday.
When will Trump's election take place in West Virginia?
Trump's election race in Wheeling, West Virginia will begin at 7 p.m.. ET night, Saturday, 29 May 2018.
You can watch the Trump election race in West Virginia by entering YouTube to see what's happening now.
Trump is likely to lead this week's lawsuit against the Supreme Court's nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who has been charged with sexual offences by an anti-Senate official as the FBI is yet to investigate.
But the purpose of the campaign is to help Republicans get excited about the elections this month.
President Trump said in his campaign that the next week's five car races are aimed at "given enthusiasm for volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the number of supporters they have in parliament," according to Reuters.
"Presidency control is essential to the president's plan to visit the many countries he can visit as we are stuck in the busy time of the campaign," Trump's spokesman denied that Reuters had denied his name.
Organized for the Wesbanco Arena at Wheeling, modern car racing can bring fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania to the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be the second time in two months that Trump has visited West Virginia, the country he won by more than 20 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help candidates to enter the West Virginia Republican Senate.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president comes to try to let him win the election," said Simon Haeder, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, according to a Reuters report.
The Ryder 2018 U.S. team hopes to fight and keep the hopes in the one-day games on Sunday.
After a three-party meeting, on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup was likely to be repeated four times.
A full-fledged weapon is a game developed but the players don't believe in it, which can't be compared.
So, what are they going to do now?
"They're leading by six points and now they're up, so we're going on as if with a little force I think about," said Jordan Spieth as he drives a bit a day.
Europe has, in fact, four points ahead of twenty-two.
Americans, as Spieth said, have little fun and much to be encouraged by, not in the manner of Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and each got three-four points.
Spieth has always been dangerous and leads by example.
Those who watched were very happy when he was, patiently beating the golf ball is essential for the game to be equal when he and Thomas differed in two.
His golf team won 15 games in the same excitement, this type suggests he believes the American team has not yet come out.
"You really have to be very careful and take care of yourself," said Spieth.
It is now one of the remaining players.
There are 18 holes to mark.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who were asked in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odds, but the competition is very strong and willing.
"Moliwood" is not the only math that will start the bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they avoid bogeys on Saturdays mornings, Fridays in the afternoons and Fridays in the mornings.
This is running, in the same way that both of the noisy players from this noisy crowd conclude that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will no longer be known players who will be more enthusiastic about winning the European as the sun beats the National Golf instead of Fleetwood or Molinari.
The holes are different.
Europe's popularity hasn't changed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, the heroes of morning fourballs, when he was imprisoned by Alex Noren.
Bogey and the two main pairs left a long gap in Spain and Sweden that they would not find.
On Sunday, no one will be able to help you out.
Fourballs and foursomes enjoy watching closely because of the collaboration between the mathematics, the advice they give, the insensitive advice and how a strategy can change quickly.
Europe played well as a team and took the lead at the end but the foursomes showed that the U.S. Party still had the power to continue, selecting Stateside, was skeptical.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be at the top of the best Ryder Cup on the last day after the departure of four balls and foursomes on Saturdays 10-6 leading the United States.
Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won twice as hard as Tiger Woods scored four points for the National Golf Championship.
On the European side Thomas Bjorn, determined to play the cup that they lost in Hazeltine over the last two years, America's failure in the morning four balls, put a 3-1 series.
The U.S. has tightened the foursomes, winning two games, but they will not be able to beat the bat.
Jim Furyk, on the other hand, needs nine points in 12 games on Sunday to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to score four consecutive points while he and Molinari called him "Molliwood" after a good weekend of the club's winning four points in their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls after which they beat Woods and American Bryson Dechambeau in 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who has entered two of the semi-finals, showed great determination but he now lost 19 of the 29 games in a row and foursomes in a row.
Justin Rose, set in the morning's fourballs, rejoined Henrik Stenson in the foursomes in 2<0x26>1 defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third rounds around the world.
And they are willing to return to power in any way they can, just look at violence and uncleanness.
Jordan Spieth and Justini have beaten the Americans three times on Saturday.
They gained 2<0x26>1 by defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the quarter-finals and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4 <0x26> 3 in the foursomes while scratching two opening holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup it is only twice to have a team from four points to single-player games, on the other hand Furyk needs to match only to defend the cup.
After doing it better for two days, or otherwise, Sunday’s attack seems to overwhelm them.
North Korea says it will ‘not’ be armed without a trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that it would continue to deepen its disloyalty to the United States and that it would be impossible for the country to release nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body of the General Assembly that North Korea had made a "reconciliation" last year, such as nuclear deterrence and probe of missiles, elimination of nuclear sites, and promises not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said: "We don't see any response from the U.S.."
"Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no hope for security in the world and under this situation there is no way for us to dismantle ourselves first."
While it disagrees with North Korea's refusal to accept Washington's "classic" nuclear disarmament while North Korea may be praised for taking action, the statement proves that we do not prevent the total elimination of nuclear weapons as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri refers to a statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump meeting for the first time between the U.S. president and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work on the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" during Trump's promise of North Korea's security.
North Korea has always wanted to end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has ordered Pyongyang to release nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"The U.S. persists with the "extinction of the first planet" and raises levels of law enforcement to carry out its purpose by force, and also denies the "declaration of an end to war"," Ri said.
Understanding that the law can bring down the dream of people who don't care about us.
The problem, though, is that progress has deepened our self-confidence.
Ri has not revealed plans for a reunion between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader has revealed in the United Nations from the week.
At least three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If part of the U.S. nuclear program was in South Korea and not the U.S., the end of the Korean peninsula would not result in this commitment."
Even so, the sound of Ri's speech was quite different from that of last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that the U.S. main site with North Korea's rockets took place after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" in this regard.
This year, the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely eliminate" North Korea, boasted Kim's bravery not to take action with arms, but there is still much to be done and the law remains in place until North Korea ends nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for everything, saying "if it takes two, three, or five years – it's okay."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council has secured Pyongyang's approval.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council must be strong and unsuccessful until we see the end, in full, and the evidence of the end."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea's violation of the law since 2006 establishing the payment of nuclear and ballistic missiles by Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri and the U.N. General Assembly and said after all that they had come to visit and Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second.
Pompeo had previously visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He left Pyongyang in July, which made progress, with North Korea only publicly calling him "just a criminal."
North Korea is planning a meeting with the Moon this month to end the position of the missile and nuclear arsenal if the United States takes similar measures.
Kim said he told me about "the same steps" he wanted to strengthen security when Trump promised to stay in Singapore and create a normal state of relations with Washington.
Harvard's students get enough sleep.
The new course at Harvard University this year all the inexperienced sleep a lot to overcome the habit of eating with caffeine ‘all night.’
Many colleges have found that students at the top universities are of no value when it comes to the basics that they can take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, established the course, which is the first of this type in the US.
She was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk about how sleep affects me in reading.
‘At the end of it, the girl came to me and said: ‘Why am I being told this now, in my middle age?’
She said no one ever told her about sleeping - which surprised me," she told Telegram.
The course was first released this year, explaining to students the importance of enough sleep habits to help the campus and exercise, and also improves the daily well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services, said the university decided to die in the course after finding that most students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study includes a series of activities.
The first part is a picture of the school room, where students choose coffee sessions, chairs, coaches and books about the effects of caffeine and light exercises help sleep, as well as sleep patterns.
On the other hand, participants are told that prolonged sleep avoidance increases the risk of heart disease, syndrome, diarrhea, and cancer.
The compass map, with its useful features, will then encourage those who have a share in encouraging them to reflect on their daily routine.
We ‘know that it will not change the behavior of the students’ soon.
We believe that they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing to smoke cigarettes,’ added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'social to-morrow' is something that is being done, meaning, adding that modern technology and excessive pressure on students reduce the level of sleep that is becoming increasingly difficult.
To make sure that you sleep well enough, it should be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, saying—even avoiding obesity, as sleep puts the focus on starvation, which leads to hunger.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design a study, which he studied in one of his classes last year while studying his first year at Harvard.
She said the study opened her eyes and encouraged her to dream of the study to become the center.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask high school students to study in the same way as this study program before joining a competitor center.
Professor Czeisler recommends that readers should consider setting up alarms while going to bed, as well as that they will wake up nin, and understand the negative effects of the ‘blue light was blue' emanating from electrical screens and LED light, which can take you out of the circumference, which leads to a decent level.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's article reduces Gerrard's men
The Rangers were knocked down by the referee and were gone while being picked up by Dolly Menga who attacked Steven Gerrard's unified trial and knocked him down 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox side even aims to record their first-ever win since winning on February 4-1 at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team is the result of Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager who has left his case behind by eight points to the leaders of the Hedbrookes Premiership.
The game lasted seven minutes before the game, but the players weren't ready for the game.
While the Rangers are now down in sixth place, Livingston kicks in third place and behind the Hibernian varies by point vo.
And there may be a problem that comes up with the Rangers after Calum Spence is lined up for the first aid after a nail accident caused by something turned off.
Gerrard made eight changes to the previous Ayr side to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, has accompanied that same Word 11 that reached a point in the Hearts last week and would like to enjoy the way your well-dressed clothes have stifled his fans on every side.
The Rangers may be the most catchy footballer, but Livingston has done a lot with the ball he's got.
It would have been a two-minute draw while Menga's sleepover sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's point but the gastrointestinal player lost a huge chance to gamble the ball.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick got Craig Halkettoy a skipper but his partner Alan Lithgow kicked off the back.
The Rangers were able to manage but it was much more confident than believing in their game in the third final of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt like he should have earned a penalty for the brothers when he was in a match against Steve Lawless but with impetuous Steven Thomson cancelled a Colombian bid.
The Rangers were able to score two points in the first half directly against the pole but Ibrox's older Liam Kelly was unconcerned about the loss of Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's downed attack.
While Livi's opening may not have been in the 34th round of the match, no one could deny that they were fit for their performance.
The Rangers also failed to resist Jacobs's football purge.
Scott Arfield didn't do anything while Declan Gallagher hugged Scott Robinson, who had cooled us and threw Menga to the finish.
Gerrardube's move after a break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change almost immediately became involved as the striker headed for Morelos but the impressive Kelly jumped from his line to stop.
But Livingston went on to describe the spectators by playing their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett scoring long balls behind the other.
Holt's side could have opened a gap in the lead in the finals but McCregor stood out and banned Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball head-on.
Rangers midfielder Glenn Middleton finds a long-term deal when he competes with Jacobs but also Thomson is on the sidelines.
Almanac: Geiger Counter
And now our page of "The Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and BALA ... the day on which the morning physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was developed that led to the device that was eventually built just for the Geiger Counter.
Since then, Geiger Counter has become the backbone of the pop culture, as in the 1950 movies "Bells of Coronado," in which scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
The man asked, "Is that it?"
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, is used to obtain radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you enter the open earphones, you can hear the atoms released by the radioactivity of the mineral."
Evans: "They're out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But this invention will bear his name forever.
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘see’ the wrong cells
A new cancer goal can teach the immune system to ‘see’ the wrong cells and kill them
The goal teaches the immune system to ‘see’ the wrong cells as a treatment system
The process involves taking the cells of the immune system to the patient, changing the laboratory
They "recognize" a common protein in most cancers and are re-injected
The diagnosis shows promising results for patients with types of cancer.
A targeted woman, who teaches the immune system to see the wrong cells, saw breast cancer disappear within 18 months.
This method involves taking protective cells in a patient, converted into a laboratory to "see" a common protein in multiple cancers called HER2, and then rejoined cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "promotes the development of types of cancer," including obstructive, uterine, lung and other cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to take protective cells to patients is to teach them how to understand cancer cells that work well for the treatment of certain types of leukaemia.
Just as West was in the idea of supporting Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance with a sleeve.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was promoted to the studio on Saturday Night Live after singing in praise of U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he will enter the 2020 election.
After singing his third night's song, called Ghost Town while wearing a cap inscribed Make America Great, he was beginning to make a sound with Democrats and confirmed Trump's support.
"I often talk to a white man and ask him, 'How can you love Trump?'
If I had been worried about racism, I would have gone to America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the program with a segment of Matt Damon's where Hollywood celebrity laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on sexual assault charges against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the West Soundtrack was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if the West is trying to discredit the West.
In fact, West complained to viewers that they had treated him harshly in the back of the staircase and put him in the head.
"They put me in the back of the line.
"Don't go to that place," they say.
They threatened me!
"I'm still in a state of emergency," he said, according to the Washington Post.
West went on to say: "Do you want to see a place for the jokes?" and said "can you wear his superman cape, because that means you won't tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try to find love."
Noting the two-time creation of the SNL's shy recording audience, Variety reported, alone telling the publishers: "The studio was silent."
West was inducted into the trust of singer Ariana Grande, her ex-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, who died a few days ago.
West odide many with the song I love it, Dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West is represented by former TPUSA team head Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "With an incredible brave spirit: WE THANK YOU FOR MULANE <0x26> MILANE."
But Karen Hunter, a spokesman for the program, wrote on Twitter that West had "a person who has always been and just that's good."
"But I have chosen not to hire a person (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") which I believe is both supportive and full of a dangerous concept to society.
You are free.
That's how we do it," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be named after "the old Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's partner, Snoop Dogg was once named Snoop Lion as well as the late rapper Prince, changed his name to Prince.
Murder in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was hanged in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The suspect is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Prosecutors will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has criticised male culture.
Kit Harington is well-known for his sword-drawn Jon Snow swinging spot in the creation of a violent classic of HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old criticised the heroic culture, saying that such sites on the screen say that young boys must be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes there is something going wrong and asked how to deal with the bad masculinity tradition in the <0x23>Nami charts too.
Kit, who recently got married to his partner in Game of Thrones, Leslie, also 31, admits that he too is " committed" to coping with the problem.
"I feel very, very, very upset, even now—life is going to be gone in this man's way?" he said.
"What did we learn as we grew older, from the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television can have a slight impact on a bad masculinity culture because of the tough characters.
He continued, "What's natural and what's taught?
What was taught on TV, and on the streets, made young boys certain of this man’s case?
I think the same big problem at this point – are we changing that much?
For there is something clearly wrong with young men."
In the negotiations he has also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones while the game goes toward the end of summer, saying he's already finished with horse racing.
Starting in November Kit will play in Sam Shepard's True West theme filmmaker and his brother, a burglar.
The actor has just revealed that he thinks his wife Rose will be the best thing ever to come out of Game of Thrones.
‘I met my wife in the same game, so I gave the family tomorrow, my life is lost now,’ he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the Love of Kit Character Jon Snow, in the award-winning Emmy fantasy series.
The couple got married in April 2018 at Leslie's home stadium in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14<0x25> progress in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have arrived.
Most of the new cases are sexually transmitted, subject to changes from the past.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials said at a Yunnan regional summit.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS has risen to 100,000.
HIV/AIDS is now a minor problem in the LGBT community.
Sexual harassment in China was abolished in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals is widespread.
Studies have shown that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women.
Most of the infections that come from self-defense are wrong in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged land access to waste as efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that some other work has hampered GOP senators' knowledge, exploding 'dangerous lies' or 'subjects'
In the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has filed allegations that one of his employees has posted information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on Wikipedia's official website.
The Los Angeles Democrats said the allegations have been upheld by the operator of "the right wing" and websites.
"False, false, and many other horrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The hypnotized information includes home addresses and U.S. Sens numbers. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both in Utah.
Information came online on Thursday, filed with an anonymous person at Capitol Hill while listening to the Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh.
The attack came after Kavanaugh was interviewed by three senators.
Ancient sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address indicates that the Waters office is related to it and that it is the best source of information for Waters' work, reports Hill.
"These allegations are false and they are not true," Waters continued.
"The right of my employees – ownership, personal information, and security of those at risk as a result of fraud and false accusations – did not engage in the piracy of the information.
These accusations are false, and they are not true."
Waters' statement quickly became an online criticism, including the old White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's not easy to get tired," Fleischer wrote.
This means that he doesn't have the courage to be a member of the team.
If someone is accused of something they have not done, they should not be discouraged.
They should not refuse.
They should not blame the defendant's motives.
They need to be calm and calm."
Fleischer's response to Waters is a criticism of Democrat Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of critics who were too tired during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican who will step into Waters' shoes in the mid-term election, has also breathed his mind on Twitter.
"It's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said his office had called "the relevant authorities and the legislative body on these allegations of fraud."
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," he continued, "and will be held responsible for all their acts of vandalism that are harmful to any or all of my employees."
View of Johnny English Strikes Again – Reduce the power of the spy poof of Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to look at the importance of Brexit in any British film and does not seem to convey the revival of the Johnny English comedy – which began long ago in 2003 with Johnny English and its restoration in 2011 the Johnny English Reborn.
Eat hot potatoes as we say in the title that we can have a new opportunity to sell out?
At any rate, the open eye, the rubber face of Johnny English who had the authority to promote innovations a second time – that is a big joke designed for the cinemas of non-English-speaking people.
He is indeed an agent of a shrewd detective that even surpasses his extraordinary scam to the glory of revealing the Clouseau, which he attributes to Mr Bean and his influence from the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
And it's from a traveler and a mysterious man named Atkinson who passes through the current ads on Barclaycard TV, who has left the chaos in his wake.
There are two more times in the current tour.
I like Johnny English to ride a helicopter and wear an old suit of soldiers and small swords hanging from his helmet.
Atkinson's humorous gift is a show, but humor seems to be low and extremely exaggerated, especially in the product of "deep" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself now offers comics as an ingredient.
The jokes seem to be higher than the children than the adults, and for me the Johnny English tour isn't stylish and exciting and focuses on Atkinson's noisy film added to Bean's sounds and personality.
It is now the same story that Great Britain is in a large sink.
The cyber-hacker entered a secret British spy network, revealing information of British agents in the industry, which bothered the agency set up in the workplace – which is a little work for Kevin Eldon.
The last moment in the prime minister's self-inflicted and sluggish prime minister, facing a failure in the political community: Emma Thompson tries his best to imitate Teresa-May but there's nothing in the text about it.
His investigators informed him that every spy had been turned over, he would have to find a pensioner.
This means that Johnny English himself, now as a schoolmaster in an expensive area, but offers unrecorded studies on the nature of the spy: the jokes are these, as the English offers spy doctrine at the Rock-type academy.
Anglishushuh was moved to Whitehall to receive emergency orders and be joined by Bough's partner, also played by Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, combined with a submarine commander, a beautiful scene played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who are really in bed at the Queen's Secret Service, are back, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
There, the prime minister is quick to blame for the millions of civilizations that he says he can solve computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough embarked on an intriguing journey: disguised as a tata, they set fire to a restaurant in France; they began a problem smuggling themselves on a beautiful Volta boat; and the English that took away the puzzle while learning to use Virtual Reality headset to wreak havoc on Volt's home.
Every effort has been made to improve the final episode or be friendly with the pressure, rather than the children's TV about everything.
It's very common.
And like other Johnny English films I couldn't control myself: the British film industry couldn't afford Rowan Atkinson a place to show off his talent?
Labour denies that they have set up a plan for the British to work for four days but pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party considers an astounding plan to see the Britons working on four victims – but paid five.
The group reported that it wants the company's managers to pass on the profits made with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day.
Workers seem to be enjoying three weekends – but they pay the same amount.
Sources say that this vision could fit the economic objective of the group and the program to transform the nation into workers.
The four-day transition has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way to take advantage of the economic reversal.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A police inspection is expected to take place before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen overnight but four days a week but working four days is an aspiration for the team's re-write economy to reap workers and the whole sense of industry."
The Labour Party will not be the first to recommend a strategy, with the Green Party committed to four working days during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the entire workforce has not yet been established.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four days' work is not an organization's policing and is not considered by the party at all."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labor conference to express his views on the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mnz McDonnell said he is determined to mobilize and power back to "unknown directors" and "financial beneficiaries" from the firms.
The Shadow Chancellor also explains that shareholders in the water companies may not find the entire staircase as the Labour government does to 'draw' in the wrong ways.
He also ensured the incorporation of employees into the company's boards and Include Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of the private-sector firms' equity to employees, who will earn a minimum annual profit of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told the FBI's "60 Minutes" that Kavanaugh's investigation could change their minds.
Investigations on FBI charges by judge Brett Kavanaugh have slowed down the time of the election for the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that the findings of the founders could change the way Republican senators influence supporters.
In a Sunday-recorded interview, Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if he could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seems to be more comfortable than his South Carolina counterparts.
"I'm sure," Kennedy said.
"I went to the court, and I spoke to the judge, Kavanaugh.
I called him after he did this, and the accusations came out, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He's stubborn, stubborn, and uninformed."
Graham's vote, however, seems to have been decided.
"My mind has already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a strong criticism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I know this: Brett quickly denies it," Graham added, explaining Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who reads has confirmed that.
It's been 36 years.
I can't see anything change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been trying to alleviate poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual event with a list of actors with the same goal; eliminating poverty in the world.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have a crowd of people streaming into a large park in Central Park dissatisfaction not only with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also with a real sense of purpose to end poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is a sponsor of the Global Poverty Project, a global group that strives to eradicate poverty by increasing the people who are fighting for it.
In order to get a ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for VIP tickets), concerts had to do something that was "actual" such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, calling or doing some other deeper to help you stay awake by eliminating poverty.
How successful has the Global Citizen been in the last 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of benefiting people with a free concert is a good way to try people to do something, or just some so-called "clicktivism" – people who feel like they make a difference by signing a list on a computer or posting on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded the "acts" of their more than 19 million followers, predicting hosting for various purposes.
He said these actions have helped eradicate global investors from <0x24>37 billion in initiatives and initiatives that will affect the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group collected 390 views and notifications from their actions, about <0x24>10 billion was withdrawn or attempted collection.
The group estimates that the revenue generated directly affects approximately 649 million people worldwide.
Other commitments include The Power of Nutrition, partners of U.K. investors and startups dedicated to "helping children in the right way," promised to give Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end hunger in the country after receiving 4,700 tweets on Global Citizens.
"With the establishment of the UK government, donors, governments of countries, and Global Citizens like you, we can try to make history of malnutrition due to lack of justice in the community," the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman revealed at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said it had more than 5,000 years to call the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a project support, Power of Nutrition, that would reach 5 million women and children through access to nutritious food.
In response to some FAQs on their website, they asked "What do you think we can do to eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: "There will be a long and arduous path – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartheid protests before us, we will win, because we are very strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and others who will be featured in this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use antibodies to "block" Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington "if necessary" can use Antitrust to block Russian energy markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke, for the Washington Examiner.
All said the Russian-Syria negotiations - clearly, when it works with the official government's crackdown - are a way to try some new energy markets.
"I believe in the reason why the Middle East seeks to get energy as much as Eastern Europe, and in the middle of geism with Europe," he said.
Also, according to the employee, there are ways to fix it.
"The United States is able, through our military, to ensure that sea routes are opened, and, if necessary, closed, to ensure that their power is not going to market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the participants at a conference hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that called itself a "power user voice" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's efforts to deal with Russia and Iran, saying the results are similar.
"Choosing to trade with Iran and Russia, to some extent, is a way of gaining and obtaining oil," he said, referring to Russia as "a strategic horse" and has an economy that is dependent on oil reserves.
These statements came as Trump's offices made efforts to promote the export of their natural gas liquids to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest route for European consumers.
As a result, Trump's office officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project "unfit", according to Trump, which made Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the Nord Stream 2 pipelines are <0x24>11 billion, scheduled to double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic meters, a truly economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's opposition to the project is consistently due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have the same view that power can't be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose who they buy," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s stance has caused Germany to collapse, re-establishing its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the US to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our export of power," said Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Elizabeth Warren will look" into the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "watch" to enter the presidential election after mid-term elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren has confirmed that he will consider entering the election.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and reorganize our corrupt government which includes a woman who will become a leader," she said.
"After November 6, I'll look at the candidate for presidential election."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting, saying he was "talking to people who were misleading them.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump has done for our people," he said.
Warren was openly criticizing Trump and his selection of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a letter to Tweeter on Friday, Warren said "it is true that we need an FBI investigation before we can vote."
A report released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's supporters do not think they should enter the election by 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts's "possibly" people say the senator should not interfere in elections, according to statistics obtained by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent have supported it.
Statistics show further support for former President Deval Patrick’s election, 38 percent of whom said they were inadequate and 48 percent said they did not.
Some of the names discussed in the top profile Democrats who may have entered the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSD's Track Palin at a Donald Trump summit
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being mobilized in September.
He was arrested and charged with family violence on Monday night.
"What my son is facing, what he is experiencing after his return, I see how he feels about other families facing the traumatic effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers have brought back," he told the audience at the Donald Trump Summit in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other military heroes, "they were once again different, resolute, and wondered if there was any respect for what the soldiers, the air force, and all the other soldiers were doing for their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence for beating a woman, interrupted a report of family violence and had a time of drinking, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the work of the new security policy
The 18 states and the District of Columbia support a new legal effort to adopt a new U.S. policy that prohibits the protection of persons escaping from sexual or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts sent a document to a witness in Washington on Friday to support a person in need of protection against this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions which the American Civil Liberties Union introduced in August against state policy has not been revealed.
He said that his colleagues and his sons were "violent members," who abused him, but U.S. officials agreed to his request for protection on July 20.
He was born in Texas.
Supporters of the state have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produces many people with U.S. protection applications, as nations facing serious problems with domestic violence and abuse.
The new U.S. security policy reversed the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed unpaid immigrants to escape domestic violence.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not take into account decades of federal, international, and international law."
"The law states that all protection requests must be judged on the facts of each case of the application, and making such a decision is a violation of that law," the court said.
Lawyers also pointed out that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering the U.S. economy is detrimental to the economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and "create jobs."
Attorney-General Jeff Sessions advised immigrant judges to no longer protect people who fled domestic violence and crime in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country because of persecution or intimidation because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular party or political ideology," Sessions said in a statement on June 11 on the policy.
Protection was not intended to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - that people face every day around the world.
Efforts are being made in Palu as the number of deaths is quadrupled in efforts to locate survivors
For the survivors, the situation was calm.
"It's really critical," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her son at the center of the survivors in the city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance delivers the bodies.
We don't have clean water."
Residents seem to be returning to their devastated homes, looking for their belongings in plenty of water, trying to find anything they can get.
Hundreds of people were also injured in hospitals, which were damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his spine and shoulder, were sitting outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to an ongoing quake.
Tears welled up in his eyes as he recalled the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and their daughter.
"We didn't have time to find a way to survive.
I was depressed at the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city at the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying, and she was silent again.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are alive."
U.S. Embassy accuses China of "terrorism" over "false advertising"
A week later the Chinese legal newspaper had a four-page advertisement showing U.S. goods for both U.S. and China, a U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using an American newspaper to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of China's paid assets in the Des Moines Register - an Iowa newspaper that was bought by the public - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 election issue that has been held in the U.S.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to get into the U.S. election resulted in what U.S. officials said to Reuters was a new phase in Washington's press campaign for China.
While it is not uncommon for foreign governments to advertise to trade, Beijing and Washington are now trapped in a growing trade war that created an endless exchange of payments for goods.
China's demand for funds at the beginning of the trade war was aimed at harassing delegations in places such as Iowa supporting the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and U.S. analysts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the long-time ruler of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
In China, Branstad wrote in a Sunday newsletter for Des Moines Register, "double this harassment by making false ads in our free newspaper."
"In the region where it has been broadcast, the Chinese government has made itself available to the popular American culture of free speech and free press by posting a paid ad on the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the street-shop of the newspapers here in Beijing, there are not many different opinions you'll find and you won't see the real reaction of the Chinese people to the possible consequences of China's economic crisis, when it is assumed that the media look at it in the face of the Communist Party."
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers has escaped the opportunity to publish" his story, although he did not say which of the newspaper was.
Republicans are disqualifying women who voted before the mid-term elections because of Kavanaugh's failure, to warn critics
As many high-ranking Republicans are waiting and defending the possibility of being indicted to the Supreme Court for several charges of abuse, analysts warn that wood will come back with a concubine, especially for the candidates, during the mid-term elections and the forthcoming season.
The high lungs in this regard, and many Republicans have already expressed their desire to move forward with the election.
Those things will not be postponed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he is skeptical that Senator Jeff Flake's final attempts to investigate the FBI would be enough to cause angry voters to drop their lungs.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a red-headed adviser and national spokesman for the MoveOn development group on Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "It's coming November!" as they protested in the Senate hall as Republicans ruled the Judiciary Committee opted to go ahead and elect Kavanaugh despite the evidence presented by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
"The interest of Democrats and activists will be completely eradicated," said Stu Rothenberg, a politically neutral commentator, telling the media.
"People say it's hot, that's it.
But it can be even higher than that, especially among women's urban voting and young people, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, rarely vote."
Even before Ford's testimony is clear enough of his allegations of abuse against the possibility of being brought to the Supreme Court, analysts say that the fire could come back with a grudge if Republicans continue to verify.
"This has become a GOP devastation," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about a committee vote or a last-minute vote or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the bench, it's about how Republicans treat us and how they treat us," Guy Cecil, director of the Presidency USA, a group that helps people to elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided as to who they believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and they tend to look at Kavanaugh.
New statistics from YouGov show that 41 percent of the people actually or to some extent believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said that for certainty or to some degree Kavanaugh’s.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh had actually or to some extent lied to the evidence he gave, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating charges brought by Ford and at least one plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, vowing that Kavanaugh had abused him while he was drinking at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the defendant in the Supreme Court presented his private organs to him during a party during his study period in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web's founder plans to launch a new online competition with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a program that will compete with rivals Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technology project, Inrupt, is a company built on an open-source Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and the information people are not allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that the purpose of the Inrupt is "to dominate the world."
"We have to do it now," he said.
"It's a history."
This app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may include a list of numbers, what to do, a calendar, a music library, and other technical and human tools.
Such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all are available in the same browser and at the same time.
The important thing about the POD store is that it depends on the user who can find the type of information.
The company calls it a "strong force."
The concept of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company has brought rice, prose and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, contracted contract-makers, and many volunteer co-founders.
From this week, technologists around the world may launch their apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking about "Facebook and Google as to whether or not they should bring about a complete change in which their whole business will change completely.
"We don't ask for your permission."
In a post published in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "sees to empower trade and operating system that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee switched to the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has led a debate on neutrality.
Even with the release of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm looking forward to the start of this next web age," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Congratulations to the priest who received the Victoria Cross of WW1
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier has been praised in his hometown 100 years later.
Pastor Lt Col Bernard Vann was awarded a prize on September 29, 1918 in the Belenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
However, he was killed four days later and did not find out that he had won the largest military award in Britain.
A memorial stone has been opened to his two grandsons during a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "good sign" that the stone was opened in the year 100 exactly since his grandfather received the prize.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his army and crossed the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a flame-throwing explosion with guns and rifles."
He later rushed to the scene of the shooting and with "great courage" he led the way before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German gunman on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions are "something I don't know I could do but something that would make me respect him."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann placed flowers after March, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very privileged to have a part in the march" and said that "the heroism of the real militia is reflected in the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig
Imagine, you're sitting all night to watch the Bellator 206 and you're not allowed to watch the event.
The San Jose event consisted of 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown all night long in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, viewers in the UK were left surprised when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy after waiting all night until the early hours of the morning, especially during the race.
A spokesperson on Twitter described the change in child pornography as "unexpected jokes."
"It is a government law that at 6 a.m. the tournament was inappropriate and therefore had to be changed to the children's system," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the change.
"Pick up the pig, yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they would review their slips to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think if I think about playing it again, I think we can try to play it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday and we can't fix this until Sunday at our time, Monday at their time.
But we are above it.
I'm telling you, at the time of the change, there were many messages sent to it and it was all unpleasant.
We were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I promise it will never happen again.
We're going to keep five matches out of six - as we've often done - and we're trying to please our fans and we've gone too far.
It would have been an unpredictable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "extraordinary" because of his sexuality
Olympian Tom Daley says he grew up to be stunned because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to win.
The 24-year-old said he didn't care until he went to high school saying "not everyone loves me."
Speaking on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which was first broadcast by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights in order to give others "a hope."
He also said that if his parents gave him the opportunity to win the Olympics, he would be interested in winning the Olympics.
A regular late-stage presenter, Kirsty Young, has been out of work for months because she is sick.
From a cast member of Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "unwanted" by everyone as she grew up because "it was not acceptable to love boys and girls."
"To this day, those feelings of worthlessness, a feeling of isolation, and a sense of reality have given me the strength and the strength to succeed," she said.
He wanted to show that he too is a "person," she said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when it was finally discovered that he was gay.
The two-time Olympic gold medal winner has become a high profile LGBT champion and used his position at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to view him as a homophobic.
He said he has spoken because he feels lucky to be able to live a simple life without facing problems and wants to share "hope" with others.
The three-time world championship winner said he was dating a man - U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unexpectedly reaching him."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner, who left her at the age of 20, last year but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you face so much in life at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a person his age who has had similar experiences.
The couple gave birth to a child in June, a son whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "view" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are things that are more important than the Olympic gold medals.
"My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he had asked if they had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be.
"I couldn't say 'I can't be in those games Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he last breathed and until his last breath and he died when I saw that he was also a human like us," he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just realized that this is what I've been looking for all my life - to swim in front of my people at the Olympics, there's nothing better than that," he said.
It also made her choose her favorite song - Heather Small's Proud - which had been in the mood during the Olympics preparation and still inspires her.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is set to sit on a bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to raise the socks so that it will not be a disappointing milestone.
Mickelson, who will be playing at the event once for 12 years, will be sitting on a bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's four and foursomes.
Instead of being the lead, as he often leads when playing for the United States, the five-time winner splits the day into a two-day promotion and worked in his game in hopes of finding out what was bothering him.
Since he is not the best player to score even if he has time for the game, the 48-year-old is not eligible for the Dead Golf National game, where the main play area is often a problem if you hit a ball that goes a long way.
And if the place to play is not so troublesome, Mickelson, who will be playing in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the French Open champion Frances Molinari who is able to beat the right, who played with their youngest Tommy Fleetwood in the tournament to win the championship.
If these Americans, who have lost four points in 12 games of one player, start well, Mickelson's game can be a complete one.
Franklin expressed his confidence in his colleagues, not saying anything else.
"She fully understood the role she played today, held me in the back of her arms and said she would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"You're very self-confident.
He is a great player and has accomplished a lot in the past and this week.
I never thought of him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's what happened and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to play like everyone else."
Mickelson will re-record Nick Faldo's previous record with the number of games he has played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It might be his last game in the Ryder Cup that has never been the same as what he accomplished as a player.
Mickelson has won 18 times, 20 times and played equally for us, although Furyk says his presence has improved the team.
"It's fun to have him, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a fun guy to have him in the club room," she explained.
"I think the young players have enjoyed being with him, and, this week, it was great to see you.
It's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leading with many points doesn't make sense
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows that leading with multiple points when it comes to the last day of the marathon in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough game.
Dane played for the first time in a 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros led by five points over the Americans but ultimately won by one point, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remind yourself that we were leading with many points in Valderrama; we led with many points in Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a few points," said Bjorn, who is in the picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 for both Friday and Friday.
So the story will show me and everyone in that group that it is not over yet.
Do what you can tomorrow.
Be ashamed and do everything in the right way.
It's not until you get the points.
We have a goal, and we are trying to take this cup, and that's what we're focusing on.
I've been saying this for a long time, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we know that there's more to this team - the greatest players in the world."
Impressed by the way his players have played in a difficult position, Bjorn added: "I will never reach conclusions about this.
Tomorrow's game is different.
Tomorrow will determine how each player will play, and that's a different thing.
It's good to go out and play with someone when things go well, but if you play alone, that's when you're fully tested as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to the players, that you do what you can tomorrow.
Now, he's leaving the player or behind and he has to go and do everything he can."
Unlike Bjorn, his competitor Jim Furyk will be looking to get his players to play better on their own than they've ever been discovered, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was able to be both eaten and won on the last day at the last minute, as he was once part of the winning team at Brookline before being eaten when Europe "caught wonders in Medina."
"I remember well," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a 1999 captain, encouraged his players to play on the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but it would be good to start with the top gear as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
As that passion and enthusiasm persists, you put a great deal of pressure on those medium-sized games.
We've organized our players according to that and put our players in the way we think, it will enable us to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to take the lead in combat and return from the game and is facing Rory McIlroy in the lead roles, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top division.
"I'm going with this team because I think it's going to be good for the whole game," Bjorn said.
The German Navy has been rebuilt.
A new type of German Navy pilot called the frigate had to come into operation in 2014 replacing the old Cold War-era fleet, but it will not be available until at least next year due to systems and snowball costs, local media reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" commission, the leader of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed in the first half of 2019, says the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the devastation threatened the future of the project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class single-class Navy long ago in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class fleet.
It is understandable that ships will be equipped with powerful guns, types of bombs that devastate planes and ships, and hidden technologies, such as infrared signals and noise.
Some of the most important items included include long periods of care - it is impossible to use new ships until two years from the ship's point of departure.
However, the ongoing mandate means that an important development of the fleet - which will give Germany power overseas - will be outdated when it goes into operation, Die Zeit said.
The F125 dead-end ship appeared on paper last year, when the German Navy refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blommbnase Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned to the ship that was made after it was delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the ship's retreat, but German media have said there was a significant problem with the "software and hardware" that made the warship useless when it was sent to war.
Software problems were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be used by a crew of 120 sailors - part of the crew of the old Bremen class.
It has also emerged that the ship has a much higher weight than it needs to reduce its effectiveness and reduce the chances that the Navy will be able to insert the materials that will improve it in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have weighed twice as much as the same ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides hardware problems, the entire cost of the project - including training a crew of sailors - was also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached an impressive sum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 million (<0x24>3.6 billion) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 million.
The problems of the new ships are very important as there have been recent warnings that the German naval power was declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, a German official of the parliamentary committee, admitted to the Navy that it "cares well for the exit and entry of the vessels that can be used."
The officer said that the problems had gone away in time, since the old ships were no longer in operation but no ships were in their positions.
He was disappointed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is committed to protecting wildlife
A new study conducted in the Scottish Highlands area aims to reveal how bats use their habitat when hunting for food.
It is hoped that the results will give us a better understanding of the life-style of these rare flying creatures and will help guide future conservation operations.
A scientific study at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the traditional singing pistrelles and Daubenton bats with long brown ears at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special records will be set at certain locations to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will conduct small surveys using hand-held monitors.
A logical analysis of all records by scientists will show the frequency of bats’ cries and what certain animals do.
A map of their locations and a report will be published to create a detailed local picture of their lifestyle.
Rob Dewar, NTS zoo adviser, hopes the results will reveal what areas are most important to bats and how these animals use them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of local management activity such as meadow creation and the best way to preserve bat-tree habitats and other related animals.
Butterflies in Scotland and the rest of the UK are rare throughout the last century.
They are threatened by construction and the invention of materials that affect their habitat and loss.
Electrical generators and lighting can cause harm, and it can also be the case with fly-dead paper and logistics, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Animals aren't really visible.
However, since they hunt at night, their ears are more active than their eyes when they hunt for an animal.
They use an intricate ability to detect the source of noise to locate animals and objects in their flight environment.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, considers bats important.
It consists of ten professional experts, who conduct regular inspections, check their habitat, and how to protect them.
The organization even organized the Scottish peninsula's first and only Threave bats in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten Scottish bat species.
David Thompson says this is the best place to stay.
"It's a very nice place for dogs here," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of big trees and other beautiful places.
But there's so much about bats that we can't do, so the work we do here and in other buildings will help us understand more about what it takes to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of assessing whether there are pre-workout bats in buildings because it is likely that damage to their single habitat would kill some 400 young bats, almost killing all in the area.
Fleas are protected and are prohibited by law from killing, harassing, harassing, or destroying their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to come and help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and most of our species don't know what makes them survive," he said.
Ronaldo denies allegations of abuse as lawyers plan to charge a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has spoken of allegations that he has accused him of "false stories," saying people "wanted to improve themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers planned to charge the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portuguese actress and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He has reportedly paid <0x24>375,000 to shut down the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live video with 142 million followers after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo said the reports were "false."
"No, no, no, not.
"What they're saying today is false news," said a five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
"They try to make a name for themselves by using my name.
It is common.
They want me to be a writer, but it's a part of my job.
"I'm happy and everything is fine," he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are ready to punish Der Spiegel for the allegations, calling them "an unacceptable report of allegations affecting personal life," Reuters said.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the player would seek a refund of "the amount of damage to his dignity in the amount of the amount he is mostly charged with, which is probably the most serious violation of human rights in recent times."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player’s room, where he allegedly came and abused him, in line with papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was "prepared" for "99<0x25>" of errors with "one percent."
Officials said Ronaldo had agreed to have sex with both of them, but they agreed.
Mayorga also admitted to the police and took photos of the injured in the hospital, but later admitted that the matter was taken out of court because she feels "fear of revenge" and worried about "public disgrace."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to change the contract as she continues to be damaged by what is said to have happened.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the allegations were reported, and this year he switched to Italian club Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK will "relentlessly regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will always regret it" if it does not lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He has also added that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily suspend its production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese designer said the effect of delays on the border in the event of a failed agreement with Brexit could result in loss of jobs.
The Burnaston industry - which makes Auris and Toyota's Avensis - has produced about 150,000 cars last year and 90<0x25> have been exported to other European Union countries.
"What I think is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, the product will stand in our industry," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Some UK car manufacturers have threatened to leave the EU without an agreement on how trade with other countries will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini industry in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern lies in what car designers call accidents in the event of failure to meet Brexit agreements.
The Toyota product is operated "according to the need at the time", with auto parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU according to ordered vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be obstacles to those borders that the industry says could lead to delays and the end of automotive parts.
It's impossible for Toyota to hold more than one car a day built in their factory in Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may need to be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's future deal with the EU was "carefully adjusted to avoid the border checks."
"We need to get a deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us as not only to win now but to hold this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other industries is that we need to be fully able to continue what the providers have been successful for a long time."
Toyota has not been able to say how long the product will be suspended, but in time, it warns that the increase in cost will reduce the industry's success and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a coordinator for the Unite industry, says: "In what I have seen these jobs end and never come back.
"We have put in place a clear and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU," a government spokesman said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may also be delayed, the White House said.
Donald Trump's long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be "submitted for another week" as the high court's battle with Brett Kavanaugh's appointment continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special councillor Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian elections, communications between Trump and Russia and possible unfair interference from the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the general attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s freedom, has provided Washington with months of debate.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had negotiated a pipeline to record negotiations with Trump and the possibility of the president's dismissal on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there are reports that he is about to quit his job.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "desperately" not to attack Rosenstein but a meeting was delayed to avoid confrontation with a Senate judiciary where Kavanaugh was one of the women who accused him of abusing, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom became witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, further reducing the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's secretary of state, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
In an interview with Rosenstein, he said: "The day of that has not yet been set, whether this week, I think that will be postponed another week as there are other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'd love to keep the media aware of what's going on."
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the decline in these meetings is not because the media are "talking," although he has said: "I can't deny the fact that they are talking."
He added that the relationship between Trump and the media would be intertwined.
"The president makes more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him," he said, adding without giving evidence: "We have looked at those figures."
There will still be meetings, Sanders said, but "if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me."
We're trying to do that many times and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to replace a press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually listens to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or media conferences with respectable guests.
He rarely asks questions when he is alone.
This week, the president of New York has probably pointed out why, by indifference and sometimes by indifference in front of the press.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in the NHS in Scotland about the fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU workers working in Scotland's NHS to express national appreciation and wishes for their stay in the post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to paying the required fees for EU citizens working for public assistance.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, focusing on decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also been preparing its plans for a non-contract.
I know this may not be a good time for everyone.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work that all members of the staff do, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners from the EU, and elsewhere, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, to the benefit of patients and the communities we work for.
"Scottland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christy Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers Christy Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after a head injury on Saturday when they were defeated by the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State trainer Rod Reed told the media that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the floor and fell to the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie a breath of fresh air on the bench before placing him on the stretcher took him back to check on him.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the nature/ extent of the injury at the moment" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red student, in his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He also scored five times on Saturday before retiring from the game, resulting in a total of 18 times marking season.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamps when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged an extra stamp fee when they buy a house in the UK for this money to be used to help those who do not have accommodations under the new Tory plans.
This will make it difficult for Corbyn to get the young people to vote.
Increased tax rates are required for those who do not pay taxes in the UK
Investors expect to earn about <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp fee if they buy a house in the UK - this money will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be considered an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in an attempt to attract new people to vote for more inexpensive housing and to look at people who earn more money.
The promotion of stamp money will apply to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and this additional amount will help in the government's attempt to eliminate the homeless.
This additional fee - which adds to the current price of the stamp, including the high-levels that were installed two years ago in the second house and sold - can be about three percent.
Investors expect this to give them some <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's rebuilt houses are bought by non-UK citizens, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to find housing.
Many of the wealthiest places in the country - especially the capital - have become "cities crying out for ruin" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time away from the country.
The new policy came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke about the reduction in the price of the stamp in order to help more youngsters get their first homes.
He has accused businesses of maintaining higher housing prices by taking up the construction site and not using it, and has urged Mrs May to close the quotas in affordable housing to correct the British "house scandal."
Mr. Corbyn announced a series aimed at the proposed change in housing, including the management of rental funds and the termination of "innocent" eviction.
He also wants to provide more energy to build new homes.
"Last year I said I would commit myself to reviving the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation," Mrs May said.
This means the sale of homes.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, it would not be fair for non-UKs, as well as foreign companies, to buy housing rather than hard-working British citizens.
For so many people, the dream of having a house has become inaccessible, and the lack of dignity to sleep on the street is not over."
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to be a Scottish coach"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says he has "a great wish" for Scotland's coach one day.
Ross, 42, wishes the challenge to help the North-East team, now third in League One, is left with three points by the senior team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership in the previous season.
"I wanted to play as a player.
I got a B cap and that's how it ended," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, and it's always been something I think about.
I can only get that opportunity, however, if I succeed as a coach of a small team."
Sunderland's predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross, former Alloa Athletic coach, said he was not afraid to enter after these senior coaches in the big team, as he has rejected applications from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me now will be determined by the question, 'Can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and features of the club, it must undoubtedly be entered into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get back there, but I'll probably consider myself a winner if I can get back to the club."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, after a short while as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a Hearts trainer.
He then helped Alloa escape from the loss, and turned St Mirren's nearly stabbed to the Champions Cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Everything changed completely," he recalls, by training Alloa.
"I was convinced that the training work was better for me than a player.
It sounds ridiculous because I played well, I was healthy, and there were some things I enjoyed.
But playing is not easy.
There are many things to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to work stress and stress, but I love training.
I've been wanting to train for a long time and now I'm doing it, I feel that I'm doing what I want to do the rest of my life as an adult."

The best time for the pint is 5.30pm on Saturday, according to a survey
In the summer, the British drainage pipes were difficult but hard to carry at the restaurants.
Groups of pipelines and bars were raised by 2.7 per cent in July - but restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent, statistics say.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who received the figures, says: "The continued success and participation of England for longer than expected at the World Cup means that July followed the same path as last June, when the pipelines rose by 2.8 percent, except for the stores.
The decline of 1.8 percent in retail sales in June has worsened in July.
The bars and bars are more expensive than the restaurants.
Pumps sell food with heavy loads in the sun, although it was not as bad as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of it and get some drink.
"The number of food and drinks sold this month has increased by 6.6 percent, and the price of food has dropped by 3 percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM reviewer for pleasure and hospitality, said: "These results are progressive that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large events or sports will always be strong reasons when it comes to selling in the market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to pull hard, although sales drop by 4.8 percent annually will be painful despite ongoing costs problems.
"The long hot summer has come very badly at the food stores and in time it will be evident that the low temperatures we have in August will give us what we need."
The increase in sales in pipelines and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a decline in prices in the brand.
The Coffer Peach Tracker's retailer for the pipeline industry, bars and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes the working data of 47 working groups, generates more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million, and is the start of a development industry.
One out of every five children has private social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - the other 11 years old - have confidential accounts that are hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school children showed an increase in "false Insta" pages.
The media is concerned about the sexual harassment
20<0x25> of people say they have a "good" account that shows children.
One in five children - some 11 years old - open social media accounts that are hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school children showed a rapid growth in "false Instagram accounts" - referring to the Instagram posting site.
The news has sparked fears of sexual harassment.
About 20 percent of those who say they use a clean account "which is the best" they show to parents, while others are confidential.
One mother who somehow saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found a teenager asking others to "rape her."
This study, of the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) in private schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of them agree to have confidential accounts.
"It's frustrating that so many young people are tempted to create online accounts where parents and teachers can't find them," says HMC manager Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the players" on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was selected by the Scottish Athletics board as the chairman at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish actor and chairman Ian Beattie has described this act as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to benefit from his extensive experience in sports involving other countries over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all players in the world and we are confident that sports in Scotland will benefit the most by bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
"I'm determined to be the voice of the players and hope to contribute a lot and help guide the sport in Scotland," said Doyle.
The American player, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between his four Olympic medals and is now a BBC regular, found himself unable to walk after a stroke (TIA).
He wrote on Twitter: "Last month, I died in a stroke.
I was unable to walk.
Doctors told me that in time it would show me how much or how much I would recover.
I've been working hard, but I've learned to walk and now I'm doing it!
Thank you for the encouragement!"
A mother's milk pumping ad compared to cows creates a breakdown on the Internet
A company that pumps breastfeeding has created an online breakthrough through advertising that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfeeding cows.
To mark the installation of what is said to be "the world's first noisy breast pump," Elvie's customer company has released a comics video ad to showcase the freedom that a new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers sing a song in a cowboy with the words, "Yes, I kiss myself, but you don't see me" and "If you don't see this, it's my breasts."
He said, "I'm going to take a shower, I'm going to take it out, I'm going to take it out, I'm going to take it out, I'm going to take it out, I'm going to get my friends."
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has created an online controversy.
The video, with more than 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, has received mixed views from viewers, where many say it undermines the "heavy" weight of the dairy industry.
"It's a very difficult decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"As if they need to get pregnant and give birth to milk, unless their babies are taken within days of birth," one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump enters hidden inside the breast bra (Elvie/Mother)
"It's a difficult situation for both mother and baby," one said.
"Why don't you use it as a gift for the mothers who can't take care of their babies?"
Another said, "This is not a good idea."
Some of the people in the audience said they found the song "smile."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would buy it if I were still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a bit of a mess, but I've heard what it means.
"This product will be very useful," another wrote.
Another commented: "This ad is funny and refers to pumping mothers (usually at work or in private rooms) and they feel like " cows."
This is not an advertisement that honors or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video a group of women showed that they had been dancing with hidden pumps under their braces.
The purpose of the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump, no sound, no strings or tubes and wears it hidden under the breast bra, gives women the freedom to move, hold their children, and pull them out of the pump.
Ana Balarin, the ECD partner for Mother, has commented: "Elvie Pump is a product that will be very conducive so you deserved a way to advertise it in a clear way.
By comparing breastfeeding women to cattle we wanted to put in public pumping the breasts and all its challenges, while expressing in a pleasant and understandable way a feeling of relief from the new pump to be brought.
This is not the first time Elvie's bomb has been questioned.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared in the designer Martha Jacobowski's catwalk using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Move Peacefully to a Tent Camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children has increased even though it did not change the number of month-to-month passers-by, partly because the tough police stationed in the Trump office made it difficult to provide supportive children.
Often, many supporters have become paperless immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their chance of staying in this area by identifying themselves as a parent.
The accident was worse in June, when authorities announced that supporters and other adult members of the home will have to send fingerprints, and that data will be delivered to immigrant authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, admitted before Congress that the agency has arrested many people who have registered to support children without parents.
The agency later admitted that 70 percent of those incarcerated were free of criminal charges.
"Almost 80 percent of non-supporting people or family members are illegal here, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to look for those people," said Mr. Albence.
Wanting to prosecute children promptly, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not 60 days later, which was the previous law, in accordance with the shelter staff.
Most will appear on the video conference phone, not literally, to request legal rights from a foreign judge.
Those that are considered unfit will soon be removed.
If children live longer in detention, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which could lead to violence or trying to escape, in line with the shelter staff and reports released from the system in the past months.
Lawyers say this concern is growing at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's serious pull may be ignored, due to local magnitude.
They also add that transporting children to a tent city without taking the time to prepare emotionally or to greet friends can cause many of the distractions that they already have.
Syria tells U.S., French, and Turkish troops to "invade" immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in their country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally in Syria, saying they would put an end to terrorism, and "will be treated fairly."
"He has to leave immediately," he said to the audience.
Moualem has claimed that "the fight against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been evacuated from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred war and clean up the entire area of Syria" from terrorist groups and "everyone from another country."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, focusing on training and directing forces in the Kurdish and Syrian Arab opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 foot soldiers in a war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said circumstances allow them to return, and blames "some western countries" for "terrifying them" which has made it impossible for refugees to return.
"We have spoken to the international community and humanitarian organization to ensure that refugees return," he said.
"It's a political issue that should only be handled by the public."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help Syria re-establish her until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and those opposed to the end of the war.
UN ambassadors say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a border at the Idlib's last major heretic fort has the opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented the massive invasion of the Russian-backed forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem insisted that the agreement was "foreordained" and hoped that the army would attack the jihadists and the Nustra Front-linked fighters, "who will be destroyed."
UN ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon organize the first meetings of a new committee that includes government and opposition members to draft the constitution after the Syrian war and modify the electoral process.
Moualem set the limits of the Syrian government's participation on the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be kept "in view of the topics of the new constitution," and warned of interference.
Why Trump won the second round of elections
In that sense, Mr. Trump could win a second election in 2020 unless, as there were many unchecked viewers who might wish to be so, be dishonest and do the wrong thing that could remove him from office.
This is definitely the "most important thing in the history of the world!"
So far, there has been no evidence that viewers are tired of this.
As of 2014, CNN's viewers have doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC's viewers nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News usually has 2.4 million viewers, ranging from 1.7 million in the last four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" lead with 3.5 million viewers in hot night news.
"People are curious because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designed Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, who is red in the field of writing and developing comics called "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another view.
He was on a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because you make me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
It's fun to watch and listen to these stories.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, regardless of whether foreign families are at peace and have a global economic climate.
Very few people are aware of these issues.
And then, it's more than a knowledgeable citizen if you find yourself sitting for more than six hours watching a panel of experts arguing over the use of Bob Woodward's source of "deep root" in his book "Fear," Paul Trumpfort's leather jacket is worth <0x24>15,000 ("a sleeveless post,"

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss’ home this week, it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
It would not allow him to leave his presence, it would not be possible as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court uncertain.
"I remember in the past we made all these crazy programs and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was funny, but it seemed right."

Cash prizes are included in the mid-season selection of the home competition
Not surprisingly, the 17th-century earns capital gains, thanks to the re-establishment of the congressional districts that came out with two managers competing for the same seat.
The newly remodeled Pittsburg region puts him in the contest for Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another county in a special election last spring.
Lamb is still competing for another round, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which crosses the full 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution by stealing votes to the Republicans.
The competition in this 17-year-old has eliminated a financial campaign competition between members of the main group, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March that was attended by the majority of Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That position was held by the Republicans for more than a decade, President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
The Democrats have given the Democrats a chance.
The U.S. considers punishment for El Salvador for supporting China, and then withdraws
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already marked Beijing, with a small appeal from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a free meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and served as a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Organization's governing body.
State Department officials have decided to call again the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the latest decision not to work with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, said earlier this month.
But only El Salvador has been fined <0x24>140 million for helping the United States in 2017, and for managing narcotics, development and economic support.
An estimated ransom, which includes financial relief cuts and distributed restrictions on visas, which could have hurt the country in Central America because of an increase in unemployment and murder.
As their meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on defence and economic development to follow a similar rally last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrant travel to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking executives made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead, effectively ending any idea of paying El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should now plan to speak to a conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol brought by the authorities to the meeting, the officials said.
And three U.S. ambassadors peacefully return to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new powerful messages or sanctions from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of a debate posed on three U.S. officials, including two delegates, who agreed to negotiate internal intentions in the form of privacy.

A Lesson From History
The following incident may be Robert Mueller's special advisor's report on Mr. Trump's opposition to justice, and now there is clear evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was linked to Russia in its efforts to attack our elections.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself facing trial in this group, as he prepares to stand before the people who will vote, and perhaps finally before a court.
This has a lot of issues, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall will definitely happen - or his colleagues in Europe.
There are decisions we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the negotiations.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up a "coup d"état against Hitler, as long as the West was against him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such instances, and endless efforts to fight for democracy become stronger or have failed for years.
The United States now faces many of these situations.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person in charge of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested privately recording the president and spoke of his failure to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the F.B.I.'s newly requested investigation is incomplete or unjust - or if it is filed in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the Middle Ages for Congress to prosecute Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, democracy will not be accomplished for long.
But I believe that we will never fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz as the same Nazi regime that once ruled my homeland.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light the candles on the Sabbath on a swastika table.
I have that as an inheritance, how can I not have hope for our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is hoping as the game approaches Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a better pass to Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented gastrointestinal player Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 match with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers could use those results to look forward to big things.
"It's great to get this point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We've come back to the game and we've got a point.
We could get the goal at the end, but, otherwise, playing equally is also good.
They played better than we played in the first round, and in the second we played better.
We're playing another European game on Thursday.
We hope we get three points but it will be a tough game because they played well in the previous game but, because our fans will be encouraging us, I'm sure we'll play and get good results.
Last year was a tough one, in the midst of all the things that happened to my injury and change in the team itself but things seem to be going well now.
The team is good and the players are happy; it's fun when training.
We hope that we will work now, pass the previous season, and succeed."

Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how much they needed care, few people were talking to their families about it.
Nearly half of the people in a national survey say they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take steps to discuss it," Holly Snyder, deputy president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Let's start with it.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot provide for your family if you do not tell them your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss how and where you will receive care, as those decisions can have a profound effect on determining the cost.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you to find a way to cover those expenses.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include a long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy that provides you with money if you cancel so that you can pay for these expenses or become your health insurance - as long as you still have the money.
Warnings: Avoid legal battles.
Get a healthcare proxy to establish a trusted person to take care of your treatments and make sure that the doctors comply with your wishes in case you are unable to speak.
Also, consider the power of the attorney for your money.
You will choose someone you trust to make decisions for you about your finances and ensure that your expenses are paid if you can no longer do anything.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is being treated for a health emergency and is rushed to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and substances that affect him?
Write down the details in order to prepare for the situation.
"It's not just money that should be taken into account, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in an earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials say, the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were ineffective, aid workers were unable to get information from Donggala authorities, the northernmost area of Palu near the center of 7.5 earthquakes.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been deported after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located on the western edge of the island of Sulawesi, and has a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary during the tsunami.
Donggala is an area of more than 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The area, the province's sub-region, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are lifestyles in the Central Sulawesi region, mostly the coastal region of Donggala.
Mining coins are also important in the region, they are found in abundance in Morowali, along the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the motion of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some areas that have been hit by major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A devastating earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian state of Aceh in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people near the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of Aceh.
2005: A consecutive earthquake struck the western coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, creating a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, a tsunami of about 10 meters that devastated many areas and killed 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh, destroying and causing horrific memories of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The attack destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of homeless visitors.
Sarah Palin's Oldest Son Sentenced To Domestic Violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former president and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on torture charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on charges of torture, harassment and resistance to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report the crime, she picked up the phone.
Palin has been arrested at the Matt-Su Pretrial Facility and charged with an unprotected bond of <0x24>500, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "innocent, certainly" when he was questioned, reporting the network.
Palin faces three charges in Class A, which means he could be jailed for a year and charged with a fine of <0x24>250,000.
The accused will also be charged with a fine of <0x24>2,000 a day.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was charged with beating his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case is currently in the hands of the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, infringing on a report of domestic violence, and armed robbery in connection with the incident.
His daughter had hit him with a knife in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by professional groups in 2016 after her son's violent actions were linked to PTSD caused by his work in Iraq.
Tsunami earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and damaged thousands of homes.
Electronic networks and communications are ineffective and the number of deaths may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the northeastern part of Sulawesi, the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Videos are posted on social media to show what happened.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
State prosecutors demand a rare death sentence for the suspected terrorist in NYC
State prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence of Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist suspect who killed eight people - an unprecedented sentence that has not been issued in this area since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle route on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists on that road in Oct.
In order for them to be able to execute, prosecutors would have to show that Saipov had "intentionally" killed eight people and "willedly" inflicted severe physical harm, in line with the announcement of an attempt to obtain the death penalty, issued by the Southern District of New York.
Both acts carry the weight of the death penalty, in accordance with the court's document.
Some weeks later, the trial court sentenced Saipov to 22 counts including eight counts of murder, often used by state prosecutors on organized crime charges, and a case of violence and car damage.
The attack required "preparation and positive thinking," said prosecutors, explaining how Saipov did it as "bad, cruel and shocking."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, killed the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrocelo, and Hernando Diego,"
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York finally handled the case of the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug users but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in New York’s case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married people who were executed after being found guilty of confiscating the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has indicated that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told police that he felt good about what he had done, he said.
Saipov told the authorities that the reason he had attacked in this way was to watch ISIS videos on his phone, in line with the statement he made.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He said he was not charged with 22 counts.
David Patton, a public defender representing Saipov, says they are "desperately disappointed" by the court's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a prison sentence without the possibility of release will only open the door to shock in these circumstances to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had urged the prosecutors not to accept the death penalty.
The Tory Minister said the NIGEL FARAGE should conduct talks with Brexit
Nigel Farage vowed to "organize society" today during a protest at the Tory congress.
The former Ukip leader said politicians needed to be "suffered" by Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's ministers said she should be the EU's president.
An unofficial member of parliament Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have left" if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in bringing together members of her separate group has been marked by older Tory members joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has failed to keep his Chequers withdrawal plan going smoothly despite the attacks by members of Brexit, the Remainers and the EU.
Other members have insisted that they will continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels in spite of the dispute - and have forced Eurosceptics and Labor to choose between his package and the 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Leaving Meaning in Solihull that he wants to 'finish with Chequers'.
Mr. Farage said he should be made a pillar and be given the task of communicating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have gone now," he said.
"I'm going to represent Brexit but we have to finish with the Chequers," he said.
Describing his differences with the EU, he says: "We did not fight the world wars to become slaves.
We want to make our own laws."
Mr Bone said that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 general election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to remain untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory supporters of Brexit was also in the process, telling the gunmen: 'What I'm saying is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"People who don't want Chequers, the opposition party won't vote for them, our party doesn't want our people who see them walking on the streets and make us vote from the start.
Don't forget to listen to the chorus."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she said: "The Prime Minister will continue to perform his duties if he keeps his promises."
Mr Farage told a protester that they should be "pressed" if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of honesty between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to be dishonest with Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not going to let you do that.'"
In a strong message to the crowd, he said: 'I want you to make a political party, now in danger of Brexit, feeling pressured.
"We are using the civil society of this country that has made us victorious over Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, independent country, a proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remainers protested in Birmingham before a two-hour call to the city.
The main activists carried the Tories Anti-Brexit posters after the group was formed this week.
A Labour member Lord Adonis made a joke about the security problems the Conservatives had with the group's app at the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all Canadian technology and so on, a free border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's a complete destruction.
"There's no such thing as Brexit," he added.
Warren's plans to "consider" the presidential election
U.S. Sen says Elizabeth Warren will "consider the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats talked about their future in a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is always critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against the country's GOP. Geoff Diehl, former Trump's chairman at the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He was on the verge of competing with Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th congress using the city hall since Trump became president.
Someone asked him if he was going to make a decision.
Warren replied that it is time for women to "go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman who will become president."
A man shot and killed LSU player Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday, announced that he had been arrested by a shooter who killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He released a video showing the shooting on Friday, asking for help explaining the man who appeared in the tomb.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, 247sports.
Wayde claimed to have defended his friend and then shot Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to the scene, that he carried a weapon, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without fighting and imprisoned in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-6-footed boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games and made 10 starts in the last season in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to get a world title after following the team's directions that led him to defeat Sebastian Vettel.
It was clear when Valtteri Bottas won over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's directions would play a major role in the competition.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and probably competed with Hamilton as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be banned from the team's tail, which was supposed to be his decision.
Mercedes entered the pit after the round and became behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of the competition which made the Ferrari driver forced to leave the inside unharmed after two years of defending the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and became the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he continued his wheels to swing to finish faster and pass Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He eventually reached the pits in the 44th round but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen was fourth.
It's been a tough day because Valtteri has done a good job all weekend and you've been kind enough to pass me on.
"The team has done a great job with 1-2," Hamilton said.
His body's movement is rich.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday's campaign as he insisted he did not show anyone a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing High Court prosecutor Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment charges.
Speaking at the West Virginia legislature, the president did not directly address the testimony given by the Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what happened to the Senate showed that the people were "unreasonable and untrustworthy."
"One thing that could have happened a few days ago in the Senate, if you see anger, when you see angry, unreasoning, unreasoning and untrustworthy people," he said.
"When you look at the news and say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diana Feinstein said to her.
Do you remember the answer to the question, "What is it?"
Oh, no.
I didn't send anyone."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no," he said, referring to the senator.
Feinstein was sent a detailed letter about Kavanaugh's allegations by Ford back in July, and appeared in early September - but Feinstein denied that the document had left his office.
"I didn't hide the claims of Dr. Ford, I didn't send anyone," Feinstein told the committee, reporting The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret just as I asked."
But his denial was not well heard by the president, who commented during a Saturday night rally: "This is what I can say, the movement of his body is rich.
He may not have done it, but his movement is rich."
Continuing her defense of the High Court's prosecutor, who was accused of harassment by three women, the president said Democrats used the lawsuits in their interests.
"He's ready to fight for everything he can do.
He sees a lack of kindness, carelessness, no matter who's hurt, who's to go through in order to govern and control," the media reported in a statement issued by the president.

A plane pilot dies to save hundreds of passengers from an earthquake
An Indonesian airliner is praised after his death to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers arrives safely on the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after the massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which triggered the tsunami.
There are strong movements to continue invading the area and many are trapped in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for survival, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave work on a building that was struggling to control the aircraft at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He sat down to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, on the way, would be able to get off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control building when he thought we were crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC News of Australia.
We have arranged a helicopter flight from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we failed and he died this morning before the flight to Palu.
"Our hearts are saddened by this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands as the relief agency says it is difficult to enter the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the death toll is still increasing as more and more bodies were still under devastation while more were not able to reach them," said Sutopo Purwo Numgroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six feet [6 m] have devastated Palu, which will have a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and transport aircraft bring relief supplies and life-sustaining supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute an ambulance delivers the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
"The markets are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, manager of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross helps the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a disaster, but it can be even worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to finish all the work on the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people were killed.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says one person has been missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
An airline directing a plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person is missing, after all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said on Saturday afternoon, he will not be able to report on a male passenger.
The airline said it had worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the suspect.
The airline did not respond immediately when asked to disclose details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats have helped other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers are still in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in a bad eye.
The cause of the crash and how it happened are unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy have said that a lagoon flight had not arrived at the airport.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has passed the route.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flown at a low speed.
"That's really good," Jayne said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to navigate the water he kept on his back to the emergency exits on a sinking plane.
He said the pilots were busy and spoke, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says that sailors working closely to improve the wharf also assisted in the evacuation of passengers by boat so that people could reach the shore before the plane sank 30 meters [100 feet] of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in the PNG-registered airline crashes in the past 20 years but none include Air Niugini.
An analyst reveals the nighttime of a woman who has been burned alive
The prosecutor filed a lawsuit on Saturday against a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used telephone records to locate the locations of 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received details about the location of several phone calls that showed that Tellis had-the Chambers on the afternoon of his death, contradicting what he said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When details indicate that his phone was in the rooms during the time he said he had a friend; Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was right when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "nominated because his truck was in Nashville."
In addition, Tellis said he had known Chambers two weeks before his death.
Telephone records show that they knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said some time before Chambers's death, Tellis turned off Chamber's emails, phone calls, and contact details on his phone.
"It took him out of his life," says Hale.
He is scheduled to speak on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to go to the jury on that day.
High Breed: What's Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop group wants to challenge negative views of this kind of music by filling their songs with positive words.
High Breed, from Bristol, says hip hop is no longer what it was originally about having political messages and talking about social problems.
He wants to get back into the habit and make a conscious hip hop renowned again.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have later seen an increase in the UK in singers such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's a black man?!
A NY child's guardian accuses parents of evicting him of a "prejudice" message
A New York child's guardian accuses a man and his wife of excommunication after they received a message from the mother of a child who mistakenly said he was "another black."
Parents deny that they are biased, claiming that the allegations were made "for the purpose of making money."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she found out that her youngest child, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on the first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After seeing her manager, "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, who said that her child's lover, an African-American, had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid a day’s work and sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses parents of unfairly dismissing her, and wants a compensation of <0x24>350 in 6 months, and a live-in gig she has been hired for, without a contract.
"I wanted to show you, look, they weren't doing that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know that there is racism."
The parents responded about their prejudices, saying that chasing Maurice was a good thing they had done, fearing that they would lose their trust after mistreating him.
"My wife told me something she didn't want to say.
He is not partial.
"We're not biased people," Joel Plasco told the Post.
"How can you leave your children and a person with whom you're green, even when you're wrong?"
Your child's newest?
Well, all right."
Comparing the allegations to "financial gain," Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby for two months and was "in a very difficult situation."
"You're going to attack that guy?"
"That's not a good thing," the banker adds.
As the case progresses, the public opinion court has hastened to blame the parents on the links, not encouraging what they have done.
Paddington’s editors feared that readers would not like the talk, the newspaper revealed.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was loved, said in a book: "It's hard to put yourself on someone's shoes for the first time before it's published.
It's nice to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
He says his father, who had worked on the BBC as a photographer before he was moved to write a children's book about a small toy bear, would not have been surprised if his work had not been popular, adding the 60th anniversary of his book's publication was "painful and fun" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, which he described as "the most important member of our family," he added that his father was not breastfeeding for his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was as if you had a child that accomplished something: you're proud of it even if it didn't work for you.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was invented and thought by him, he always praised Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her.
Her daughter was rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"Nad was always on the phone saying it was too bad, saying he didn't expect to survive," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad that he would die in two minutes from now and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I greeted them.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, help me."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given by the doctors to keep her heart rate slow and deteriorate.
He died some time earlier, and this was no longer working.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really needed to control myself."
Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourns her daughter's death, flew in a plane with other passengers - apparently due to the tragic situation she was facing.
"No one knows," he said.
"I looked down, and there were always tears in my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but it's when I'm on the plane I feel sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much I love him."
A woman pulls a card to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost a loved one in death work together to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been collecting cards on a Welsh bridge with encouraging words and telephone numbers that people can use to get help.
Mrs. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," said Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a cook with a promising future and that when everyone smiled, everyone smiled.
"They were all smiling.
"They always smile when it's all good."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, became the first person to find him after his suicide.
"I'm always worried that something will happen almost exactly the same," said Mrs. Davis.
Mrs. Davis began making cards, "to let people know that there are people to talk to, even if they are friends.
You don't have to talk, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Mrs. Davies’ friend for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old fiancé, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed how different things were.
He said that on Christmas Day he was down in a different direction - when the children opened their gifts he didn't look at them or do anything."
He said his death was very distressing, but they had to deal with it: "It opens a big gap in the family.
It is very painful.
We all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought, if we could actually find something similar to what he was looking for - a quick, minor investigation - we could bring some unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "separate between" as there were many supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
What they miss is a result of time.
The mid-term elections will take place on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans fail, then they will be weakened in their efforts to find a candidate to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been taking a phone call from the Senators, encouraging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and there he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a Senate election, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to separate equality and bring him to the Supreme Court.
"North Korea" under Kim
The number of dissidents from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legal expert said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing the details of the Southern Union department, says there were 1,127 heretics last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says border laws have been tightened between North Korea and China, and the high cost of underground recruitment of workers has had a significant impact.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of heretics from the North eventually gain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many fled to China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with a defensive line between the two Koreas.
China considers these slums to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly return them to their countries.
Relations between the North and the South - still at war in a sense - have improved dramatically over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss mainly the suspension of nuclear disarmament talks.
This was after a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a number of ways to work on the elimination of nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. authorities of not taking action since then.
"Unless the U.S. hopes, there will be no hope for our country's security and under those circumstances, we will never discard our weapons alone first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "strongly controlled," saying she is not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Party leader Nancy Pelosi called the candidate of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh a "mood-controlled" and said his emotions do not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
The statement was made at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I just thought that if a woman ever acted like that, she would be called 'controlled by emotions,'" Pelosi said in his response to Kavanaugh's speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied emotionally that she has sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she was younger.
During his first words, Kavanaugh spoke out emotionally, in one of the highlights and annoyances while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also denounced the Democrats to the committee, calling the allegations of "shocking information in a systematic manner to kill" organized by people who were upset that Hillary Clinton was defeated in the 2016 election.
Pelosi said he believes that Kavanaugh's evidence shows that he will fail to serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is against the Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unfit with those words and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi refused when asked if he would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was indicted, and that the Democrats won many seats in the House of Representatives.
"Here's what I'll say - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it means that he's not only qualified to the Supreme Court, but also to the court that he's not in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as a Democrat he is concerned that Kavanaugh may judge against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is thought to be an arbitrary judge.
When questioned, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he could answer some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
"This is not the time for an emotionally controlled person, who takes the side to court and is expected to say, 'It's all right,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to use their power.
Proper discipline, months and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to free you from grief.
"We're crying when we're upset," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, what do you think?"
She added, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager of a turkey, who said she was crying when she was upset, but found out that when she got angry and cried, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I was infuriated."
And then he continued.
I think that was good."
Tears come out as a way of letting go of anger because they need people so much.
One of my earliest memories of the first job, a office full of men, when I found myself crying because of an unexplainable anger, I was pulled by a scary necklace - an intrusive manager I was always afraid of - he pulled me out of the stairs.
"I've never seen you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've found you."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic woman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested for adultery on the Monkey Business ship and was ejected from the election, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, realized that he could not fulfill his desire to enter the presidential election.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are already seven others in the race, and a mockery awaits another.
They call it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was about to end, he did not have the money to campaign, so he vowed that he would not enter the race until he had <0x24>2 million.
It was a battle I could not have won.
He found that some of his supporters who gave <0x24>1,000 million to men could give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think I'm going to get a refund?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not make an organized campaign, he was emotionally frustrated - an appreciation of the people who have supported him, a frustration of the system that has made it difficult to mobilize funds and to find candidates instead of members, and anger at the discrimination against women - he has been stuck in it.
"You could think I was still in," recalled Mrs. Schroeder and how the media responded to her.
"You can imagine that Kleenex will be a coupon for the franchise.
I remember thinking, what would they put in my grave?
"Have you been here?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can be profitable in Beijing
The salvos opening trade war between the U.S. and China were shutting down, and as the war is far from over, the negotiations between these countries could be profitable for Beijing in the future, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year for importing goods to China including electric, steel and aluminum panels.
The biggest incident this week was with new <0x24>200 billion tariffs affecting items worth <0xC2><0xA3>150 billion, covering half of all U.S. imports from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time in the same way, recently placing five to ten percent of American goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has asked to be exactly the size of the U.S., and the world's second-largest economy has less chances of collapse soon.
"To make Washington downhill means to shut down the corner for its needs, but publicly bowing down to the U.S. can be very embarrassing to <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
However, researchers say that if Beijing acted wisely, the pressure of a US trade war could harvest China for a long time by reducing the cooperation between the two parties.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could cause economic problems in both countries is far more dangerous than what viewers have seen before," said Abigail Grace, a Asia-based researcher at the Center for New American Security, a psychologist.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild the war-torn country that lasted seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation is calm and safe because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to repair the areas that have been damaged by terrorists in order to restore normal life.
All situations now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they had to flee because of terrorism and the indiscriminate economic laws that plague their daily lives and the way of life.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Some 6 million people still live in this area need help with life’s necessities.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would enjoy the help of rebuilding a war-torn country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept material help or help from countries that supported the revolt.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the USA team by 16.5 - 10.5 points in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now been eaten six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe also won the award as Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to win the United States.
U.S. striker Phil Mickelson, who was hard-pressed throughout the race, put his tee-shot in the water in a par-3 hole of 16, his game was picked up by Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has played well in all of his tournaments, becoming one of 4 to 5-0-0 player since the format of the current tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of America was released in 5<0x26>4 by the lowest-level player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has been defeated 2 and 1 by England's Ian Poulter who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
The champion of the Ryder Cups, Spain Sergio Garcia won more times than anyone else in Europe with 25.5 points.
"I don't often cry, but today I can't control myself.
It would have been a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad we got it again.
We're working for the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He is transferring work to fellow John Ram who won the U.S. goalkeeper Tiger Woods by 2<0x26>1 on Sunday.
"I'm really proud of my victory over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 for the Ryder Cup.
Unusual figures are one of the most famous players in history, who have won 14 major titles to become only second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been hard-pressed all weekend to get the fairways apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played high-level golf throughout the entire competition.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team's poor performance, "I'm proud of our players, they've worked.
It was a very early morning in Europe.
We failed.
He worked for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 players have played very well.
We will prepare, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move on.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be a captain.
You should advise your captain.
We've been defeated."
Recent Red Tide: Prices drop in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a reduction in Red Tide numbers in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, product variances are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - which may indicate declining rates.
The Red Tide product grows about 130 miles off the coast from the north of Pinellas to the south of the Lee areas.
The difference is located about 10 miles from Hillsborough County's coastline, but in a few areas it was only a few weeks ago.
Red Tide has also appeared in Pasco County.
Statistics entering the area or from the coast of Pinellas County have been reported last week, low to high numbers from the shores of Hillsborough County, back to higher numbers in Manatee County, back to higher and lower levels in the middle and off coasts of Sarasota County, back to higher levels in the lower and lower levels of the county.
Breathing disorders continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier areas.
There were no reports of respiratory disturbances in Northwest Florida last week.
