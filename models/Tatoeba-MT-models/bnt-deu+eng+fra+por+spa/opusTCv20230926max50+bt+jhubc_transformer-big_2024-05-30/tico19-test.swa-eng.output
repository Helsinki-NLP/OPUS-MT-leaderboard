Increase in cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
Total cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) show targets in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK confirm that, at a different rate depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow rapidly in all countries.
According to the situation in Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of treatment and especially critical conditions.
On 31 December 2019, a group of unidentified pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, China's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the source of the disease as a new coronavirus that is currently known as a serious asthma disorder, the asthma acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80<0x25> of people with COVID-19 have a moderate condition, namely asthma-free or pneumonia-related infections and most of them recovered.
In 14<0x25> of cases, COVID-19 develops with the most severe condition requiring hopsital transplantation, while the remaining 6<0x25> are critical cases requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for patients infected with COVID-19 is 4<0x25>.
In this study, we assess the total number of COVID-19 cases in each of the European Union/EEE Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the UK (UK) and compare the situation in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries with the UK and the number in Italy from 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread to geographic areas and the issues of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are now following those of the country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a major disaster.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to a case definition according to the WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed visas were reported by France on January 24, 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK), where between 31 December 2019 with that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the total number and total number of COVID-19 cases
In the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the reported number of COVID-19 cases in every country around the world, obtained from any official sources such as the WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess current COVID-19 issues in the EU/EEA and the UK, in comparison to those in Italy.
As part of the transmission of existing COVID-19 cases, we calculated the total number of COVID-19 cases in the 14 days reduced, thus focusing on the original source of COVID-19, in each EU/EA and UK country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also submitted the total number of reported cases for each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to that for Italy for the period from 31 January–15 March 2020.
Current issues regarding COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK
Current issues in cases of COVID-19 cases in 14 days reduced in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Photo 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total number of COVID-19 cases began to rise on 21 February and increased further on 28 February 2020.
This was further driven by an increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but across the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom indicated issues of an increase in the overall COVID-19 cases (Supplementary Text).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that of Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It is noteworthy that, by 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of cases that could be compared to that of Italy in the previous 3 weeks or less.
Our findings show that the number of COVID-19 cases reported is increasing dramatically in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Issues observed in the overall COVID-19 incidents suggested that this large-scale pandemic is increasing at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is despite different countries being at different levels, different in how each public health meets the possibility of different visa definitions in the country and different procedures for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19, including people's testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described a situation where 10<0x25> of COVID-19 patients needed intensive treatment and news sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units were already full of hormones.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA rates of 6<0x25> and 1<0x25> of cases respectively (data has not been shown).
However, they should be collected in a special order to be used in conjunction with current investigative data that reflects the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a significant difference in the availability of intensive and average medical beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (sleeping beds for people in critical condition and an average treatment of 12.5 per 100,000 in 2010-11).
The structural conditions associated with the burden of medical care, with estimates of each EU/EEA country and the UK of COVID-19 cases of people hospitalized with a risk of <0x3E>90<0x25> of the excess capacity of existing beds to address people in critical circumstances, have been released in the sixth update of the emergency assessment of COVID-19.
Since the visas are currently included in some areas in the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and units to treat people in critical condition are usually in the area of special numbers, information about cases and beds for people in critical condition should be found in the Maya nominative units for a 2-digit rating (NUTS-2).
The current situation in Italy and the current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of treatment and especially the care of people in critical situations, such as those taking place in the affected areas of Italy.
As suggested in a recent ECDC speed risk assessment, a rapid, people-oriented approach is crucial in slowing the spread of SARS-COV-2, with changes from a regulatory perspective to a response, as the expected increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and put their strategies to deal with them.
A quick risk assessment also lists public health measures to cope with the impacts of the pandemic.
There is limited chances where countries are able to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on treatment.
Without doing so, there is a possibility that other EU/EEA health treatment systems will face an increase in patients needing intensive treatment within the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by serious asthma-related asthma complications (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and spread across the world, leading to a disaster.
Similar to similar viruses, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS among thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats causing similar symptoms through the same pathway.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but a higher risk of transmission and infecting older people than younger men and more women.
In dealing with the increasing number of publications on this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide timely reviews and a summary of this fast-growing research topic.
We will address basic issues regarding epidemiology, etiology, variology, diagnosis, treatment, its sources and disease prevention.
While there are still other questions that need to be answered, we hope this review will help to understand and eliminate this dreadful disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has been an unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were encouraged to stay home throughout the holiday season and for many weeks later due to a new outbreak of virus-borne disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe asthma acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020 and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COV-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being admitted home and more than 3,000 dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is "an enemy of the public number 1" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19 including variology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that identified a series of virus separations from most patients.
This review attempts to summarize research development in a new rapidly growing topic area.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS with other CoV-related illnesses, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and outbreaks in 2012.
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of the disease as well as some questions that have not yet been answered.
CoV has traditionally been considered to be a harmless virus in humans, which mainly causes about 15<0x25> of common 4 influenza.
However, in this century, we have encountered two of the most viral human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to many other countries with high levels of disease and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, collections of pneumonia whose origin was unknown were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission in China.
Seven days later, the CoV series was launched.
On 15 January 2020, the first worst case from Wuhani was reported.
At present, the epidemic spread rapidly in towns, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, infections among medical providers were reported, indicating that transmission from humans to humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was closed and public transport was suspended.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease was reported, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had directly contacted the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the area where the infection began from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak to be a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Photo.2).
As the situation continues to grow, the climax and the impact of the outbreak are not yet determined.
As of 11 February 2020, a study of 8,866 different centers of patients including 4,021 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 presented a more up-to-date picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-H<0x58><0x5F>rHP<0x58>a1qHA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus affected people of all ages, but most of those between the ages of 30-65.
About half (47.7<0x25>) of the infected population were over 50 years of age, few were under 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 affected more men (0.31/100,000) than (0.27/100,000).
Covid-19 has spread in and around the world.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (9 days) from the beginning of the study.
The average period of his invasion was 4.8 days (3.0–7.2).
The average period from his death to his death was 9.5 days (4.8–13).
The primary generation number (R0) was 3.77 (95<0x25> CI: 3.51–4.05), and the modified R0 was 2.23–4.82.
The number of infected people increased before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the time of mass transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for confirmed patients with cases was 1.44<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 1.10-1.86<0x25>), and the modified mortality rate for patients was 3.06<0x25> (95<0x25> CI: 2.02-4.59<0x25>).
The three main criteria for COVID-19 risk were sex (mother), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60), and poor pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and attached viruses with a single RNA sequence.
They can be divided into four types, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha- and beta forms of CoV are known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein binding binds to its angiotensin receptor cells 2 enzymes (ACE2) and dipeptdyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane connection occurs.
The viral RNA genome of the RNA is released in the saitoplasm; after the release of the virus genome, the genome RNA along with the glucoseprotons attached to the nucleacapsid proteins to form the viral bells, which are then attached to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98<0x25> generic identification among 10 tracked samples collected from the original area of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood market of Wuhani.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through an electronic distribution study, SARS-CoV-2 fragments were found in thinner portions of the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be a SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 protein binds to human ACE2 in a much weaker way than SARS-CoV, which is accompanied by the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an even worse infection rate in patients compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new short protein with the orf3b code and the protein produced with the orf8 code.
The orf3b structure of SARS-CoV-2 can take place in the viral state causing damage and prevent the emergence of IFN<0xCE><0xB2>; however, the orf8 does not have any known active domain.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues, reported the cryo-EM structure of the full human length ACE2 to be a 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> for complexity with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complexity, which had both open and binding bindings, was compiled as two molecules and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, giving evidence of diagnosis and CoV transmission.
B0AT1 can be a once-medical test for a drug to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Keeping an Eye on the Infectious Disease
It has been known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have origins from bats and were transmitted to humans through cats and camels, respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bats were considered to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers as the virus is 96<0x25> similar to SARS-like CoVs from bat-SL-CoVZ<0x58>45 and SL-CoVZ<0x58>21 bats.
However, the central carrier who helped the virus move human beings from the inhibition of this species is still unknown and its distribution method is not yet determined.
Ji and his colleagues, suggested snakes to be virus carriers from bats to humans which involved a re-introduction of the same protein in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that long-distance cocaine, termites that have traditionally been used as a Chinese medicine - are more likely to carry SARS-CoV-2 based on 99<0x25> of genetic homogy in CoV discovered inside the coconut and SARS-CoV-2.
However the 1<0x25> spread difference between the two genomes is still a significant difference; thus, the full results for solid evidence are still waiting (Photo 33).
The physiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live within measurable tubes for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days under 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40<0x25>-50<0x25> of humidity conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is largely affected by ultraviolet rays and temperatures of 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; ether, 75<0x25> ethanol, a cleaner containing chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively disable the virus.
Humans as a whole are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore are at risk of contracting the new virus.
At present, no in-depth research has reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Photo.).
Generally, after the virus invades the carrier, they are first identified by the immune system of the carriers through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) including the C-type receptors of lectin, Toll (TLR), NOD (NLR) bacteria, and RIG-II (R) viruses.
Through different methods, the virus causes the presence of elements that lead to the burning of tissue, the maturation of dendrite cells and the production of protein I interferons (IFNs) that control the spread of viruses and accelerate the production of antiviral proteins.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus evade the immune system’s edge.
In a short time, the immune system joins in the fight against the virus.
White T-cells including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> T-cells can play an important role in the immune system.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that deal with specific viruses and CD8<0x2B> T cells are directly infected by viruses.
T Helper cells produce satokine molecules that help burn to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cells' functioning by causing T cell death.
Human immune systems, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and various antibodies, are also important in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies given to a recovered patient destroyed MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, when the body’s immune system produces excessive antibodies it can cause serious lung and other organ damage, and in worse cases, many organ failures and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, which were initially exposed, are more likely to affect older people with other diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are at risk of getting a higher number of viruses or whose immune system is weaker, they have a higher chance of being infected by others.
The average incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 1–14 days, usually 3–7 days according to a study of 425 first cases in Wuhani.
However, studies on 1,099 cases show that the period of his seizure was 3 days on average and was between 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study as described above shows that the period of seizure was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine duration according to the more precise period of infection, thus preventing infected people who do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people who are at risk or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Is the duration of the quarantine to be extended to 24 days?
Excessive body temperature is the main and often preliminary symptom of COVID-19, which can be followed by the absence of symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty in breathing, muscle pain, chewing gum, headaches, headaches, throat shock, cold, chest pain, driving, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing and/or low levels of clean air in the body at the beginning of the disease.
In the worst case cases, patients continued to have severe respiratory problems, resulting in inactivity, excessive acidity and blood clot failure.
Patients with asthma and/or symptoms of asthma and high fever, even without respiratory problems should be tested for viruses in early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98<0x25> for fever, 76<0x25> for dry cough, 55<0x25> for respiratory difficulty and 3<0x25> for driving; 8<0x25> for patients who needed respiratory aid.
Similar results were reported in two recent family samples and the resulting sample by someone who did not show symptoms of the disease.
Comparatively, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98<0x25>), dry cough (47<0x25>) and difficulty breathing (55<0x25>) as their main symptoms.
However, 80<0x25> of them needed respiratory aids, more than COVID-19 patients and this corresponds to a more severe MERS condition than COVID-19.
Running (26<0x25>) and throat-cutting (21<0x25>) were also found among MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been found that high body temperature (99<0x25>-100<0x25>), dry cough (29<0x25>-75<0x25>), difficulty breathing (40<0x25>-42<0x25>), driving (20-25<0x25>) and throat cramps (13-25<0x25>) were the main symptoms and respiratory aid machines were needed for 14<0x25>-20<0x25> of patients.
As of 14 February, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2<0x25> while confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the death toll from SARS by November 2002 was 10<0x25> of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37<0x25> of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous research reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high at a rate of 6.47 with a 95<0x25> precision rate (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where R0 of SARS-CoV was only for 2 to 4 wavelengths.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to their symptoms, death rates and R0 has been shown in Table 1.1.
The above data show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but its edge is lower than the other two.
So there is a greater challenge to control the greater SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than to control MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
When it emerges at the beginning, it usually takes place in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle as a ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling or living in Wuhani or other affected areas or contacting people or patients who have been affected in the last two weeks prior to the start.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients who have been allowed to return home can carry the virus again, giving a quarantine warning.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of side white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the initial phase.
For example, deficiency of white blood cells <0x3C>4<0xC3><0x97>109/L including lymphocyte numbers <0x3C>1<0xC3><0x97>109/L and washed levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle and myoglobin enzymes increased in the blood of some patients with C-reactive protein and the cleaning of erythrocyte increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimensional level, the product of lowering fibrini in the blood, was elevated and the number of lymphocytes continued to decrease.
Unusual conditions in chest tests were found in many COVID-19 patients and these conditions included two-way shadows or pulmonary closures so that they could not be detected.
Patients often had abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injuries and severe respiratory problems called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of ARDS, uncontrolled burns, hydraulic accumulation and continuous vascular swelling are inconsistent with gas emissions.
The inactivity of type-I and type-II air cavities reduces the shock rates of the product in a dry state and increases the rates of local inflammation, thereby reducing the likelihood of the lungs expanding and setting a higher risk for inactivation of the lungs.
Therefore, the results of the most severe breast-feeding tests are consistent with the worse rate of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 signaled an attack on the inner lungs, the structure of hyaline dysfunction, the entry of lymphocytes in the body through pathogens and lymphocytes in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, in comparison to the pathology of SARS and ARS infections and similar.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through the reverse-transcriptase polymerase sequence (RT-PCR) was used as a baseline mechanism for COVID-19 testing.
However, due to the high rate of cases of the existing disease not being detected through tests, which can spread the pandemic, medical signs began to be used for testing (which is no longer limited to RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
The same thing happened with the SARS test.
Therefore, the overall history of the disease, clinical manifestations, experiments in laboratories and the results of radiology are important and suitable for performing effective tests.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described the process of using the SHERLOCK-based CRISPR method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10-18 mol/L ratios without the need for a minimum of 10-18 mol/L (copies 10-100 per millimeter of iron)
We hope that this new approach can significantly improve the relevance and convenience if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of new CoV experience, medical professionals can provide support therapy for COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have previously been used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table 2).
These treatments include modern and possible treatments and antiviral drugs, regional immune system, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, pharmaceutical and psychological support from China.
Even plasma from recovered patients was recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are struggling to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks heavily on the lungs at first and probably also attacks other organs that exhibit ACE2 though at low levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney system.
In addition, asthma and asthma inefficiency are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, breathing aid is essential to relieve pain and save lives and includes a regular clean air treatment, fresh air flow, helped to breathe without using a side machine and helped to breathe for a side machine depending on the condition of the disease.
Patients with acute asthma condition should be assisted through extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of cardiopulmonary deficiency or asthma pathway that is dangerous.
Also, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and inactivity of organs and the protection of vital organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is also known that satokine explosion is due to the immune system of patients to provide excess antibodies to fight SARS and MERS.
Satokine explosion is a systematic inflammatory reaction that involves the release of sytokine sequences including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3> and MCP-1.
These cytokines insert the immune cells to release a large number of free agents that are the main source of ARDS and frequency failure organs.
Immune suppression is essential in the treatment of a syphilis outbreak, especially in patients in critical condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a single-cylinder antibodies IL6, have been used to treat satokine explosions.
Other anti-inflammatory treatments for a satokinic explosion include the control of the immune system directed by a T cell; IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokine inhibition signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitions.
Steroids, or immune cells, were used extensively in the treatment of SARS to minimize the effects of burn damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially the lack of blood in the bones that significantly affected the diagnosis of the disease.
Despite this, small doses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids have been recommended to be used appropriately to treat patients in severe COVID-19 conditions.
At the time of writing an article, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, the injection of remdesivir, a nucleotide containing sugar and phosphate, has been found to be effective in a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of the Ebola virus and Marlburg virus.
Subsequently, remdesivir also showed prevention of the possibility of other common RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
On these grounds, Gilead has provided the drug to China to conduct a pair of tests for people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and events are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-<0xCE><0xB1>, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as possible treatments for patients with symptoms of severe respiratory problems.
Driving, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse conditions may occur following total treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these and other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients with the production of antibodies
The collection of blood from patients who recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthcare workers from illness has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have higher levels of antibodies compared to pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign substances and recognize specific molecules on the pathogens and fight them directly.
Due to this, plasma collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was used to incubate 10 patients in critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, including a decrease in inflammation and viral levels and improved with fresh air in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to suggest the method of use of large doses before specific treatments are created.
Also, when medical effects are highlighted, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate the body's immune system to pass revenge and cause serotonin to be produced, which is likely to have life-threatening impurities.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is low and the need for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to create and produce specific antibodies faster to combat the global pandemic.
It is therefore more important to extract B cells from recovered patients and to identify generic codes that diagnose effective antibodies or investigate the search for effective antibodies against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has also been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for many years.
However, its effects are largely based on the inclusion of many compounds in a variable formula based on the diagnosis of the disease according to TCM theories.
Many of the most effective buildings are still unknown or not specified as it is difficult to recover and verify such structures or their excellent integration.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from the worst stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing tablets were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
High rates of treatment in COVID-19 patients were observed in many regions in China that used TCM to treat 87<0x25> of their patients, including Gansu (63.7<0x25>), Ningxia (50<0x25>) and Hunan (50<0x25>), while the Hubei region, where TCM used only about 30<0x25> of their COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate for treatment.
However, this is a superficial comparison because other impact criteria such as the number and condition of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a comparative study of Western medicine (WM) alone and total WM and TCM treatments.
They found that the time required for restoring body temperature, symptom loss and hospitalization was significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM alone.
The best result is that the rates of condition in patients with symptomatic symptoms (from poorer to worse) decreased significantly in the WM<0x2B>TCM group than in the WM Group alone (7.4<0x25> versus 46.2<0x25>) and mortality rates decreased in the WM<0x2B>TCM group only (8.8<0x25> versus 39<0x25>).
Despite this, the effectiveness and safety of TCM is still waiting for the best-controlled experiments at larger levels and in many more stations.
It would be interesting to give qualifications to action procedures and to expose the effective TCM treatment structures or their integration if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often experience a severe fear of this highly infectious disease and even kill people, and people in quarantine also suffer from fatigue, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as high temperatures, a lack of sufficient clean air to the body organs and toxins as well as serious medical side effects such as sleep deprivation caused by medications that reduce inflammation can cause anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, various mental disorders including extreme stress, anxiety, panic attacks, mental excitement, symptoms of mental distress, and even suicide attempts were reported.
Monitoring people who have been affected by mandatory quarantine, as part of a public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may raise additional concerns and toxicity about the impact of infections, quarantine and stigma on family and friends.
Thus, mental health treatment should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected people and contacted persons as well as to the general public in need.
Psychiatric support should be included in the creation of various psychiatric health teams, open communications and regular reports that are accurate about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and programs to avoid contact with others.
Successful vaccines are essential in interrupting the supply chain from infected animals and humans to vulnerable people and are used together with antiviral treatment in controlling the large-scale outbreaks caused by the outbreak of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein vaccines to produce stable and long-lasting antibodies and/or body immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines from severed viruses have been evaluated in animal structures for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people and the structures of their rates to kill the virus and protection against animal-borne viruses is not yet determined before medical research is started.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new infections have been reported since.
Comparatively, cases and concentrations of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to animal sources in areas that witness the spread of the disease.
The vaccine strategies are designed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, virus currents, small particles, virus-like particles and reconnected protein units and others have been evaluated in animal structures.
The creation of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in immune-resistant people is an urgent and vital responsibility to control this ongoing pandemic.
However, there is a challenge to overcome this difficulty due to the long duration required (at an average of 18 months) to create the variants and variables of CoV.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to fully clinically manifest itself to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without the condition caused by a previous illness.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high risk of infection and mortality rates in patients with severe conditions.
Therefore, promoting a structure based on medical experience for the disease is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to a medical study reported so far, these criteria may affect or be associated with the condition of the COVID-19 presence in patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was an important criterion in the diagnosis of SARS, which is also a fact in COVID-19.
COVID-19 was mostly common in people aged 30-65 with 47.7<0x25> of the patients with more than 50 in the study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have other conditions of illness and complications and were older than those who did not (at an average age of 66 versus 51) and marked age as a criteria for COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Diseases and pre-existing health conditions: Patients with COVID-19 who needed treatment are more likely to have a severe heart attack and heart attack.
Cardiovascular events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive biological bonding cells, which can lead to inactivity in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and chronic diseases have strong relationships and can be interconnected.
Unusual laboratory results. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the condition of burns or tissue injuries and has been recommended as a criterion for recovery, treatment and ultimate healing.
The relationship between CRP levels and weight and recovery capacity from COVID-19 has also been suggested.
Also, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the results.
These enzymes are one in many parts of the body, especially in the heart and the liver and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are the traditional signs of heart failure or liver failure.
Main clinical symptoms: Breast diagnosis and temporary development of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for the forecast of results and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: Defined above, steroids are immune-resistant supplements that are widely used as an alternative treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the level of burn damage.
Since high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs were widely used in SARS patients, many of the victims suffered from lack of blood in the bone marrow and long-term disability and poor living conditions.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used for low doses and for a short period of time for COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from unusual stress as they endured long periods of quarantine and enthusiasm and saw the deaths of close family members and other patients.
It is important to provide physiological advice and long-term support to help patients recover from stress and refer to normal living conditions.
According to demographic research so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to being produced in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be produced in the upper part of the respiratory tract effectively resulting in moderate symptoms or not showing any symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoV viruses that cause severe fever.
Thus, patients infected in the early stages or period of seizures can produce significant amounts of the virus during day-to-day activities, resulting in greater difficulty in disaster control.
However, SARS-CoV distribution was considered to be carried out when patients are seriously ill, although most of the distribution did not take place in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is worse and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are currently underway in China, including the closure of regular operations in Wuhan and nearby cities and further quarantines for almost everyone in the hopes of stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been detrimental to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing and signaling a decline in the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of its impact on him will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated that COVID-19, which is essentially more likely to be infected with SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and his colleagues developed a system to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in airstream and throat tests of recovered patients and from the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that newly identified viruses could be of recurring periods such as flu.
However, signs of hope have emerged in China on the basis of a reduction in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola has been predicted to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and quarantine regulations, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 can be weakened in infections and eventually die or have a low level of infectious viruses and be available among humans.
Comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with that of SARS and MERS is shown below (photo.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mostly transmitted through coughing or sneezing and can also be transmitted through direct contact with virus contaminated devices.
The virus was also found in the excretion, which raises the possibility of new transmission from the excrement to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41<0x25> of cases were caused by infections within hospitals, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical providers.
Therefore, great care should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare providers, community workers, family members, co-workers and even other people who touch the sick or infected people.
The first defensive action that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing face-to-face blessings; using medical masks and N95 asthma-supporting masks (<0x23>1860 versions) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Medical surface masks prevent hydraulic droplets from a potentially infected person from being transported in the air or stuck to parts of the product, where they can be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (<0x23>1860 versions) can protect against breathing in microorganisms even at 10 to 80 nm, with 5<0x25> of the virus being fully transmitted; SARS-CoV-2 is equivalent to SARS-CoV in size and is about 85 nm.
Since small pieces can penetrate even five masks put together, healthcare providers that interact with patients must wear N95 masks (<0x23>1860 versions) but are not medical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear scarves containing the necessary components in order to avoid further contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect people through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore a mask of N95; the virus may have entered his body through his eyelids.
Thus, healthcare providers should also wear face masks or glasses while caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or vulnerable areas, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more cleaning soap than usual, try to stay at home with personal quarantine and minimize contact with people who may have been infected.
Three meters is considered a good distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its very similarity to SARS-CoV as retrieved on 7 January 2020 would have had to give China much attention due to their memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control consoled the public by saying that the new virus has low infection rates and low reproductive capacity and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
This message greatly reduced public concern, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they failed to cope with the disease when it was not more widespread in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can regret this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be (1) more careful when making public ads because each word means to the public and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more careful and take into account the irregular information from the clinic than to wait to receive official reports from doctors or officials; (3) set more restrictions to limit the possibility of disasters in its early stages to try to improve the public's time of crisis than to try to comfort the public and (4) be more proactive to provide more thorough experiments.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world as of now when we write.
Since these viruses are very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the concept of a resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some basic differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the pandemic and treating patients.
Covid-19 affects older people and men more than women and their weight and mortality rates are higher among older people than younger people.
SARS causes deaths at a higher percentage than COVID-19 (10.91<0x25> versus 1.44<0x25>).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they do not show any symptoms while SARS patients do so in extreme conditions, making it more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and in a wider area than SARS-CoV.
A normal RNA test of SARS-CoV-2 may occur negatively in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who have been treated can be recovered from the virus.
This increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Due to the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, many important issues remain unsolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus come from?
Although a 96<0x25> genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats-based SARS-CoVs, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originates from bats.
Which animal was centrally responsible for carrying and transmitting viruses from a native virus carrier, for example from bats to humans?
Without understanding the answers to the questions <0x23>1 and 2, we cannot effectively terminate the distribution and this outbreak can occur again at any time.
Although molecular structures and biochemical experiments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, what are the main parasites that this virus enters into the respiratory cells and causes subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also connecting the cells that show ACE2-in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we will not be able to achieve fast and accurate testing and effective treatment.
How long will this tragedy last?
How does the virus develop genetically at the time of transmission from humans?
Are you going to be a global pandemic, will you die like SARS or re-emerge over time such as influenza?
It's important, but you can take time to find the answers to the above questions and many more.
However, despite the cost, we must simply stop the pandemic as soon as possible and restore life to normal.
The origins of the human coronavirus
Physical changes and adaptive conditions have contributed to the growth of coronaviruses (CoVs) and its carriers, including humans for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild infections, such as common fever.
The outbreaks of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed things and demonstrated how HCoV infection can be dangerous and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoVs re-evaluated and surprised us with its high chances of transmission but reduced the risk of infection compared to similar SARS-CoV.
HCoV infections are animal-based and understanding the origins of HCoV infections from animals can help us.
Most HCoV viruses came from bats where they were unable to cause disease.
Some HCoV carriers are also known.
Identifying an animal carrier is directly involved in preventing human diseases.
Analyzing the interactions of CoV carriers in animals can also be of great help to gain valuable insight into CoV's potential to cause disease among humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge of seven types of HCoV, by focusing on the history of its discovery as well as its origin in animals and its transmission from one species to another.
Most importantly, we compare and differentiate different types of HCoV from the perspective of viral reversal to the replication of the genome.
The current COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) has been discussed in this context.
Also, the requirements for success with the flexibility of the carrier and the impact of viral growth on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) comes from the family Coronaviridae, consisting of a group of connected, positive, and single-cell RNA viruses.
These viruses with a density of 26 to 32 kilograms of RNA were called "CoVs" due to their crown-shaped shape under electronic surveillance.
Structurally, CoVs have a genome that does not have the same sequence of components.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large open-linked ORF1a and ORF1b frames, which convert to PP1a and pp1ab replication polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structured proteins, structured as nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs of structured proteins, including spikes (S), envelope (E), membéni (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
A number of specific generation proteins have been engraved by different generations of CoV.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among them, the beta-CoV genera contain the most HCoV virus and are divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Filogenetic evidence has shown that bats and bats serve as sources of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, with birds being the main hosts of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have gone beyond the restriction of species, and others have emerged as the main causes of human genital herpes.
To date, there are seven types of human CoV (HCoV) viruses.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other types of beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of high risk respiratory syndrome, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 often cause moderate symptoms, such as common flu and/or driving.
Alternatively, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are pathogenic pathogens with higher risk of infection in low respiratory tract infections in patients with higher probability of developing severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and out-of-pocket disorders.
The first type of HCoV-229E, B814, was extracted from liquids from the nostrils of patients with common flu in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through in-depth research on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause symptoms of personal weakness.
In fact, the concept had been accepted among many that the overall transmission of HCoV was harmless until the SARS outbreak occurred.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the worst outbreaks in modern history, affecting more than 8,000 people with a fatality rate of about 10<0x25>.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula as it spread to other parts of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV virus (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people by 3 March 2020.
Warnings have existed and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoV viruses are native to bats, rats or domestic animals.
A lot of evidence supports the nature of the growth of all HCoV viruses from bats, where viruses are common and are not capable of causing diseases but show a wide range of genetic conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented serious medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges in China and around the world.
Monitoring the source of HCoV from animals provides a process for understanding the natural history, motivation and parameters of disease prevention spreading between species.
This can also lead or facilitate the search for asylum, medium-sized carriers and animals that transmit SARS-CoV-2, with the effect of preventing overcrowding in the future.
In this review we present a summary of animal origin, distribution among species and the ability of HCoV to cause diseases.
In particular, we focus on and discuss the common theme that HCoV-producers usually do not have the ability to cause disease within their natural carriers but are capable of causing disease after transmission between species to a new carrier.
We are also reviewing the current issues of HCoV growth where the increase in infectious ability is often accompanied by a decrease in the ability to cause disease.
The effects of the ongoing outbreak of SAR-CoV-2 have also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoV virus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the release of the first HCoV-229E type B814 from the nasal fluids of patients with severe fever, various CoV viruses have been transmitted to various infected animals, including rodents, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoV viruses have been identified.
A summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in a timetable (Table 1) can be informative and direct.
The first type of HCoV-229E was released through breathing in patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, and later continued to develop in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of common fever, including headaches, sneezing, fatigue and swelling throats, with high temperatures and cough visible in cases 10<0x7E>20<0x25>.
Subsequently in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was extracted from organ transplantation and inhibition in the brains of suckling mice.
The medical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are considered to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be distinguished by those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses have spread all over the world, and appear to be more widespread during the winter season in moderate weather conditions.
Generally, the time between infection and the outbreak of the virus is less than a week and followed by a disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a human-dedicated study, health workers infected with HCoV-229E had a common cold.
Only a few patients whose immune system is weak showed severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS virus, also known as "unusual pneumonia", was the first HCoV epidemic in human history to be well documented and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV virus to be discovered.
The first SARS case can be monitored until the end of 2002 in China's Gaungdong Province.
The SARS pandemic resulted in 8,096 reported deaths and 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
In addition to the main causes, it was estimated that each case would trigger approximately two seconds of the period between infection and a 4-7-day surge and the maximum viral rate seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show signs of muscle pain, headaches, extreme heat, fatigue and cold, then respiratory problems, cough and respiratory problems as future symptoms.
Decline of lymphosate cells in the blood, an examination of damaged liver function, and an increase in chromosome kinase is an abnormal SARS diagnosis.
Alveola degradation, increased epithelial cells and increased macrofeji are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30<0x25> of patients later require in-depth treatment with respiratory aids.
Along with the lower respiratory pathway, many organs including gastrointestinal, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these adverse cases, usually accompanied by a satokine outbreak, which can be particularly dangerous for patients whose immune system has been affected.
The virus was first extracted from a pulmonary surgeon who travelled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
Since then, serious efforts have been put into the study of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was released from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to spread among young children, elderly people and patients whose immune system was affected with respiratory diseases.
The appearance of influenza, conjactivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal samples from a 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although recognized in the Netherlands, they spread throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for 4.7<0x25> of common respiratory diseases and occurs mostly during the early summer, autumn and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 virus is associated with a cavity-resistant cavity, also known as a cavity.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was extracted from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and a pulmonary blockage in Hong Kong.
In addition to socially transmitted pneumonia and air-conditioning in the lungs, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with a sharp increase in asthma binding.
Virus similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide leading to asthma-related diseases.
All of these socially transmitted HCoVs have found a way to stay within humans better and are less likely to evolve to cause viral infections, although accidents occurred for unknown reasons as in rare cases of a small strain of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe respiratory infections in China.
Generally speaking, the HCoV has gained the ability to effectively transmit and maintain itself in humans, as well as their viral or pathogenic potential is decreasing.
MERS-CoV was first released in 2012 from a 60-year-old pulmonary patient who suffered severe pneumonia and shortness of breath in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed cases in laboratories occurred in the Middle East, cases from foreign countries that were frequently spread to people who were close to them have been reported in Europe and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Medical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, with a characteristic of a persistent high pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced urinary failure, which is very unique to MERS among HCoV-related diseases.
More than 30<0x25> of patients show symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders, such as driving and transplantation.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases in laboratories were reported with high mortality rates by 34.4<0x25>, making MERS-CoV one of the worst known human viruses.
In mid-December 2019, a collection of pneumonia patients previously known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared an ongoing outbreak of low respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Global Public Health Emergency of Concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with an alarming death rate of 3.4<0x25>.
The mortality rate in Hubei Province, China, is 4.2<0x25>, while outside the region is 1.2<0x25>.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized as high temperature, cough and respiratory difficulty.
It is also common for some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can continue to grow rapidly and become a severe respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related due to a high-quality nuclear chain of 82<0x25>, they combine to be different branches in a philogenetic diagram.
It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is less prone to disease but its distribution is higher compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People who do not show symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other types of HCoV has generated very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the period between infection and emergence and the period of the presence of HCoV is the same.
As a result, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common swelling of other HCoV viruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and four HCoV viruses that are socially transmitted (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections show characteristics that are usually observed during the transmission of HCoV socially infectious viruses, including showing unspecific symptoms, amounts or even absences of any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infections, although tests are much lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 distribution also reflects an interesting pattern of HCoV distributed collectively by SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission is at least as high as that of socially transmitted HCoV.
On the other hand, it will remain valid if the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases after human transmission as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Finally, like other HCoV viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the excretion sample.
If the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through excretion through the mouth plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain conditions remains exposed through future research.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can occur during seasons as in the cases of socially transmitted HCoVs.
Despite this, the components of SARS-CoV-2 including the ability to transmit, transmit and continue transmission after human transmission will have an influence on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four socially transmitted HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms have become common in humans.
In another view, it may also be the fact that humans are familiar with these four HCoV viruses.
In other words, they may all be survivors of previous HCoV disasters.
HCoV viruses that cause severe diseases in humans and humans with severe HCoV infections have been eliminated.
In this case, HCoV must be produced in humans to the fullest extent to allow for the accumulation of changes that can combat the control criteria of the virus carrier.
In this sense, the more the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the more people are infected, the more likely it will be to be exposed to humans.
If the virus is not properly detected, its spread to humans can be difficult to control through quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
Over the years, four socially transmitted CoVs have spread among people, triggering common colds among people/animals with a strong immune system.
The virus does not need to be injected into the animal.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the most widely transmitted viruses are not well-regulated in humans and its spread among humans cannot be controlled.
They need to maintain and maintain their reserves within animals and find a place to spread to targeted humans at risk, perhaps through a secondary and spreading container.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same characteristics as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four socially transmitted HCoVs.
They are more likely to be transmitted such as socially transmitted HCoVs, at least for the moment.
However, it causes more disease than the socially transmitted HCoV virus and its potential to cause disease is lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether they will be fully adapted to humans and spread into humans without protection or animal carriers.
Before discussing the origins of HCoV, it would be a good idea for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the growth carrier, nature, storage and transmission of HCoV.
An animal acts as a developmental HCoV carrier if it has maintained a close relative similarity to the nucleotide sequence level.
Genetic viruses are usually infectious and do not have the ability to cause disease within the carrier.
Also, the hosting carrier has HCoV on a regular and long-term basis.
In all cases, the virus carriers are transmitted naturally and are the natural HCoV carriers or their generational viruses.
On the contrary, if the HCoV virus has first penetrated into the central carrier before or near its human invasion, it is not well adapted to the new environment and often leads to disease.
This medium can be used as a source of animal transmission to humans and performs the responsibility of the transmitter by allowing the virus to be produced and then transmitted to humans in order to increase the rate of transmission to humans.
HCoV viruses can pass through non-infectious infections if they are unable to maintain their transmission within the central carrier.
On the other hand, HCoV can also be transmitted within its central carrier and even create a state of long-term illness.
In this case, the central carrier becomes a natural carrier that protects the virus.
An epological data revealing in a backdrop that the SARS case had a history of contact with wildlife.
Subsequent study of the rate of infection indicated that animal traders had a higher level of anti-SARS-CoV igG compared to the total population.
The mascot-faced turtles (Paguma larvata) and rakuni dogs in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported after the killing of all the doves on the market.
However, it has been reported that dolphins with a face mask from wild or rural areas without contact with animals sold in the market were mostly not found to be SARS-CoV, indicating that hybrid-faced dolphins can only serve as central transmission carriers but not natural SARS-CoV.
It will be noted that, since 80<0x25> of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the likelihood that many species of small mammals can also be used as intermediate transmission carriers of SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
All of these appear to be non-invasive carriers of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent animal research that is a natural SARS-CoV carrier showed that the CoV virus closely related to bats, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), is found within the Chinese horsehoe bat.
These bats have antibodies against SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other CoV bats contain 88-92<0x25> similar nucleotides with SARS-CoV.
This study has laid the foundation for a new theory that bats carry the emerging human virus.
Several Cov viruses (SL-CoVs) similar to SARS have also been identified in bats, but none of them except WIV1 can be isolated as living viruses.
The human hormone responsible for blood pressure converting 2 enzymes (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 virus extracted from the bat excretion sample was shown to use bats, human rodents and ACE2 as a receptor to enter the cell.
Surprisingly, serums from SARS recovering patients were able to destroy WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest generation of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95<0x25> of the same nucleotide sequence.
In great similarities between the virus, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a central SARS-CoV-producer and bats are not the centralized SARS-CoV carriers.
Phenogenetic analysis combines MERS-CoV to the same group as the CoV-HKU4 virus of bats and the CoV-HKU5 virus of bats.
The CoV-HKU4 virus of bats and MERS-CoVs use the same carrier receptors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent polymerization of MERS-CoV RNA is almost identical to the phylogenetic and contained in the beta-CoV virus of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no active MERS-COV virus can be found within wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest species of bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87<0x25> of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be central carriers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies conducted in the Middle East have shown that taller camels have specific antibodies to balance MERS-CoV, similar to those of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The active MERS-CoV virus similar to the virus found in humans was extracted from nasal samples from longer camels, further indicating that camels can be used as true MERS-CoV carriers.
It is also important to keep in mind that generally mild but highly-delivered symptoms were generally observed in MERS-CoV-infected camels for experiments.
Clearly, infected camels produce viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through excretion, which is also a major means of transmitting the virus from bats.
However, questions remain unanswered as most cases of confirmed MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms begin, and significantly mark human transmission to humans or undisclosed transmission methods involving unidentified species carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2<0x25> nucleotides similar to CoV RaTG13 of bats released from Rhinolophus affinis native bats.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so large that they cannot be placed on a parental link.
That is to say, bats may not be close carriers of SARS-CoV-2 hosts unless close-up bat CoVs are to be found in the future.
It can be assumed that, a central animal carrier of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the species of wild animals sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood General Market, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 were involved, indicating the possibility of an event of transmission from an animal to human.
Many recent studies focusing on metagenomic sequences have indicated that a group of endangered young mammals known as cocaine (Manis javanica) can carry the traditional beta-CoV virus associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These CoV genomes from brother-in-law contain 85-92<0x25> of the nucleotide homology sequence similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, they are also closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90<0x25> of the identification at the nucleotide sequence level.
It is classified into two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2 identical to SARS-CoV-2 viruses in a philogenetic diagram, one of which if it shares the same domain as the RBD receptor (RBD) equivalent to SARS-CoV-2, containing 97.4<0x25> of the amino acid diagnosis sequence.
In a clear comparison, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 viruses are quite different, although the maximum width of the same genome sequence.
Early research on the infected cocaine also reported the discovery of the virus in kidney samples that, in turn, appeared to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different methods of collecting and repairing to produce a half sequence of 86.3<0x25> of the total length of the virus genome.
We cannot freeze the possibility that it saw you as one of the central carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a result of the sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 found in cocaine.
The pathway of growth of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, mammals and other mammals remains unidentified.
Although the highest similarity of the sequence has been found in RBD between beta-CoV related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 found in cocaine, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have a higher similarity of the genome sequence.
It is widely believed that the high level of similarity between the RBDs of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 viruses found in cocaine and SARS-CoV-2 is led by the accumulation growth generated on the basis of selection.
The anti-inflammatory proposal supports re-introduction of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 viruses found in crabs and RaTG13 in the third type of wildlife.
As a stimulant in growth, recombination has spread among beta-CoV viruses.
The decision has not yet been reached regarding the immediate origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
In addition to the high probability of HCoV causing diseases, the origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from animals have also been studied.
Filogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E viruses may have originated from bat-CoV, with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses being found within the mouse community.
It has been reported that bat CoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) discovered in North America three-colored bats showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to other bat CoV virus, known as Hipposideros/GhanaKam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, with smaller camel species also suspected of being its central carrier.
Clearly, the current knowledge of the origins of the known HCoV animal has been summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
A philosophical analysis has provided evidence of HCoV distribution events between species in history.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus spread among animals and infected humans from animals around 1890, asthma epidemics were witnessed.
The history of the transmission of HCoV-229E is not specified.
The alpha-CoV virus of bats closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them is the alpha-CoV found in alpaca, a species of animal.
Several lines of evidence support the direct transmission of viruses from bats to humans.
First, humans and not alpacas who are animals may have had contact with bats in an ecologically engaged environment.
Instead, humans are closely connected to alpacas that are animals.
Second, the alpha-CoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are distinct and have no potential to cause disease within bats, whereas the alpha-CoV found in alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV found in alpaca has not been found in wildlife.
Thus, the possibility of alpaca getting alpha-CoV-related HCoV-229E virus from humans cannot be blocked out.
Indeed, bats are the direct source of disease-causing viruses in humans including dog-borne viruses, Ebola viruses, Nipah viruses and Hendra viruses.
So it is not surprising that bats have the ability to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, although alpha-CoV is used as a gene domain for HCoV-229E, alpaca and longer camels are likely to serve as intermediate virus carriers that transmit viruses to humans, mostly in the MERS-CoV state.
MERS-CoV is used as an excellent example of transmission between animals from bats to long-distance camels and from long-distance camels to humans.
The nature of MERS-CoV's growth from bats is known in its first diagnosis and has also been confirmed by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a large collection of virus species for the exchange between animals of genetic components and the distribution between animals.
The ability to live longer, the habitat with many animals, the close social interactions and the strong flying ability are conditions that make bats a 'virus-disposable animal'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in long camels for decades.
They are well-acquainted within these camels who have evolved from central virus carriers to stable and natural protective carriers of the virus.
MERS-CoV causes very little disease and maintains a lower level of flexibility compared to these animals.
Its immediate distribution to humans is accidental and humans remain the last infectious carriers of MERS-CoV because its transmission is not permanent.
On the contrary, the role of camels in the distribution of MERS-CoV, the role of cocaine, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 distribution is different.
In particular, beta-CoVs found in coconuts are highly susceptible to disease within the cocaine.
They may be the bearers of beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 non-infectious viruses, similar to dolphins in SARS-CoV-like conditions.
Several chances of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between organisms from animals to humans must be acceptable or rejected in future studies.
First of all, bats can be carriers of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses close to being similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological environment with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, cannabis may be one of the centralized transmission carriers who have contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the first time.
Humans get the virus by killing and eating wild animals.
Most mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to get SARS-CoV-2.
A study of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is worth it.
Third, as mentioned above, re-incorporation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third organism that was attached to bats and mouse.
The search for the SARS-CoV-2 seal from animals is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of carrier animals, the three main parameters on the viral side are also important in enabling CoVs to be transmitted to organisms.
First of all, their high levels of flexibility in RNA production.
Compared to other single RNA viruses, the estimated levels of CoV mutation can be considered "moderate" or "high" with the average exchange rate being <0x7E>10-4 per year for each 2 zone, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to its new carrier.
CoVs have an exoribonucleic acid, whose suppression leads to an increase in flexibility, decreased impact or even its ability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to reduce the production of CoV through the inhibition of exoribonucleic acid and RNA polymeris based on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines under clinical trials.
Despite this, the rates of CoV conversion are about a million times higher than those of its carriers.
Also, the rates of change are often higher when CoVs are not common in the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high flexibility rates, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rates are clearly low, indicating a higher probability of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that they are already familiar with another human carrier.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, a virus that is well-acquainted within longer camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic mutations can make vaccines and antiviral drugs faster suited to SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the larger RNA genome on the CoVs is more capable of flexibility in genome modification for mutation and replication, thereby increasing the possibility of joint growth among organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs as conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by specific frequency frequency frames and the function of proteins engraved towards the end of 3 of the genome.
Third, CoV randomly and occasionally changes the prototype during RNA production through a special "copy-choice" process.
Within the virus carrier that serves as a mixer, strandi mutations occur frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
More similar RNAs of full-length and smaller genomes can reassemble to produce new COVs.
The physiological evidence of natural replication has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as CoV viruses found in animals such as bat SL-CoV viruses and bat CoV-HKU9 viruses.
The interaction of the virus carrier with the distribution
In addition to the three parameters of the above-mentioned virus, the interaction of the carrier's viruses is another important influencer in the distribution of organisms.
Here, the re-incorporation of SARS-CoV is considered to be a common pattern, which also showed evidence of positive selection during organism distribution events.
Based on comparative analysis of SARS-CoV in humans and dolphins, SARS-CoV is thought to be quickly adapted to different carriers, especially for changes in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, RBD on the CoV protein interacts with the cell receptor and is selected in detail by the carrier's antibodies response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318 and 510 amino acids in the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as the main receptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, dolphins, rats and dogs, and allows the transmission of viruses between organisms.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be distinct from viruses isolated from humans and pigeon on RBD and 4 of them are located in the replication of receptors for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoVs in the Ngawa have the mutations of K479N and S487T on their RBD, which can increase the likelihood of S protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the conversion of these two amino acids can be crucial in the virus adaptation of humans.
It is important to remember that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptors as SARS-CoV.
The 30<0x25> difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV on the S1 unit of the S protein suggests that the ability of S protein to bind to human ACE2 may have been altered.
Of course, cryo-EM research suggests a probability of 10- to 20-more of this viscosity than between the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would be interesting to see if any potential vaccines could be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but to a different S component.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptides N of HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-acetylated glucose acid of HCoV-OC43.
They can also lead to the effectiveness of the CoV in humans after it is transmitted between organisms from their carriers.
In addition to cell receptors, the effect of HCoV distribution between organisms is also controlled by dependency with other carriers and preventive parameters.
The differences between these animal carrier proteins between humans and the native carriers of HCoV hosts such as bats, taller camels and rodents may be a barrier to the distribution of organisms.
HCoV must invade the dependencies of the virus carrier and replace the inhibitors of the virus carrier in order to successfully transmit the virus among the organisms.
For these specifications, the molecular specifications in this important part of the interaction between the virus and its carrier are yet to be identified and classified.
A comprehensive inspection of the detergent based on SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors using CRISPR technology may be fruitful.
The emergence of a new HCoV virus: completely reversed
A variety of bat CoV offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a collection of various HCoV genes.
In addition, rapid flexibility and genetic integration also facilitates the growth of HCoV and becomes two important stages in this process.
For example, finding or losing a new protein-binding gene is likely to quickly change the viral sample.
Among SARS-CoV access proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in human practice, as bat-related SARS-CoVs were released but were found to bind to different ORF8 proteins.
The nucleotide detection of 29 SARS-CoV has been found in samples isolated at the beginning of the human disaster.
This filter divides the ORF8a into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be adaptive changes that facilitate the conversion of virus carriers.
Also, SARS-CoV is likely to have a history of integration with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of subunits of subunited RNA-based polymers were identified.
Combination zones were also identified in nsp9, multiple nsp10 and components of nsp14.
It has also been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic witnessed intergenerational integration events, which occurred in Saudi Arabia's tallest camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-incorporated cases of another HCoV have also been observed, in which various HCoVs are reconnected with other animal CoV viruses in their non-structured genes.
Warnings should also be kept in mind that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in virus genome, often due to the removal of selective viruses, such as the immune system of the virus carrier.
An example of these effects is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the original sample of HCoV-229E, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 is stable with the possibility of exposure to viruses found in bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV found in alpaca showed the placing of one nucleotide, causing a reversal of the frame.
Finally, the growth of the new HCoV virus is also due to the selection pressure on the virus carrier's storage.
Lack of symptoms or moderate symptoms was detected when bats were infected with CoV, signaling a joint adaptation between CoV and bats.
It was found that CoVs were well adapted to bats in structure and body function.
For example, errors in response to burns within bats have been effective in reducing the potential of CoV-enabled disease-causing infections.
Also, the activity of the natural killer cell in bats has been delayed due to the production of natural killer cell receptors for NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of type I molecules for the synthesis of tissues.
In addition, high levels of active oxygen (ROS) produced as a result of high activity in bats can slow down CoV receptors and affect the review of Exoribonucleics, thereby providing a selection pressure for the production of viral strains that have the greatest potential to cause disease when introduced into a new environment.
Further CoV-induced samples may develop through re-introduction, resulting in the availability of new proteins or protein characteristics for adaptation to the carrier.
Thus, it is not unfortunate that three new HCoV viruses have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs have no ability to cause disease or cause moderate symptoms in their carriers such as bats and camels.
It is produced in large quantities without showing strong immune responses to the body of its carrier.
Here's a secret about why non-symptom-resistant virus carriers are found and what causes severe cases in human infections.
Symptoms are often the result of excessive immune response to hyperactivity and a sytokine explosion where the immune system is more stable, the lungs are more damaged.
On the other hand, in unintended carriers, the immune response is separated from the production of CoV.
A similar strategy for separating the immune response can be beneficial in treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The effect of proteins produced by the virus carrier is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the release of proteins supplied by the I-type virus carrier at least in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome on bats is harmful.
For this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome using MCC950 may be necessary in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a general pattern where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
Although bat beta-CoVs with 95<0x25> nucleotide similarities with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also a bat-CoV with 96<0x25> nucleotide similarities with SARS-CoV-2.
Although hybrids and other animals on the market have been found to contain SARS-CoV-like viruses, close-up SARS-CoV-2 carriers have not been identified.
Beta-CoVs found to be very similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that crabs may be central carriers or beta-CoVs found in cocaine may contribute gene fragments to the final form of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is deliberately man-made.
CoVs have been reintroduced as a result of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Research of CoV in bats and other animals has rapidly changed our attitudes about the importance of animal origins and the preservation of HCoVs in human distribution.
Expanded evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have an origin from bats and are transmitted to humans through central carriers.
Since SARS-CoV infections are caused by interconnection between humans and dolphins in the market, closing the animal market and killing all of the pirates would have helped put an end to the SARS pandemic.
With the same logic, cocaine should be removed from the animal market to prevent animal distribution, due to the discovery of many beta-CoV-generations found in crabs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through cocaine and other mammals remains clear in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in longer camels for a long time.
These camels serve as a useful tool in transporting along with the main source of meat, dairy, leather products and cotton products for people in the street.
They have spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to kill all camels to control MERS, as it was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the frequent outbreaks of MERS, a definitive focus should be taken to create a suitable vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, as well as other infection control strategies.
Because we cannot eliminate the virus, a new species may emerge and cause outbreaks.
Many species of animal-borne CoVs are transmitted in the wild.
In particular, CoVs caused by bats that can be transmitted by animals are extremely diverse.
There are many opportunities where the animal-borne CoV virus develops and reunites, leading to the emergence of other CoV viruses that are more spread and/or more dangerous to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce the complexity between humans and animals.
Due to the presence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 problems, a well-prepared and adaptive plan should be put in place.
Indeed, many viruses have existed in the world for a long time.
The virus lives in their natural reserves until there is a chance of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that allow the spread of viruses, human space to interact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if humans are taught to stay away from them.
It is important to investigate the progress of animals in order to better understand the ecology of CoV and their natural carriers, which will prove useful in preventing transmission from animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent the transmission of viruses from animals is for humans to stay away from the ecological environment of the natural hosts of the virus transmitted from animals.
Much remains to be known about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, if bats are transmitting the traditional SARS-CoV-2 virus to crabs, it would be interesting to see what conditions in which bats and crocodiles can be found in the same ecological environment.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human distribution, it should be noted how humans interact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal is to serve as a real central carrier, it should be specified how the animal interacts with other organisms including humans, bats and cats.
Finally, since other animals including domestic animals may be at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic and experimental infections should be conducted.
Whether it is a bat, a cocaine or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical viruses will be identified in its natural carriers in the future.
The ongoing investigation in this field will determine the pathway of SARS-CoV-2 growth in animals, with the significant impact in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is important to update the process of "predictable" and "confirmed opportunity" for COVID-19 testing.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick diagnostic and treatment guide for the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and the guide provided our experience and set up good references for combating this pandemic around the world.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge continue to grow based on the results of ongoing physiotherapy and the experience of medical practice; thus, diagnostic and treatment tests are also being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our guide and issued a newer procedure for "probably suspected" and "confirmed" tests according to the latest guidelines for COVID-19 testing and treatment (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus of 2019 (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, now officially known as the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its virus has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consulting guide and has been published online in the Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has been a great success since its publication.
However, keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience of medical services, so, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 testing and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, have issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being changed to content.
Now our guide received feedback from Zhou and colleagues., they brought a simple suggestion to get a diagnosis based on their medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide as well as making a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recommend their hard work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Testing and Treatment Guidelines (Second Test Edition) and recent research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), verification of suspected cases requires to include any single element of the history of anaerobics and two components of clinical expression in order to conduct a thorough investigation or need to meet the three criteria of clinical manifestation if there is no clear biological history:
Epiphysiological history: (1) a history of travel or living in Wuhan and other nearby areas or communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days prior to the beginning of symptoms; (2) a history of dealing with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections (for the most positive doses of the locally occurring pre-infectious cases of pre-inflammaturity, with the most severe cases in the region; (3) a history of contact with patients with severe heat or asthy symptoms from the city).
Medical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or asthma symptoms; (2) visible characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells showing a normal, reduced number of white blood cells in the early stages.
Testing of a confirmed case should be based on the case with any suspected case containing any element of evidence of gnojwa or serology as follows: (1) the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus in real time through PCR tests; (2) the entire sequence of the increased viral genome of the variant of the variant of the virus which indicates a significant similarity to the SARS-2 with the newly identified Imaging Ig virus; (3) the presence of antibod antibodys and antibodys.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nuclear acid on the respiratory or blood sample was added to the second edition (January 18 2020) and third (January 22, 2020).
The pathogenic discovery of the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020); and the serological evidence added to the seventh edition.
These modifications, according to the researchers, continued the task of finding a better packet of nucleic acid detection for rapid testing, as well as samples from the asthma method including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples and helped bring about the positive effects of specific antibodies in a proven procedure.
Besides, there is more evidence that reminds us to be wary of patients with abnormal symptoms and those with no symptoms.
Thus, the chart of Zhou and his colleagues should be updated, because it classified a person without medical symptoms as "low risk".
The marking system also needs to be verified in later practice and medical research.
In the end, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and we invite readers to give their opinion.
For "probably suspected" and "confirmed" tests, we recommend compliance with the new guidelines for their home countries.
Our team will also update our guide in a timely manner to provide support.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily reported cases
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases involving 114 cases and 33 recovered people living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR director Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were for people over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years old and one for 41-50 years.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a major disaster on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu, a local news agency, that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director at the Anti-Corruption Commission in Bengani, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be closed for longer than previously planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of this public transport had originally begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medically, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on 8 March, for two people who returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 cases exceeded one million worldwide, data from Johns Hopkins University showed.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
On the same day, Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia confirmed the first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea announced that it was one of the few countries that did not have the coronavirus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours before 10 a.m., Central European Hours (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infection.
Around the world, several countries have announced more concrete measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, continued the closure of city operations until 1 May.
President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russian citizens will continue to be paid without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese parliament voted to increase the national emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes of support, ten of the parliamentarians who voted not to vote and one vote of the opposition.
Saudi Arabia extended the day of affluence in the holy cities of Mecca and Medinail to continue throughout the day; initially, the time of the ointment was between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduced the number of shampoo papers that one could buy
On the evening of Sunday and Saturday, the Australian supermarkets Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchasing limits to two blocks and one in a row for each transaction at all stores at the national level.
ALDI also launched a single package limit, Monday.
These restrictions were published as messages in the payment sites and on the store's Facebook pages.
Consumers were reportedly buying large quantities due to fears of COVID-19 if people needed to be isolated.
On Wednesday, Woolsworth also set limits for the purchase of shaw paper from home delivery to one package per order.
This change followed the original four-pack limit for each transaction placed by Woolsworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in a press release on 8 March, reported that even after setting the limits of a four-paper package, "some stores were still selling all the paper products within an hour of submission", citing the demand as "unexpected", while ALDI, on a Facebook post on Tuesday referred to it as "unexpected".
Sales increased "with a high incidence" last week, according to Wolsworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the amount allowed to be two packages last week.
To counteract the deficiencies, Coles introduced large packages from the sale and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths imported additional products, while ALDI manufactured products for Wednesday's special plans earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to add products, but the local council's restrictions on when delivery of goods by car disabled his premium.
He expects an increase in production costs, with suppliers trying to meet a few specific needs and plans.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that the early release of the goods, some stores could not run a special Wednesday program.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist from Queensland University of Technology, said that their stores fill products every night.
He cited that paper shampoo is a large product, resulting in a small number of products and being sold, leaving large parts of their shelves vacant and adding a sense of deficiencies.
Coles and Woolworths hold the view that if there were enough products on the shelf, if products such as sweat paper and sweatshirt could be bought and available in abundance, there is a possibility to reduce anxiety, said Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The company that manufactures sheets from used papers Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they sold all their products.
Kimberly-Clark, the Kleenex Toilet Tissue and Solaris Paper manufacturer Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24/7 hours to maintain the supply of goods, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a residential area, reported that some real estate sellers offered a piece of paper to the first broker in a plaintiff in Melbourne, while a few auctions were made due to buyers getting a vacation from the long weekend of Leba Day.
The Thursday issue of NT News, a daily newspaper published in Darwin, included an eight-page section to be cut and used as a sham paper.
The stores initially did not want to set restrictions, to deal with a report from ABC Australia on March 3 where they said they had no plans to set up shopping restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a high demand, including masks, snacks, dry foods, soap to wash hands and flour.
Also, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening, the British online store Ocado appeared to reduce the purchase of Andres' sweatpaper to 12 sheet blocks.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the most widespread COVID-19 disease
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 virus — to be a major disaster.
Although the term "great disaster" refers to the extent of the disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, the World Health Organization recognized the importance of encouraging nations to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this great pandemic.
If the countries recognize, measure, test, tie, monitor and encourage their people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
We are deeply concerned about the rates of infection and severity and the alarming rates of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in a statement published by CNN in February, "but with the flu, no respiratory virus has been traced from the spread to the continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus commented similarly, saying "we have never seen the greatest pandemic caused by the coronavirus before."
He continued, "and we have never seen a massive disaster that can be controlled at the same time."
A new situation such as the Great Depression follows the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak of the disease as a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak of the disease, "basically, it's getting worse."
As of Thursday, the U.S. Broadcasting Corporation reported there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous pandemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a severe respiratory disorder of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak of the disease was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, as a Global Public Health Emergency Concern on 30 January 2020, and identified as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have died.
The death toll rates are estimated to be 4<0x25> in China, while globally they vary from 13.04<0x25> in Algeria to .08<0x25> in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include excessive heat, cough and difficulty breathing.
Problems can include pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic pulmonary syndrome.
The period from infection to the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is to treat the symptoms of the disease and assisted treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and isolate yourself from people suspected of being infected.
Organizations around the world have taken steps by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine, non-walking sessions, workplace risk restrictions, and the closure of buildings.
The pandemic has led to serious social and economic unrest, delays or cancellation of sporadical, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods due to fears.
Schools and universities are closed on an international or regional basis in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4<0x25> of the world's student population.
Lies about the virus have spread online, and there have been incidents of discrimination against people from other countries and discrimination against Chinese people, some people from East and Southeast Asia or have similar appearances, and others from areas with high viral infections.
Following declining transport and the closure of large industries, there has been a decline in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health organizations in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of unidentified pulmonary hepatitis on 31 January 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases were related to the Huanan General Food Market and thus the virus is thought to have a source of transmission from animals to humans.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new virus discovered and related to bat coronavirus, cocaine coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. The first person identified with the symptoms was diagnosed on 1 December 2019, and the person had no visible contact with anyone in the market.
In previous events reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning newspaper said that there was an incident monitored until 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from the Hubei region, may be the first case.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that, as new cases reported in China increased the number of reported cases to the first time in China but exceeded the number of new cases in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of cases.
There may be a lack of reporting of large cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, at least a few cases were reported in young people, those aged 19 and under, accounting for up to 2.4<0x25> of cases worldwide. Britain's Scientific Advisor, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60<0x25> of the UK's population will need to be infected before effective immunization can be achieved through vaccination.
Visa refers to the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their dosage has been confirmed positive according to the official protocol.
By 23 March, no country measured more than 3<0x25> of the population, and many countries have had a formal policy not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, by 23 January, an estimated 86<0x25> of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these unrecorded infections were a source of infection for 79<0x25> of the cases recorded.
A statistical study published on 30 March estimated that Italy's number of infections was much higher than reported cases.
Previous estimates of the number based on production (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States has concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the duration from the appearance of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with normal day numbers being 14.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, as much as 80<0x25> of deaths were in those over the age of 60, and 75<0x25> had previously health conditions as well as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.The official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally mean people who died who were tested positive for COVID according to the official protocol.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 may be more likely, as it may not include people who die untested - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Just a partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths in the pandemic exceeded the official COVID deaths figures for the 4-5x feature.
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States admitted "We know that [the cited mortality figure] is a low estimate", a statement confirmed by certified low counting reports in the United States. The lowest rate often occurs in a major pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a number of deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries had reported deaths, in every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary from place to place and as time goes by, they are affected by the measurement rate, quality of the health care system, type of treatment, time of emergence, and population status such as age, gender, and overall health status.The death rate to case indicates the number of deaths divided by the number of cases identified in a given period.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.0<0x25> (97,039/1,617,204) by 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3<0x25> (for people with symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7<0x25> (for people with symptoms from 1 February 2020). Other estimates include the mortality rate for each case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed with infectious diseases (IVF), the percentage of people who die from disease, the rate of infection.
These data are not blocked by a temporary pattern and follow a specific number of people from the event of the infection to the eventual resolution.
A number of scholars have tried to count these numbers to a specific population.
Oxford University's Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that the mortality rate from infections for a total pandemic is between 0.1<0x25> and 0.39<0x25>.
Highest estimates of this percentage correspond to results from randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany, with statistical studies studying the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization claims that this great pandemic can be controlled.
The height and duration of the outbreak are unknown and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Unchecked, the outbreak of infection usually continues and begins to decrease when the disease is stopped by infected people.
But it's hard to estimate or have accurate estimates at the moment about when that time is".
China's top government adviser Zhong Nanshan said it "may end by June" if all countries can be encouraged to follow the advice of the World Health Organization for measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski London Institute of Hygiene <0x26> Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread, there is a possibility of a year or two".
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, maintaining distances with people and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (there is a possibility of 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it's easily transmitted—will be completely lost" and may "be a seasonal disease, occurring every year".
The condition of the residue will depend on the vaccine to be obtained and the rate of viral change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may not be specific and people infected may not show any symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are high temperature (88<0x25>) and dry cough (68<0x25>).
Uncommon symptoms include fatigue, respiratory toxins (toxins), loss of sense of smell, lack of breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, cold feeling, vomiting, coughing, running, or skin coloring. The World Health Organization says that about one in five people does not breathe very much and tends to
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists emergency symptoms such as poor breathing, persistent chest pain or stress, sudden anxiety, difficulty walking, facial or blue lips; urgent treatment is recommended if these symptoms are present. The progression of the disease can lead to severe lung disease, chronic lung disease and infection.
Some of the infected may not show any symptoms, but their test results prove that they have been infected, so researchers have advised that those who have contact with people who have been confirmed to be infected should be monitored and monitored to alleviate the fear of infection.
The Chinese estimate the range of doses for people who do not show symptoms ranging from fewer to 44<0x25>.
The normal period of symptoms (the period between infection and the appearance of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually is five days.In the case of uncertainty, the estimated percentage of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was previously 30<0x25> and later decreased to 15<0x25>.
Further information on how the disease is transmitted is still being investigated.
This disease is believed to be mostly transmitted during close proximity to the drops that come from coughing, sneezing, or talking; by a person close to 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can enable droplets to travel up to 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be spread by small droplets that remain for long periods of time in the air, which can also come from the time of conversation. Breathing can also come from breathing, as well as speaking, but these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air.
These can reach the lips or nostrils of people close to or drawn to the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as tube implantation and heart and lung respiration (CPR) can make respiratory fluids absorbed into the air and thus spread through the air.
It can also be spread when a person touches a viral area, along with the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are doubts that it can be spread by excrement, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government opposed the possibility of transmission from excrement to SARS-CoV-2.The virus is mostly transmitted three days after symptoms appear, although transmission is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have been tested positive for the disease up to three days before the appearance of symptoms suggests that it is possible to spread before most of the symptoms occur.
There are only a handful of confirmed cases in labs of people who do not show any symptoms yet have the virus, but cases of people infected and who do not show symptoms have been identified by other countries while tracking people connected to patients.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is not fully clear how easy it is to spread the disease, one person generally transmits two or three people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be capable of detecting up to three days in plastic and stainless steel 304, in one day on cardboard, and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature levels. Favorite animals and other animals have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after touching parts of the infected people they may have touched.
Chronic pulmonary disease linked to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a genome virus, first discovered from three people with pulmonary tuberculosis related to cases of chronic respiratory infections in Wuhan.
Symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 gene occur in related coronaviruses around the world.As in the human body, this virus is consumed by home use soap, which breaks the enclosed flower. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be transmitted from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus binds to the coronavirus cell Beta, in a subspecies of the Sarbe virus (generation B) as well as two species from bats.
It is a 96<0x25> similarity in the cellular rate to other coronavirus samples in bats (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference of amino acids in a particular part of the cell sequence between the viruses from the cocaine and from humans.
All cell comparisons so far have detected 92<0x25> of the particle material found in the cocaine coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove the cocaine considered to be a central parasite organism.
The infection of the virus may be temporarily detected based on symptoms, but the evidence is subsequent to the regression method of the chemical cell and the suppression reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected fluids or CT medical imaging.
A comparative study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is largely superior to PCR, though not specific, and its image components interact with other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American Academy of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as a first test to detect COVID-19".
The WHO has published several protocols to test SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with the first publication released on 17 January.
The test uses a replication of a chemical cell and a sequence reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done with respiratory or blood samples.
The results are generally visible within hours to a few days.
Generally this test is carried out using cotton in the nose though taking the sample in the mouth can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing a blood-oriented test, which recognizes the immune system.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be authentic for use by many.
The U.S. blood test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use and only approved laboratories.
Characteristics of radiotherapy and clinical imaging (CT) of infected people include low-pressure pulmonary components and a lack of hydraulic concentration between the chest wall and the lungs.
The Italian Radiology Association gathers an international online database of clinical results of confirmed cases.
Due to follow-up with other infections such as adenovirus, unconfirmed exposure through PCR has limited specific issues in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of CT and PCR chest paints and showed that although medical images are not specific to infections, they are faster and better, indicating its consideration as a filtering device in disaster areas.
Online programs created by artificial intelligence are designed to discover the medical features of viral images and medical images and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, hand washing, prevent touching eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that have not been washed, and coughing or sneezing on tissues and putting dirty tissue directly into the waste container.
Those who may have been infected have already been advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Distance-keeping measures are also recommended to prevent distribution.Most governments have imposed restrictions or advice against any non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
However, the virus has reached the point of spreading to communities in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Medical providers who treated a person who may have been infected are advised to use regular precautions, alerts were contacted with eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of local data from mobile phones and governments for this use has prompted concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing an ad calling for limitation of such surveillance.
Different mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were creating privacy-preserving solutions, such as using Bluetooth to send user distances and other mobile phones.
Users then receive messages if they have been close to anyone who has been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19. A lie is spreading about how to prevent infection; for example, cleaning the nose and spraying with mouthwash mixtures is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are busy making one.
It is recommended to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands seem dirty; before eating; after shaving, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, this virus is consumed by the soap of use at home, which blows its protective foam.
The CDC further recommends using a handful of antibiotics containing at least 60<0x25> alcohol in moderation when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that have not been washed.
The active components can be cleaned and killed by different chemicals (in one minute using chemicals for a component containing stainless steel), including 62-71<0x25> ethanol, 50-100<0x25> isopropanol, 0.1<0x25> sodium hypochlorite, 0.5<0x25> hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5<0x25>podidone
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, have not been very successful.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a building such as offices or nursery schools, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, living rooms, electronic devices such as flat computers, touchboards, keyboards, rims, and ATM machines used by sick people should be cleaned with pesticides.
Health organizations recommended covering the lips and nose with a folded elbow or tissue while coughing or sneezing, and throwing any tissue at once.
Medical masks are recommended for those who may have been infected, as wearing masks can control the volume and distance travel of the respiratory droplets transmitted when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has given instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at the University of Leeds, “wearing masks can reduce people’s ability to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene.”
WHO recommends wearing masks and healthy people only if they are at risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although they have also admitted that wearing masks can help people touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks and public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of cloth.China has specifically recommended the use of medical masks that can be discarded by people in good public health, especially when approaching (1 meters (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in a crowded area.
Thailand's health officials are urging people to make masks with cloth at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned public transit without wearing a mask or covering your lips.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered everyone entering the store to wear masks.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks daily since mid-March, required passengers on trains and city buses to the city to wear face masks on 1st March.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask whenever you go outside, while it also recommends making a banana at home for those who cannot afford to buy a bacon.
Masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as social distancing) includes measures to control infections aimed at reducing the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include; travel restrictions; school closures, workplaces, stadiums, movies, or shops.
People can follow social distance techniques by staying at home, reducing travel, not going to a crowded place, greeting each other without touching each other, and maintaining distances with other people.
Many governments have now ordered or recommended not to contact people in areas affected by the outbreak of the disease.
The size of the collection proposed by U.S. government agencies and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there were no COVID-19 infections in a particular area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public gathering of more than two people.Old and Walw with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and the affected body's immune system on the Internet have a higher risk of serious illness and disorders and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as many times as possible in the area of the outbreak of the disease in the community.
The use of the term “social distancing” has led to speculations that people should be engaged in fully social isolation, rather than encouraging them to keep in touch with others through alternatives.Some authorities have provided guidelines for sexual health to use during the pandemic.
This includes only sexual intercourse with a person with whom you live, who has no viral or symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation has been recommended for those infected with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have provided detailed home isolation instructions in an appropriate manner. Many governments have ordered or recommended quarantine of people living in affected areas.
Extensive instructions on quarantine have been given to those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or territory with a large supply have been advised to quarantine for 14 days from the last possible time they were infected.
Strategies in controlling the outbreak are to prevent the increase or suppression, and avoid one another.
Control is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to monitor and exclude infected people as well as to bring other measures to control infections and vaccines to stop the spread of the disease to other people.
If it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, then efforts are moved into a phase of prevention: measures are taken to reduce the spread and avoid its impact on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of preventive measures and avoidance can be done together.
Compression requires a tough step to reverse the pandemic by reducing the emission-based number to less than 1.The anti-infectious disease is trying to reduce the peak of the outbreak, known as balancing the outbreak.
This reduces the risk of overweight healthcare and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-sociological strategies that can control this outbreak include private preventive measures such as hand washing, masks wearing and quarantine; community measures aimed at social distancing such as schools closing and interrupting mass gatherings in public; community interventions aimed at targeting them as local targets to encourage acceptance and participation in such strategic initiatives; and environmental measures such as cleaning areas
Other countries have also implemented a number of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced public testing and local quarantines, and issued warnings for the transport of infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected and quarantined and fined large amounts to those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of facial masks and fines for handling medical products.
Better prevention policies can reduce the demand for medical services during the outbreak by 2/3 and death by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overburdened health systems.
The suppression is preferred but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to spread in the population (or until the vaccine is available, that comes first), or the transmission resurfaces quickly when the action is slowed.
Long-term measures to suppress the pandemic lead to social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for COVID-19, but efforts to develop them are underway, along with testing for existing drugs.
Taking medications without prescription, drinking water, and rest can help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, acupuncture, drip, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of antibiotics can reduce the effects.
Several chemicals that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being studied for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also mentioned that "some local and domestic solutions" could provide relief to symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing space and adapting health services to the needs of COVID-19 patients is defined by WHO as a key step in tackling the outbreak of the disease.
The ECDC and the European Regional Office of WHO have provided hospital and primary health care guidelines for directing resources at a number of levels, including directing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, canceling scheduled procedures where possible, staying away from and seating patients with COVID-19, and increasing the capacity of high-quality care services by training staff and increasing the number of respiratory and respiratory aid equipment.
There are many theories about where the first case (known as the first patient) may have arisen.
The first known case of the coronavirus genome can be traced to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were associated with the General Fish Market Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came through one of these species; or, in other words, it has a source from animals to humans. The groups of the pneumonia whose origin is unknown were identified on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jihan at the Regional Huabe Hospital.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned of a "coronavirus-like SARS virus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and the other, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving warnings.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
Inadequate cases of undisclosed lung tuberculosis had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan leading to investigations in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every approximately seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, funded by Chinese New Year transport and Wuhan as a transportation hub and a major railway exchange center.
On 20 January, China reported approximately 140 new cases per day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later, official data show that 6,174 people already had symptoms by 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
About 200 countries and communities have had at least one incident.

National responses have included control measures such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, place-keeping orders or temporary closure of normal activities) and cuffs. As of 2 April, approximately 300 million or about 90<0x25> of the population are under some form of normal US activity in the United States, more than 50 million people have been confined to normal operations in the Philippines and about 59 million people have been detained in the United States.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under temporary closure of normal activities, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later - about a third of the world's population.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is struggling to cope with an outbreak due to inaccessibility in the international markets following U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has led to calls for the United States to adopt public health policies that are common in other affluent countries, including public health services and child care.
Political analysts expected that it could adversely affect Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election.The diplomatic ties between Japan and South Korea were worse because of the pandemic.
South Korea denounced Japan's efforts to "underestimate" and underestimate quarantine after Japan announced that everyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government stations.
The South Korean community was initially divided by President Moon Jae-in's response to a state of emergency.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon's removal of claims that the government did not handle the outbreak properly, or praised its response.The pandemic has allowed the country to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have commented that it would allow the government to strengthen their leadership in power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to govern for an indefinite period of time, to suspend parliament along with elections and punish those who seemed to spread false information about the virus and government management in a state of emergency.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several incidents of lack of product,
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand from consumers and disruption of the supply of goods.
Many areas also witnessed people buying in fear of what caused shops to miss essential products such as food, paper and bottled water and trigger a shortage of supply.
The technology industry has been especially alerted to delays in the delivery of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the need for self-defense equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to an increase in prices by up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays in the sale of medical equipment for between four and six months.
It has also led to a lack of self-defense facilities around the world, and WHO warns that this will pose a threat to health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for exporters to export goods from Australia to China.
The activity has resulted in a shortage of children's food in some supermarkets and was therefore banned by the Australian government. Despite the massive spread of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan, and the growing demand for food products continues to grow, the two areas have been left in severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against homophobia and the illicit trade of essential goods have been successful, preventing widespread food shortages in Europe and North America as well.
Northern Italy and its large agricultural production have not experienced a significant decline, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Food shortages in the mall were only temporary, even in the city of Wuhan, with Chinese government officials providing pork reserves to ensure people's access to adequate food.
There are also laws in Italy that require food manufacturers to save in such an emergency.
China's global economic downturn has had a devastating impact: According to a press release dated March 16, China's economy suffered significantly in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to reduce the spread of viruses and retail sales by 20.5<0x25>.
As China's main economic and industrial center, the outbreak of the virus has been seen to have a major impact on the global economy.
Agathe Demarais from the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain unstable until a clearer picture emerges about possible outcomes.

On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH stressed the country's level of payment of China's debt, but maintained a poor appearance.
Sales of goods declined again due to fears of the coronavirus, on March 16, when it was seen to be the most underestimated.
Many people think there is a potential for economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian has praised the timely interventions of the central bank and government.
Central banks deal faster than they handled during the 2008 financial recession.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors by travel restrictions, closures of public places including travel attractions, and government advice against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, with the fall of British regional airline Flybe.
The impact on the luxury fleet industry was at an unprecedented level.
Many railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
This pandemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season associated with Chinese New Year holidays.
Many crowdfunding events were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's Eve party, and private companies also closed their own stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year events and tourist attractions have been shut down to prevent mass gatherings, including Forbidden City Beijing and the original temple exhibitions.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended New Year's holidays to 10 February, and ordered most jobs not to open until that day.
These areas represented 80<0x25> of the country's GDP and 90<0x25> of exports.
Hong Kong increased the response rate of infectious diseases to the highest level and declared the state of emergency, and closed schools until March and cancelled New Year’s celebrations.The retail industry has been internationally affected, with a delay in working hours or temporary closure.
Visits to European and Latin American markets fell by 40<0x25>.
North American and Middle East retailers saw a 50-60<0x25> decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43<0x25> reduction in foot-to-foot trips to supermarkets in March compared to February.
Supermarket operators around the world put more measures, such as increasing sanitation, setting temperature assessment devices to measure consumer temperatures, and cancelling events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latino American estimates, the recession following the pandemic could leave between 14 million to 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than it would otherwise have been in the situation.
In January and February 2020, when the pandemic worsened Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million workers who migrated from rural areas have been stranded at home in the provinces of Hubei.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
Coronavirus outbreak could lead to the dismissal of 47 million people in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32<0x25>, according to estimates by the Union Bank of St. Lois. The temporary closure of normal operations in India has resulted in the millions of workers who have migrated to India since their workers have lost their jobs in the middle of the middle of the workouts in Canada in the past 90<0x25> of jobs. A study from the Angus Reid Institute found 44<0x25>
In the second phase of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a collective loan scheme.About half a million companies in Germany have sent their employees to a government-funded short-term work programme known as Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work plan has also been used by France and the UK.
Performance and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by this pandemic, having influenced the performance of organizations as well as individuals —employed and employed— internationally.
Organizations in the arts and culture sectors tried to ratify their goal (which is usually funded by the public) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and at different levels, museums, libraries, theaters, and other cultural institutions were indefinitely closed by their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response there was a lot of effort to provide alternative services through online platforms. Another recent fast-growing phenomenon due to the disease is the cancellation of religious cults, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and exhibitions, tech conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced confusion. The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Great Roman Week, which takes place in the final week of the season of the Christian Repentance of the Quarterfinals, has been cancelled.
Several dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home but not participate in Mass on Sunday; some churches have made church service accessible through radio, live streaming online or television while others have a car service for members.
Following the Roman Catholic Diocese to close their churches and churches and St. Peter’s Basilica without Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their worship and regulated conventions in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the eruption and temples were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of pilgrims and civilians to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the greatest disruption in the sporting world calendar since World War II.
Many sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2020 UEFA Europa League, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
This outbreak disrupted the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games "will be postponed to another date after 2020 but not more than the 2021 summer season". casinos and other sporting centres in the world are closed and the direct card competition either has been postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to go online, with many online gambling websites reporting a significant increase in the rates of enrollment.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups stopping or cancelling exhibition tours.
Many theaters like those in Broadway also suspended theatrical performances.
Some artists have tried ways to continue creating and distributing work through the Internet as an alternative to live shows, such as live online shows or creating an online "concert" for artists to entertain, distribute, and develop their work.
Many jokes containing the coronavirus content have spread over the internet, with many people turning to humor and humor even in the face of adversity.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increase in unwarranted hatred, racism from other countries, racism has been seen in people from China or Central Asia, and against people from the most affected areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Events of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, Central Asia, North America, and the Asia Pacific region.
Reports from February (where most cases were still only in China) have witnessed racist feelings being directed to different groups around the world in order to be eligible for the virus or to receive the alleged penalty.
Some African countries have expressed concern about China.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported racism according to their origins.
There have been hands-on Chinese, online and outdoors, and for those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the continuation of the outbreak in other countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe with the severe COVID-19 outbreak, would also experience a sense of suspicion and fear over foreigners.People in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a petition to prevent Chinese people from entering their country in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the track <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan posted on Twitter.
Indigenous peoples of China as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported high levels of racial violence, including attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been arrested for referring to the coronavirus as "China virus", a term considered by critics to be racist and racist in China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners rescued from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which uses the same border with China and study in India's capital cities, are reported to have been subjected to the violence associated with the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Government Party unit in West Bengal mentioned that the Chinese had destroyed natural resources and "that's why God decided to avenge them."
The comments were later criticized by the Chinese embassy Kolkata, calling them "fake".In China, racism and racism against non-Chinese residents have increased following the disaster, and foreigners have been called "foreign waste" and targeted for "disposal".
A number of newspapers have removed them for some or all of the information about the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers wrote scientific papers related to the outbreak found with free access.
Some scientists have decided to quickly distribute their results into automated servers such as bioRxiv.

Sexual asthma tests for 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2-related viruses including methods that detect the presence of viruses and those that detect antibodies produced to fight infections.
The presence of a virus in a viral sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA protein of the coronavirus.
This measurement is specific and designed to detect the RNA protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm recent or ongoing infections.
Antibodies can be used in diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibodies show the number of people with the disease including those whose symptoms were too low to be reported or those who did not show any symptoms.
The exact death toll caused by this disease and the immune-resistant level of immunity among people can be determined by this measure.
As of March 2020, no countries had any reliable data on the spread of the virus among their populations.
As of 23 March, no country had measured more than 3<0x25> of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in different countries.
This variability also has a significant impact on mortality rates, which are more likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time (rRT-PCR) dosage can be done on a asthma sample obtained in various ways, including a nose product sample or cosmetic sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR dose performed using throat samples is only expected in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat while continuing to reproduce in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative sample materials can be taken from the depths of respiratory pathways through a body fluid absorption device or coughing can be used.
One of the original PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a real-time (rRT-PCR) measurement, and became the basis for 250,000 packages distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech, developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection package based on the clinical status PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
Searching for a "E" gene similar in all beta coronaviruses, and a RdRp gene that is mainly found in SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive an emergency use permit from the U.S. Emergency Management of Medical Products in the U.S.A.R.R.C.A.A. (U.R.A.)
One of the three generic tests in previous versions of test packages resulted in unwarranted output from bad testing containers, and testing complexes at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average number of less than 100 samples being successfully tested throughout February 2020.
The tests using the premises were not classified as reliable until 28 February 2020, it was until this time that national and local laboratories were allowed to operate the tests.
The dosage was approved by Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Permission.Markani's commercial laboratory began performing tests in March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the presence of a COVID-19 test in a nation using RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 tests available by 9 March 2020.
No standards restrictions have been announced; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 vaccine was developed and produced by the National Center for the Research of Vairology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the dose was registered with the Federal Medical Monitoring Service.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to create a dose to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a dose that would be performed within 3.5 hours for a maximum duration of 24 hours, thus allowing one machine to perform at least one dose.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use license (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a dose of the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued a similar approval to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the same EUA approval from the FDA for a measure of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a measurement that uses nuclear acid production technology based on a stable measure of thermal fibers instead of PCR.
Because this measurement does not require changing temperature sequences, this technique can produce positive results in short five minutes and negative drops in 13 minutes.
Currently there are about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott expects to expand production to produce 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses similar nucleocapsid antibodies (protein N) of new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the belief that it will produce results after 15 to 20 minutes as just a flu test.
An article in March 2020 concluded that "thoracic tests are of less observational value in the original phase, with CT results [sic] being able to exist even before the appearance of symptoms."
Common features on the CT include glasses with double-stranded linear layers that block light with side-by-side, non-synchronous and rear-end.
The presence of subpleural mass, defective pathways and reinforcements develops as the disease continues to grow.
A comparative study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan during the outbreak of the current major pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly superior to PCR, although it is not specific with its many image components to interact with other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the U.S. College of Rediscovery recommends that "CT should not be used to conduct a COVID-19 test or first phase". As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR to be used in preliminary tests.
Part of the body's immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection within people from 7 days after the onset of symptoms, diagnosis of body immunity, and monitoring of people.
Automated physical examination systems in most clinical romances will be able to implement these experiments but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT single side blood samples are used, although chronic samples can be used to monitor body immune responses.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained from skin compression.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA issued the names of 29 organizations that provided information to the organization as needed and therefore are currently able to distribute their antibodies.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under the authorization of emergency use. By the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test packages, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in the sample.
Testing capacity is hundreds of samples within hours and is therefore faster than the standard PCR test of viral RNA.
Antibodies can normally be detected 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the UK found that no antibodies package had been purchased to be best used.
Hong Kong has set up a plan where people suspected of being beaten can stay at home, "an emergency clinic will give the patient a sample bottle", will spit in it, restore it and get the results of the tests over time. The British NHS has announced that it is conducting tests to test patients who are suspected of being ill at home, which eliminates the risk of infection to the patient when they come to the hospital.
In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2, that it had an average of 12,000 daily doses in an ambulance order and 10,700 had been tested last week.
The cost is guaranteed by health insurance when the dosage is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
By 19 March traffic tests were carried out in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not known, because only the results of the affected were reported.
The first laboratory study showed that by the 12/2020 calendar week a total of at least 483,295 samples were measured up to and including 12/2020 week and 33,491 samples (6.9<0x25>) were found to have SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, the samples in the course of the samples were tested in the course of the course of the 5000 samples and the samples in the course of the samples.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in 5 days, estimates showed Hubei cases would be 47<0x25> more and the accompanying cost of dealing with quarantine would double if this measurement was not established.
Wuhan laboratory has been rapidly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily probability was 50,000 doses per day. The different models available free of charge provided by Origami Assays have been provided and are capable of measuring the sample size of 1122 patients of COVID-19 using only 93 doses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without requiring the use of robots to handle water.
By March, deficiencies and poor standards of measurement tools have been challenged by public testing by the EU and the UK and the United States.
This led publishers to investigate the processes of sample preparation involving temperature samples at 98 <0xC2><0xB0>C (208 <0xC2><0xB0>F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further tests.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now measuring more people with coronavirus than any other country, and it was running to exceed rates
This was through the integration of the capacity to serve people where they were and the purchase of laboratories to measure large numbers of people from Group 42 and BGI (according to their "Huo-Yan" emergency discovery laboratories in China).
Built within 14 days, these laboratories are capable of carrying out thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and are the first in the world to be used outside of China.
Various measurement criteria aimed at various parts of the genetic code of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The Ulimungini Health Organization began using the German residue to create packages sent to low-income countries that are unable to create their own.
The German response was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, delaying the tests available in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the effectiveness of early outbreak tests, and these countries and Australia could not provide enough equipment according to the requirements and recommendations of health experts.
In comparison, experts say that access to tests in many parts of South Korea helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The ability to measure, largely in private sector laboratories, was built over a long period of time by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for a vaccine for tests plans as a way to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing packages due to the spread of the virus caused a bulk of hundreds of thousands of doses in private laboratories in the United States, and there was a shortage in the supply of test chemicals.
In March 2020 China reported problems in the accuracy of testing packages.
In the United States, the CDC-designated testing packages were "substantial;" the government then removed the restrictions that prevented personal testing.The Spanish purchased test packages from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the test results were incorrect.
The agency explained that the inaccurate results could be due to the lack of sample collection or the improper use of packages.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove packages that returned incorrect results, and would use packages provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy instead.80<0x25> of the testing packages the Czech Republic purchased from China produced incorrect results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million packages from China that were found not to produce accurate results.
Prime Minister Matovi<0xC4><0x8D> suggested that they be thrown into the Danube river.Ate<0xC5><0x9F> Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the testing packages that Turkey bought from China had "high-definition error rates" and "did not use them."The UK bought 3.5 million packages from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were not in use.
Tests, taken by quarantine of those diagnosed with the disease and monitored by those connected with SARS-CoV-2, occurred in consecutive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of V<0xC3><0xB2>, the site of the first case of COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two tests phases for a total population of 3,400, about 10 days.
About half of the people diagnosed with the disease had no symptoms and all the cases diagnosed were quarantined.
With the passage of time, this completely eliminated the possibility of new infections.
With an ambitious plan to track contacts, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread more slowly than other developed nations, but without the restrictions of worse conditions such as forcing restaurants and retail stores to close.
Most incidents have been interrupted and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools were reopened in due time after the holiday period on 23 March.
Many other countries have also controlled the pandemic with an ambitious plan to monitor contacts, internal travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with a minimum of freezing of normal activities, such as Island and South Korea.
Statistical studies have shown that countries that have measured more, compared to the number of deaths, have lower rates of severe cases, probably because of these countries being better able to identify those with moderate or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that non-qualified countries with less-experienced national laboratories send the first five COVID-19 cases and the first ten non-COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO's relevant laboratories for proof-of-concept testing.
Of the 16 laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the vertical column of "The case of disease as <0x25> of the measurements" is inspired by the testing policy.
A country that testes people admitted to hospitals alone will have a higher percentage of cases of the disease than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), where it is also known as hand washing, is an act of hand washing for the purpose of removing dirt, dirt, germs or other inconsistent substances.
Regularly washing hands with soap at "some important times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example driving with cholera, which is transmitted through the oral excretion pathway.
Individuals can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as colds or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. hydrated membranes).
The five important times during the day when hand washing with soap are important include: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the child's toilet or changing the net, before giving the child food, before and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing meals.
before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing a pin or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet.
After madness, coughing or sneezing.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal excrement.
Medical hand sanitation refers to hygiene activities related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medications or treatments can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to wash hands from viruses (bacterials, viruses, or other pathogenesis) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who are food-careers or working in the medical field, but it is also an important activity for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes by driving; reducing infectious diseases;
Reduce the mortality of children at home.
A 2013 study found that improving hand washing practices could lead to lower levels of aging in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and driving diseases can be prevented by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50<0x25>.
Strategies that encourage people to wash their hands can reduce running periods by about one-third, and this can be compared to providing fresh water in low-income areas.
48<0x25> of the reduction in driving sessions can be associated with soap-based hand washing. Soap washing is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent driving with respiratory infections (ARI), such as regular conduct followed at home, at school and in communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main ARI species, is the number one cause of death in children under five, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Running with pneumonia contributes to nearly 3.5 million child deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before and after meals can save more lives than any vaccine or medical strategy, reducing deaths from driving by almost half and deaths from asthma infection by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually included with other cleaning strategies such as water, sanitation and sanitation (OSHA).
Hand washing also prevents skin rashes that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative effect of hand washing is that regular hand washing can lead to skin damage due to the drying of the disease.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to a condition of skin rashes known to swelling of the hands or skin rashes that are common especially among medical personnel.
Regular hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of mental illness or overdose (OCD).
There are five important times a day when hand washing with soap is necessary to reduce the spread of infections from excretion to mouth: after using the toilet (to go small, to go big), after cleaning the fire it needs (to change its nails), before giving it food, before and before/or after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or bird breeding birds.
Other cases where proper hand washing should be done to prevent the spread of disease include before and after treating an injury; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal wastes or treating them; after touching waste.
In many countries, there is a low level of hand washing with soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on an average, 38.7<0x25> of households were washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97<0x25>; the United States around the middle and 77<0x25>; and China with the lowest rate of 23<0x25> that their children’s behavioral change rates are currently in schools. Several methods of washing their children’s habits are in order to increase the behavior of handwashing of children with soap and soap in these dangerous times.
The "Basic Health Care Program" implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of a high-level initiative to promote the health and education of children.
Killing worms twice a year, supplemented by washing hands daily with soap, brushing daily with florin, is the basis of this national project.
It has also been implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of germs from the skin has been facilitated by adding soap or solid water purification.
An important action of soap and solid medicine is to reduce the inhibitions of the mixture, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not able to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Cleaning, however, is aided by the presence of good water flow.
The soap, due to its reuse status, can keep bacteria recovered from the previous use.
A few research studies that have addressed the distribution of bacteria from contaminated soaps have concluded that the distribution is not easy to occur because the bacteria are washed and removed through the form.
The CDC still mentions that "unregulated water soap in its bath is recommended".
Soaps that kill bacteria have been widely advertised to health-care public.
To date, there is no evidence that using a recommended antiseptic or pesticides select non-medical organisms in nature.
However, soaps that kill bacteria have common antibacterial products such as triclosan, which have a long list of non-mortal species.
Therefore, even if the immortal species have not been extracted from soap against bacteria, they may not function as effectively as they are advertised.
Aside from skin protective medicine, a complex mixture can contain acids (asynchronous acids, askobic acids, inflamed milk acids) as a pH regulator, benzoic acid and other skin-resistant antigens (aloe vera, vitamins, menthas, medicines from the University of Orego)
Hot water that is suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperatures (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C).
However, hot, soapy water is much more suitable than cold, sapphire water to remove the natural oil that holds sand and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of water movement has no effect on reducing microorganisms in the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water treatment for handwashing.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand-washing liquid with waterproof alcohol (also known as alcohol-based, antiseptic or hand-held liquids) became popular.
Many contain isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed with weight-getting ingredients such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to form fat, or moisture supplement such as making glutenium moisture, or foam to be used quickly and minimize the effects of alcohol dryness.
Adding dissolved hydrogen peroxide increases the anti-inflammatory activity. Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95<0x25> of alcohol are suitable for disinfection.
Alcohol-containing agents kill bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, hepatitis, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccines, hepatitis) and fungi.
The 70<0x25> alcohol content kills 99.97<0x25> (log discounts of 3.5, equivalent to 35 decibels) of bacteria 30 seconds after using them and 99.99<0x25> to 99.999<0x25> of the viruses are not suitable for certain login discounts against 4 to 5<0x25> of the bacteria in excess of the hands 1 minutes after using them.
Hand sanitizers containing alcohol are almost entirely inadequate against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common causes of gastrointestinal infection.A sufficient drug or alcohol-containing diet must be properly administered in order to hydrate your hands or cover all hands.
The front and rear part of all hands and center and fingertips are all rubbed for at least 30 seconds until liquid, foam or matte dry.
The fingertips should also be washed well, by rubbing them on all hands. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than handwashing, especially when it is clear that the hands are dirty.
The increase in the use of these liquids is due to the ease of its use and rapid antibiotic activity, however, it should not be used as an alternative to hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Regular use of alcoholic syringes can lead to skin dryness unless emilients and/or skin softeners are added to the formula.
The effect of skin drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emolinetic ingredients to the formula.
In clinical trials, liquids containing alcohols containing emulent organs resulted in lower absorption and drying of the skin compared to other antimicrobial soaps.
Alzheimer's problems with skin contact, skin rashes or disorders resulting from alcohol or organs in alcoholic beverages are less common.
The low probability of causing skin burns turned into an attraction compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, non-water products do not wash their hands from organic materials, but they are disinfected by them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of germs because such germs still remain in the hands.
The efficacy of non-alcoholic substances depends heavily on its organs and cells, and historically they have not done well compared to those with alcohol.
More recently, the combinations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a stable and general antimicrobial activity after use, compared to alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in its effectiveness after use for some time, probably due to continued causing serious skin problems.
Many people from low-income communities are unable to afford soap prices and use ash or sand instead.
The ash or sand may be more suitable than water alone but may not be more effective than soap.
One concern is that if sand or ash contains germs, it can further spread the hit instead of reducing its spread.
Like soap, ash is also an antimicrobial product because when mixed with water, it forms an alkaline mixture.
WHO recommends ash or sand as alternative soap products when soap is not available.
The appropriate hand washing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of the spread of the disease includes the following steps:
Use water to wash your hands or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because static basins can be dirty, although water temperatures do not appear to be different.
Wash your hands using a soapy amount, including the back of your hands, the middle of your fingers and even the bottom of your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better with soap than with water alone.
Sprinkle for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin and to rub them over longer periods of time removes even more bacteria.
Wash well with running water.
Swallowing on the bench can also contaminate your hands again.
Dry the water with a clean towel or allow it to dry in the air.
Hands that are hydrated and moist can be easily hybrid again.The parts that are often forgotten are the thumb, arm ankle, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Fragments and coating colors set up to carry germs.
Skin softening oil is often recommended to help the hands get dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can lead to an increase in the risk of infection.
Low-cost options can be developed to enable hand washing in place of canal water and/or soap is not available for example pouring water from a well-drained stove and/or using ash if needed in developing countries. In cases where there is not enough water (such as schools and stoves in developing countries), there are some cost-effective water storage solutions, such as "reserved drains"
A suspension canal is a simple technology that uses a ropes-lined jar and a leg-driven tube to pour a little water into the hand and into a piece of soap.
Appropriate hand washing is an important part of the hand washing process, but the debate continues about the most effective methods of handwashing in public bathing areas.
Growing research suggests that paper towels are much cleaner than drying stoves in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the paper towel manufacturers industry of the European Cheap Paper Exhibition, in order to compare the sanitation standards provided by paper towels, drying the hands of the air movement and drying the most modern jet-air hands.
After washing and drying hands using hand dryer in the air, the total number of bacteria was found to increase average on the fingers by 194<0x25> of the chin by 254<0x25>.
The drying of the hands of the jet-air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42<0x25> and in the palms by 15<0x25>.
After washing and drying hands with tissue, the total number of bacteria decreased on the fingers by an average of 76<0x25> and a small inch by up to 77<0x25>. The scientists also conducted experiments to determine if there was any possible contamination of other bathroom users and bathroom environments due to all types of hand drying techniques.
The drying machine, which releases the unit's air at a claimed speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing germs from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and bathroom environment up to 2 mph.
The use of air-conditioned hand dryers disperses germs up to 0.25 meters away from the machine.
Tweets did not show an extreme spread of germs.In 2005, a study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Product und Umwelt, different hand drying techniques were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying hands were observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand-washing products, and these hand drying products have been compared against the use of tissue.
Washing your hands using hand-washing liquid anti-inflammatory tissue is an alternative when traveling with no soap and water.
Hand-to-hand disinfectants should contain at least 60<0x25> alcohol.
Medical hand washing became a necessity long after Hungarian specialist Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospital settings.
There are electronic devices that are used to provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they are forgotten.
Some studies have shown a reduction in the rates of infection due to its use.
Hand washing is recommended for 15 seconds medically, using a saucepan of soap and water or rubber oil for each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by tying the fingers together.
If there is a debris under the edges, a smooth brush can be used to remove it.
Since microorganisms can remain in water in hand, it is important to properly wash and dry hands with clean towels.
After drying, these tissues should be used to close the water (and open any outer door as needed).
This prevents re-infecting the hands from these parts.
The purpose of hand washing in the area of health care is to remove germs ("infectious") and prevent transmission.
The New England newspaper reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in many medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before touching patients and thus transmitting germs.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood-related catheter-related infections by 66. The World Health Organization publishes a table showing common methods of washing and rubbing hands in medical sectors.
The organization's manual manual of hand sanitation can also be found on the organization's website for public opinion.
Related studies were conducted by Whitby and other authors.
Commercial equipment can measure and verify hand sanitation, if a law-abiding display is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Times" for Hand Washing:
When it comes to blood clots or blood clots
in the presence of bacterial infections, and
after serving a patient. The addition of bacterial chemicals with soap (a "medical" or "virtual" soap) enables a hand washing product to kill bacteria.
Such an antibacterial action may be required before surgery or in an environment in which antibiotics are resistant to antibiotics and antibiotics are present in abundance.In order to 'cut' your hands through surgery, it is necessary to have a canal that can be opened and closed without washing the filtered filters, the amount of chloroekscine or filtered hands, the amount of iodine polished, the towels.
All names are to be given.
This process requires hand washing and hand sanitizer to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
The length of the scrub (10 minutes) is not required.
When you turn it off, the contents of the handheld should be prevented from flowing back and forth again by hand.
After the time of hand washing is complete, the hands are washed with a parasite-dependent cloth and a surgical chunk.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a bacterial chemistry before and after serving the patient.
With the control of bacterial infections in the hospital, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand washing occurred in the first 20<0x25> of the washing, and that the lowest benefit was achieved when the hand washing rate was increased by more than 35<0x25>.
Soap alone causes more than three times the distribution of the infectious disease spread by the bacteria in food compared to washing with soap containing an antibacterial chemical. Compared with hand sanitizer with alcohol-containing ingredients and handwashing with more chemicals that contain less soaps than bactéries containing more than 26<0x25> bacterial antibacterials for an average time of 30 seconds all showed to scrush hands
But soap and water are more suitable than a combination of hand sanitizers with alcoholic hands by reducing the H1N1 flu virus A and Clostridium complexe cells from the hands. Strategies to improve hand sanitation in the field of health care can involve staff's education about hand washing, to increase the availability of a combination of hand sanitizers containing alcohol, and written reminders.
There is a need for more research on which of these strategies are effective in different theme of health care.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a low-cost, essential to good health, and even a healthy diet.
However, lack of reliable water, hand washing equipment or soap in private homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge in fulfilling the world’s habit of hand washing.
For example, in many of our African villages, hand washing facilities are limited in almost every private or public toilet, although affordable ways are available to build hand-washing facilities.
However, low levels of hand washing can also be a result of habitual behavior but not due to lack of soap or water.
Promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, increase awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavioral changes in people.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is essential.
A systematic study of 70 studies found that socially involved techniques are effective in increasing handwashing in LMIC, while campaigns to encourage communities to change behaviors appropriate to a minimum.One example of the development of handwashing in schools is the UNICEF's "Three-Star Method" that encourages schools to take simple, low-cost steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning requirements.
When low levels are achieved, schools can move from one star to the next three stars.
Construction of hand-washing facilities can be part of a campaign to promote hand-washing campaigns that are underway to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of a awareness campaign that is trying to bring about a change in behavior. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF improved the use of hands-washing emoji.
A small number of studies have taken into account the overall cost of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the DALY dose.
However, one study suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation strategies.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in dangerous situations such as mothers who gave birth or soldiers who suffered injuries in hospitals - was first discovered in the mid-19th century by two predecessors of hand sanitation: a physician from Hungary named Ignaz Semmelweis a rocket worked in Vienna, Australia and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder".
At that time many people still believed that the infection was caused by a bad odor known as miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks caused through food and health-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fully develop hand sanitation as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 flu outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have caused a growing awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, banners labeled "accurate hand washing techniques" were mounted near hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing your hands from" a matter, means declaring to a person not wanting to take responsibility for a matter or joining others in an illegal or moral matter.
It comes from a biblical passage in Matthew where Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucifix Jesus Christ, but it has become the most widely used passage in some British societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Daughter Macbeth begins to force her hands to try to clean up the supposed spot, pointing to a guilty conscience about the crime she committed and persuading her husband to act.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and seem to appreciate more hand washing equipment.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflections are less likely to engage in other deficiencies for "purification", such as self-sacrifice.
Religion commands the washing of hands for hygiene and as a sign. The washing of hands as a sign, the washing of hands without soap, is part of the ritual of hand washing in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilate yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require the washing of hands after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require the washing of hands before and after each meal.
Risks in the workplace of COVID-19
The COVID-19 risk controls at work are the use of workplace safety and health risk management techniques in preventing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls in the workplace correspond to the workplace and the work being carried out, following the assessment of the risk of the source of risk, the extent of the disease in society, and the risk factors of employees who may be infected with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workflows are rarely contacted by the public and other employees, and basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing decents, and maintaining orderly cleaning and cleaning of the pharmaceutical theme.
Average risk jobs include those that require regular or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of COVID-19, but are likely infected due to ongoing community distribution or international travel.
This includes employees who are connected to the general public such as school, a demographic workplace, and a number of large-scale retail businesses.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-quality air filters, sneezing restrictions, and having personal protective equipment available if a person with COVID-19 is found.
OSHA considers health workers and bodyguards at risk and individuals identified or suspected of COVID-19 to be at higher risk, which increases if workers perform procedures that produce aerosols in, or collect and handle models, known or suspected from a person with COVID-19.
Control of hazards suitable for these workers includes engineering controls such as rooms with low levels of air and environment, and self-defense equipment suitable for the work being done.
Covid-19 outbreaks can have serious consequences in the workplace.
Employees may be unemployed from being ill, needing to care for others, or from fear of being at risk.
Business styles can change, in the type of products needed, and ways to get those products (such as buying goods at times when there are not many people or through transit or services while you are in the car).
Finally, the shipment of goods from seriously affected areas with COVID-19 can be interrupted. Preparation plans and response to the infectious disease can be used to guide preventive measures.
Plans address risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks undertaken, including risk factors, risk factors from home and community components, and risk factors of individual workers such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also list controls that are appropriate to deal with these risks, and emergency plans for situations that may arise following an outbreak.
Preparations for infectious diseases and response plans may follow the recommendations of a country or region.
The aims of the response to the outbreak include reducing the distribution between workers, protecting people who are at greater risk for chronic medical problems, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other organizations and those involved in the transport of goods.
The severity of the disease in a society where the business is involved affects the response taken.
The risk-control system is a system widely used in occupational safety and health settings in risk control groups based on efficiency.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most appropriate controls are engineering, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately self-defense equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating workers from work-related risks independently of employee behavior, and can be a cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures that require action by an employee or an employee.
Self-defense devices (PPE) are considered to be less effective than engineering and administration controls, but they can prevent some incidents of presence at risk.
All types of PPE must be selected in accordance with the risk to the worker, and worn appropriately (e.g., breathing aids), always and well-dressed, routinely inspected, maintained, and replaced, and properly disposed of, cleaned, and placed or cast to prevent infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States, low-risk jobs are interconnected with people in the workplace and the public and other employees.
Basic measures to prevent infection recommended for all workplace themes include regular and well-equipped hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, breathing demeanor including coughing and sneezing, providing tissue and dirt bottles, preparing to work from home or to work on remediated chemotherapy shifts as needed, advising workers not to use the equipment of others to clean and maintain.
Rapid detection and isolation of people who are suspected to have the infection is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with chronic respiratory symptoms should stay at home until they have no high temperatures, symptoms of extreme temperature, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of these medications the patient has to be familiar with the patient who is dealing with the symptoms, and that the family vacation policies are adapted to the situation, allowing workers to stay at home.
According to OSHA, risk jobs on average include those that require regular contact or close contact with people between six feet (1.8 m) who are not known or suspected of COVID-19 patients, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing social distribution around the business area, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a wider distribution area.
This includes the recruitment of the members of the public in general, such as in schools, multi-functional workplaces, and other multi-popular retailing sectors.Industry controls for this and most likely transmission groups include the installation of high-frequency air filters, uploading currents and air-flows such as inhibits of scratching, and scratching through the flows.
It is rare for workers in this dangerous group need to use a respirator.
If a person becomes ill on a plane, good stability to protect the crew and other passengers includes isolating the patient from others at a distance of 6 feet, selecting one flight attendant to handle the patient, and providing a face mask to the patient or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose and tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Airline crews should wear medical gloves that you can throw when caring for sick passengers or touching body fluids or areas that may have been infected, and preferably more personal protective equipment if the patient is overheated, coughing, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other materials thrown after use should not be thrown into special hospital waste containers, and infected parts should be cleaned and cleaned later.For shipping, including luxury ships and other passenger vessels, other hazardous vessel controls are included in order to order a trip if you are sick, and to separate and inform the health center of the vessel at once if one has a condition.
Appropriately, medical monitoring takes place in a person’s isolated room.For schools and child protection facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closure of disposable or drug-cleaning if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of social distribution.
While there is limited to average social distribution, non-compliance techniques can be implemented such as cancelling educational travels, conferences, and other large gatherings such as sports sessions or gaming training or meals in restaurants, increasing the space between the desks, lessening the arrival and departure times, reducing the number of unwanted visitors, and using a separate health office area for children who have symptoms of flu.
While there are serious infections in the community, by talking about strategies for disconnection, the closure of more school time can be considered. For law enforcement ministers who perform daily activities, the risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must contact people confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, as well as real protective equipment.
If there is a close contact when taken, workers should clean and clean their tape and equipment before using a home cleaner again, and follow the usual procedures to work with PPE dispensers and laundry and laundry.
Osha considers other workers and bodybuilders to be at high risk or in the category of high risk of infection.
Works that are at high risk include providing health care, support, laboratory, medical transport staff who have contacted patients who are known or suspected of COVID-19.
These jobs are at high risk of infection if workers are implementing aerosol production procedures, or collecting or processing samples from patients who are known or suspected of COVID-19.
The processes for producing aerosols include inserting a tube into the urine, bronchoscopy, some processes and dental diagnosis, or the collection of samples by scratching,
High-risk functions of the ambulance diagnostics include employees involved in organizing bodies of people identified or suspected of COVID-19 at the time of their departure; these are becoming high-risk tasks of transmission if they are to carry out an autopsy. Additional engineering controls of these risk groups include clinical settings for patients who are known or suspected of COVID-19.
A positive air-conditioning transmission can be suitable in some health care settings and body-storage rooms.
Samples should be handled with level 3 safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering are isolated in special waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory aid machines for those working around 6 feet of patients identified, or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those implementing aerosol production procedures.
In the United States, N95-approved or better NIOSH facial respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory system that includes, measuring fitness, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respiratory aids can provide greater immunity and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO recommends ovarian, as COVID-19 is a respiratory system disease and is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends surgical masks only for an inspector in the entry area.
For those who collect respiratory samples starting from caring for them, or transporting COVID-19 patients without processes to produce aerosols, WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, face shields, gloves, and gloves.
If the process of producing aerosols is implemented, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since international access to PPE is insufficient, WHO proposes to reduce the need for PPE through the transfer of medical information, physical restrictions such as intuitive windows, to allow those only involved in direct care to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using the sole PPE necessary to monitor the particular application of the PPE, to continue to use the respiratory aid machine without taking care of patients.

[COVID-19] [CoVID-19] Restoring the burden and preparing for the future
TIME/TIME SERVICE: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: No rights reserved
We are in a very special situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the things that makes it clear that we have a close human relationship with the world and the responsibility we have for each other.
We have no first place for its challenges, but we do not know that our best responses are based on the type of global empathy, co-operation, and community formation that is the heart of this organization.
The faith and friendship and care that we have among all our partners via email, phone, and chat is a unique legitimacy of good people with whom we have been fortunate to work.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as my friends.
Last week, someone shared with me and I thanked him for his work.
He reminded me of the importance of the world to be able to use Wikipedia right now, and the main point is for this vital resource to remain online and accessible to all.
Your job makes this possible, whether it's to keep stations working or paid colleagues or our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, this time more than ever before.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it, it will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your work on it, we will be making some important adjustments about how we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team c met last night to discuss the route and our schedule of the days and months to come.
In these discussions, we focused on what we thought would be the correct answer to what we were going through and the best way to promote the organization at this time.
Amazingly, we all wanted to remove the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you want to call us, that's right.
For employees, contractors, and all contract workers:
Our expectations for daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week for an indefinite period.
We don't advertise holidays - if you can work longer hours, our mission can use you.
However, this world cannot be forged at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, find a vegetable, or go to a doctor, your interests are our priority.
We don't follow your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should be clear, but we say it.
There are no days of illness or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team through the calendar and schedule to make sure the main areas of work are handled.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryana at T<0x26>C Ops to know so that T<0x26>C can help you with support and make sure your condition can be properly monitored by management).
Employees who work full-time will be paid full wages.
We have already said this, and we are again committed to respecting our commitments to our contractors and our clock workers.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal hours of work during normal conditions.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of dealing with their misery and our world.
What we do can be very rewarding, especially at this time.
Again, this is about taking care of yourself.
We ask that you contact our manager, so that we know what to expect and we can fix it.
Other tasks are considered important.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust <0x26> Safety, and Fundraising (among other teams) are doing important tasks that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all departments to assess current goals and be able to focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are many things to do for all of us, we will all focus on the most important goals.
The reduction, however, is not going to happen later.
We don't plan to go for "more time to compensate" as soon as the pandemic passes.
You will not be expected to work overtime to reach conclusions that are currently impossible.
We agree that the situation has changed, and we will work to set new goals and time as much as possible.
What happens with the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and the prospects for working hours every day, we aim to adjust the delivery time of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget to allow our employees to prioritize important work, personal care, and care for their loved ones while providing for those in need or wanting to work for a reduced amount of time over the next few weeks.
This increase in time greatly reduces current planning and pressure work across the organization.
We will send our recommendations to the Board next week and inform the members and the team of the following steps as soon as possible as we have proof.
Thank you for the APP team for your guidance on this matter.
Office status, transmission, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF colleagues may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, with a large lecture, we hired well-designed killer cleaners to clean up all areas in the San Francisco office.
They used the antiviral solvent used in the hospital to clean up everywhere, even in the hallways and stairs that reach our floor.
This building uses its maintenance functionality to use products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well-prepared at the time when we will decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all the staff in DC.
Until last week, our D.C. office moved its operations so that it could be carried out in accordance with the orders shared by San Francisco.
According to some of our NYC colleagues, we have also been discussing renting the Brooklyn area.
These discussions are ongoing, but can be postponed.
Some of them are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely know that it can be a difficult situation to adapt, and they wanted to offer some advice:
Reduce the length of meetings by an hour or two.
If long sessions are needed, consider how they can be separated over a period of several days.
Describe the meeting clearly, have a agenda, and send early reading material.
Make the video default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to enable integration and direct connection.
Have a leader to enable each meeting, a person to follow the discussion with questions and track a list of speakers, and a person to help write quotes (or collaborate in writing quotations).
Send an email to technical support if you need a good header device.
Make use of your money to buy the snacks.
Join the <0x23>remoties center in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work
The HR Activities team adheres to the web environment guidance to help in the increase in the workloads distributed in the Foundation.
Last week we asked all recipients of community subsidies to cancel all public events sponsored by Wikimedia, such as editors, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
We informed them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it difficult to complete their agreed granting activities and that no one would be punished for delaying or amending those objectives.
This week, we'll look at some of the most important topics on Wikimania and other regional conferences and the theme community.
General comments from global societies seem to express sadness for disruption but comfort for transparency and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Continuing forward, CRT is engaged in setting up a page about Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the results and track our communications with them.
Keeping in touch about COVID-19 issues
We will be sending an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will take this time to share extra posts, answer your questions and take the time to connect with each other.
We are here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other important information related to COVID-19, at the Office Week.
The CRT will update these pages and all details in one place.

Angiotensin (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer part (the cell network) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 reacts with activity related to the enzyme converting angiotensin (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) by making it a good drug to treat cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human enzyme version is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 enzyme is a zinc containing an enzyme of metal atoms located in the area of the end cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of the amino peptide N and the domain of the transport of the amino acids of the kidney colectin terminal C
ACE2 is a membrane protein of type I of a single pathway, its active digesting domain located at the top of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The external ACE2 gastrointestinal domain holds the membrane domain to another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting melting protein is extracted from the bloodstream and eventually released through the urine.
ACE2 is found in many organs: ACE2 is attached to the membrane of the alveola type II pulmonary cells, the small intestine enterosate, the final veins and veins and soft tissue cells in many organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also found in the brain membrane, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain system.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE balancer.
ACE binds to the hormone I of angiotensin in the blood pressure angiotensin II.
Its side ACE2 binds to carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and breaks it into angiotensin of the vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-P-Hile).
ACE2 can also bind to several links including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the transport of the transporter membrane SLC6A19 of natural amino acids and has been cited for Hartnup syndrome.
As a membrane-transmitter protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the SI protein SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the domain of the ACE2 enzyme at the top of the cell causes endocytosis and the transfer of viruses and enzymes to enzymes inside cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S and protein blockers of the main TMPRSS2 serine, an inhibition that is currently being studied as a possible treatment. This has led some to assume that reducing ACE2 levels, in cells, can help to cope with infection.
However, many professional and management organizations have recommended continuing with the standard ACE and ARB treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2013, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34<0x25> decrease in pneumonia risk compared to regulators."
Additionally, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitions who had a higher risk of developing pneumonia, especially those with a stroke or heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were weaker than the general risk of pneumonia."
Human integrated ACE2 (rhACE2) has been considered to be a new treatment for severe lung injuries, and it has been found to improve blood circulation and oxygen stability in small pigs with acute respiratory disorder of lipolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and will begin to work after 30 minutes with the cause of the result (time) 24 hours.
Several results suggest that rhACE2 may be a good drug for those who are unable to tolerate systemic renin-angiotensin (RAS obstructions) or in diseases where the rotating angiotensin II is preferred. A combination of rhACE2 has been estimated in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic respiratory disorders.
COVID-19 programs are mobile applications designed to help identify people who have been contacted to deal with the coronavirus 2019-20, i.e. the process of identifying people ("people they have met") who may have been contacted by an infected person.
Many programs were developed or proposed, with official government support in several districts and areas.
Several search engines have been developed.
Privacy issues have been suggested, especially regarding systems that depend on monitoring the geographical location of software users.
The less automatic alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to keep the user's nearest area for other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would merge functionality to accept the Bluetooth-based apps directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has released a program that allows citizens to check if they have been contacted by people with COVID-19.
It is used for more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a project called TraceTogether is in use.
The program was developed by the local community and IY, presented as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKrona!", a Bluetooth-based software to find infected people who can spread and provide quick responses to health care authorities.
The program was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Health Wire.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for approval from the Google Play Store and the App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the search program was at the top stages of development, and would be implemented within a few weeks. The same program is scheduled in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are focusing on the program based on TraceTogether’s Singapore program and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to launch a program based on the area of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they are not leaving home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of functional problems of software systems, including false positive views and a possible lack of effectiveness if software use is restricted to a small number of people.
To address problems with the distribution of "coronavirus" programs that are misleading or malicious, Apple sets restrictions on what kind of organizations that can keep programs related to coronavirus in its App Store, preventing them from only "official" or other prominent organizations.
Google and Amazon have also made use of these tools.
Private campaigners expressed concern about the impact of the surveillance of large numbers of people using a coronavirus prototype, particularly about whether an investigation infrastructure designed to address the coronavirus disease will be dismantled after the disease has been controlled.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement saying that restrictions were placed on this type of investigation.
The organizations announced four conditions in the government's goals:
must be "legal, relevant, and relevant";
(a) must be monitored and monitored by time-frame rules;
The use of data must be restricted to the purposes of COVID-19.
Data security and anonymity must be protected and shown to be protected in accordance with the evidence;
should be avoided by the use of adhesives and anti-inflammatory;
must share all data with third parties as defined by law;
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to treat abuse;
Significant participation of “all key stakeholders” will be required, including for public health experts and allocated groups. The German Chaos Compute Club (CCC) and Writers Without Obstacles (Reporter Ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also provided an audit list.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing investigation problem by removing the deletion process from their device's operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used web-based area monitoring instead of software, eliminating the need to download apps and capabilities and avoid searches.
In Israel, web-based monitoring was accepted.
Web-based solutions that have access to real-time data have potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with the main server require access to personal area data; several privacy management systems have been developed that only use the main server for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-programming system was used to conduct a search of interconnected people.
Instead of using a single application, the system collected search information from various sources including mobile device search data and card purchase data, and included these to provide notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to inform potential people, the government has also made local information accessible to the public, something that is allowed due to changes in the privacy law of details after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Several countries including Germany focused on the use of mainstream and privacy systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not been released.
The search for intimate individuals whose privacy has been preserved is a well-established concept, with a large group established long ago in 2013. Until 7 April 2020, many groups of experts were addressing privacy solutions that are easy to use, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to keep the user's immediate area on other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has all the means of the same authority and various authorities, and not the same protocol. The multi-authority protocols include the Search for the Near Area whose Privacy Area is Reserved with the Authoritarian (DPP-PP/DP-3T) Tracking and Permanent Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Subject Numbers)
In these protocols, identifiable personal data does not come from the device, and all comparisons take place on the device.
The Privacy Group MIT Media Lab has been creating SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-saving techniques when collecting and using location or data to track COVID-19 infections.
It is based on a study from the whitepaper “Programs Have Been Lagai: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Explosion” released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the Enigma’s SafeTrace platform MPC, a private technology developer that was also founded in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive area and health data to users and other officials, without affecting the privacy of such data.
On 5 April, the TCN International Partnership was established by groups that had been associated with similar approaches and protocols, with the aim of reducing the division, and facilitating the international collaboration of research and information programs, an integral part of achieving greater use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Appe, companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a plan to search for connected individuals, which they claimed to be protecting privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy cryptocurrencies.
They also published the identification of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three stages:
Provide tools to enable the government to create official search programs for people with coronavirus that protect privacy
The integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple's ongoing investigation problems plan by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it simultaneously after the threat is gone.
Alternative medicine (also known as the use of other medications, setting up a new shape, resulting in a new workout or altering the drug) is to send the approved medication elsewhere for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition instead of using it for a previously developed reason.
This is one of the methods of scientific research that is currently being pursued to promote safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and taking the immune system of a person who has recovered and delivering it to a patient through blood. SARS-CoV-2 contains nearly 66 pharmaceutical proteins, each containing multiple molecular sites.
Analysis of these integration sites provides a good project to develop the best antiviral drug that will provide COVID-19 proteins.
The most targeted SARS-CoV-2 proteins are proteases such as papain, RNA based on RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribophosphatase.

There is a lot of research going on at Duke University and Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts safety and efficacy tests for hydroxychloroquine use.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that favipiravir was "effective"
35 patients in Shenzen were evaluated and the results were negative in an average of 4 days, where the length of the disease was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half were given umifenovir.

On 2 April, Germany announced it would purchase the drug from Japan for its savings, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has held earlier negotiations with the Trump administration about buying the drug. The drug may not be effective for a severe disease where the virus has already increased.
It may not be safe to use by pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the immune system lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was seen".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from producing copies by linking them with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drug to find a cell that will connect to SARS-CoV-2 protease.There is criticism in the scientific community about directing restructuring resources specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Union Experiment.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections . Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against the filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronavirus.
One issue with antiviral therapy is the rise of resistance through changes that can lead to severe disease and infection.
Some early remdesivir studies suggest that it may be a major genetic barrier. There are several clinical trials in progress, including two conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospitals, one for people with moderate illnesses and another for people with severer illnesses.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C to pass the injections to people admitted to hospitals and seriously ill with COVID-19; two under control (China, Canada) and one uncontrollable (Italy).

The COVID-19 vaccine is a design vaccine to prevent the spread of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there has been no clinical trials, there are several ongoing tests to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be found in less than 18 months.
The five vaccines selected were in the Phase I Survey.
COVID-19 was confirmed in December 2019.
A massive explosion spread around the world in 2020, leading to massive investments and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use published genome to create possible vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
Specified in April, the requirements of the CEPI programme for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, standard use, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being researched and developed at the beginning of 2020 to create a suitable vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The main objectives of the platform that have been undertaken in Phase I security research include:
Cell nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and selective vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Virus diagnosis tools (Phase I developer and selective chajo: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus of type 5 vector).
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 selected vaccines are being developed for early stages, with 78 being confirmed as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others being announced, but with fewer public information (assuming they are planned or created).
The Phase I-III test runs a preliminary security and immunogenesis test, usually does not follow a specific procedure, is controlled through placebo and in various locations, while detecting more accurate and efficient doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a diagnosis group, and measure the effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent the disease, while tracking adverse effects to the best dose.
Of the 79 vaccines selected to be developed (confirmed at the beginning of April), 79 vaccines had not been tested on humans (they are still in the study "before clinical trials").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is conducting a study of the possibility of a vaccine to bind a molecule that can alter the genesis of viral proteins to stimulate the immune system.

On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they were working with 11 isolated individuals, and that even if they follow up quickly it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a cell like coronavirus under hemisphere funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine test is in laboratory research, and the human test program is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trumo gave CureVac, "a significant amount of money for the exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government opposed.
On March 17, 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly create a mRNA-based vaccine.
The selected vaccine based on mRNA, BN162, is currently being tested on animals and the clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that they will have results in animal testing in April 2020 and the last prescribed vaccine could begin to be tested in the spring.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Epidemiologic Innovation Program (CEPI) announced a <0x24>4.9 million investment in COVID-19 vaccine research partnerships involving the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh to become a million dollars, bringing the overall CEPI investment of development.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Modema, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing using six vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a more potent RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was prepared within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced <0x24>275 million to fund 96 medical testing projects against COVID-19, including several vaccines selected from Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Canadian government announced <0x24>192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine alone, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" for several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in rats, saying that "MNA provided a small SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine that induced a powerful antigen - a special antibodies [in mice] that appeared to be thought from 2 weeks after the vaccine."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Medicine announced the design of a selective vaccine based on DNA as a possible stainless steel sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be produced from copies within the human bacteria to produce cells as harmless viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to deliver antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, governments, industry, and three U.S. universities provided access to the mainstream computers from IBM, as well as resources to provide computing services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different side effects, also known as non-specific side effects.
This means that they can be more effective than the disease that prevents them.
More unorganized experiments in Australia are seeking to hire 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible that the vaccines developed were not safe or will not produce the expected results.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using special COVID-19 vaccines of mammals, such as ACE2 containing genes from mice, other laboratory animals, and other nonhuman cells, shows the need for a 3-digit inhibition measure of infectious cells' safety, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MARS have been measured in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there has been no vaccine or vaccine against SARS that has been shown to be safe and predictable for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the diagnosis and growth of vaccines and new drugs to treat SARS was a priority issue for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is also no confirmed vaccine against MERS.
When MARS began to spread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and the other three are continuing, all of which are antiviral vaccines, two DNA viruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have developed a radical theory claiming that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
The copyrights cited by various social media publications refer to the existing copyrights of the generic series and vaccines for other types of coronaviruses such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe respiratory problems (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and respiratory problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat sores, loss of sense of smell, and stomach pain.
From the time of infection and the symptoms are usually around five days, but it can be from the second or fourteenth day.
While a large number of cases cause severe symptoms, some promote that viral pneumonia or various organs stop working.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mostly spread among people who are close to each other, often through small droplets released when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are produced when moving out, they fall on the floor or on areas rather than infecting each other at a distance of a meter.
People can also be infected by touching an infected area and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live in areas up to 72 hours.
It is more infectious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The most common method of detecting the real-time alteration of the polymerase chain quotations (rRT-PCR) from the cells released in the nose.
People who are suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers are advised to use masks.
The general public's recommendations to wear masks vary, with some authorities recommending their non-use, some recommending them to be used, and others recommending that people use them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or special treatment to prevent COVID-19.
Internal infections have been reported in many countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be wrong to treat symptoms or to show symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and respiratory problems.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory problems, pain or persistent pressure on the chest, confusion, walking disorders, and the face or mouth of blue; it is recommended to seek treatment if these symptoms are present.
Abnormal; symptoms in the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, nose sneeze or throat pain can be observed.
Symptoms in the stomach such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
Other cases in China showed only chest stress and heart attacks.
In some cases, the disease may continue to be pneumonia, various organs not working with death.
This is known as a period of rebirth.
The COVID-19 outbreak period is usually five to six days but can start from the second or fourteenth.
97.5<0x25> of people who show symptoms will show up within 11.5 days after infection. Rippi shows that not all infected people will show symptoms.
The role of these unintended spreaders in infections is still unclear, however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The ratio of unintended symptoms is currently unknown and is being investigated, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting 20<0x25> of all confirmed cases continued to show no symptoms in hospitals.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include people who showed no symptoms in their daily cases on 1 April; 166 people infected that day, 130 (78<0x25>) did not show any symptoms at the time of testing.
Coconuts and saliva can have high levels of viruses,
Speaking out loud causes more drops than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering can lead to drops up to 4.5 meters (15 ft).
Although the virus cannot normally be transmitted in the air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that it is possible to infect through air particles and air collections on the routes outside people's rooms contain positive samples of the RNA virus.
Some medical procedures such as injection of tumors and heart and lung regeneration (CPR) can cause asthma hydration to be converted into air and thus lead to dysfunction through the air.
Although there is concern that it can be spread through excrement, this risk is believed to be low. The virus can be highly contagious when people show symptoms; although infections are possible before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it is unclear how the disease spreads, one person generally infects two or three others, the virus stays over the spread for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on the cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99<0x25> copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and heat.
Soap and sanitary medicine are also ideal if used properly; soap products weaken the protective layer of viral oil, disabling its strength, as well as providing it for skin and other areas.
Other toxicities, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (operative chemistry), do not work properly. In a study in Hong Kong study, samples of saliva were taken on average two days after the initial hospitalization began.
Among six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral rate and the sixth patient showed the highest viral rate on the second day of testing.
Acute respiratory disorder, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a new coronavirus of severe respiratory problems,
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus appear in coronavirus-related viruses in nature.
Outside of the human body, the virus is consumed by a seventh of home use, which breaks down its immune tube. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the natural SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the virus reaches viral cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting 2 enzymes (ACE2), which are most commonly found in the II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses special glycoproteins of areas known as "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the cell.
A severe heart injury was found in 12<0x25> of people infected and hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is prevalent in severe illness.
The levels of heart disease symptoms are high, due to the inflammatory response system and the immune system during the development of the disease, but severe heart wall injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly visible in the heart and are involved in cardiovascular activity.
Most heart rate cases (31<0x25>) and blood clots beginning to freeze in the vein (25<0x25>) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with poor prediction. A study of the bodies of people who died from COVID-19 has undergone special changes due to the disease (DAD), and lymphatic lymphocytes.
Although SARS-COV 2 has ACE-2 growth indicating cells stretching your body's surfaces in the respiratory system, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hypainflammation.
Specifically, T cells derived from GM-CSF viruses have shown to be consistent with the use of monocytes that provide IL-6 for inflammation and causes severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Rare skin disease has also been reported during blood tests.
WHO has published several protocols for diagnosis of the disease.
A common method of testing is in a research laboratory to investigate gene availability (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually carried out on respiratory samples obtained by a nasal clinical trial sample; however; a cosmetic and saliva sample can also be used.
Results are generally found within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples that took two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to separate the coronavirus strain from a series of genes so that laboratories around the world could develop tests to provide a variety of DNA samples to detect the virus's infection.
As of April 2020, antibodies (which can detect active infections and if a person was previously infected) were ongoing but not widely used.
Chinese testing experience has shown accuracy is only 60<0x25> to 70<0x25>.
The FDA in the United States approved the first handling trial on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines issued by the University of Wuham University of Zhongnan Hospital recommended methods to diagnose infections based on clinical characteristics and the risk of epidemiological diseases.
Two soft glass and many metals with side parts used to detect asthma strands,
The presence of Subpleural in quantity, negative pathways (the density associated with the lobular and different alveolasis), and a combination can be seen as a progressive disease.
Few data are available on small wounds and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main findings of the diagnosis are:
Eye examination: plaurisy, pericarditis, lung filled with liquid instead of air and water concentration in tissues and lung air positions.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Lower pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and the structure of large cells.
High pneumonia: special changes in the lungs due to a disease (DAD) containing liquid from the lungs.
DAD is diagnosed with acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hiposemia.
Healing pneumonia: the supply of liquid in kidney gaps and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: major problems where proteins that regulate blood clotting become more active (DIC);
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding overcrowded areas, washing your hands with soap and water regularly for at least 20 seconds, practicing good coughing manners and avoid touching unwashed eyes, nose or mouth and hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using it within the elbow if no tissue is found.
Hand sanitation after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC has recommended using facial masks in the public environment, to prevent infections from a person showing symptoms. Social isolation strategies aim to reduce contact with infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces; preventing travel and banning large public gatherings.
Remote stay guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no known vaccine to perform COVID-19 prevention work. Although no vaccine is expected until 2021 as soon as possible, a key component of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the outbreak rate, known as “reducing infections”
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the dirt appears on their hands, before eating and after sneezing, coughing or sneezing.
It is more recommended to use hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent of antibiotics, but it is when soap and water are not available. In areas where hand sanitizers containing antibiotics are not readily available, WHO provides an internal production formula.
In these structures, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial syndromes from alcohol; it is not "a substance used for handheld labels"
Gliseroli is added as a substance used to keep things moist.
People are treated with care, which may include using liquid as a treatment, oxygen support, and treating other affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a normal mask.
External respiratory device (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory problems, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Physical hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Treatments can be used for those showing mild symptoms at the beginning of the infection. WHO and China’s National Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of people hospitalized due to COVID-19.
Emergency physicians and lung doctors in the United States have included medical recommendations from various organizations as a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some experts recommended paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first option to use.
Care should be taken to reduce viral infections, especially in health care environments when performing procedures that can provide aerosols, such as the installation of tubes or the transmission of air by hand to the patient.
For healthcare professionals treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing a person in the Air Infection Room (AIIR) as well as using conventional air-conditioning, air-conditioning and air-conditioning warnings.CDC provides guidance on how to use Self-Defense Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended clothing is: PPE garlic, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved masks to be used under the Emergency Use Permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but their effectiveness against specific biological particles is not guaranteed for undisclosed use.
While masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face barriers, or as a last resort, home-made masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not too severe to require air-conditioning or replacements, but are required for a large percentage of cases.
A type of respiratory aid for people with Covid-19-related respiratory problems is being studied in hospitals, with some evidence that keeping a tube can be avoided by a high-voltage ventilator.
It is unclear whether one of these two results in similar benefits for people who are very sick.
Some doctors prefer to use ventilators when available because this technique reduces lubricant particles compared to air conditioning device at a higher rate. severe cases are common in older people (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have adequate personal beds, which reduces the ability of the health system to handle the sudden COVID-19 incidents that are too severe to require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5<0x25> were admitted to emergency units, 2.3<0x25> needed respiratory aid and 1.4<0x25> died.
In China, about 30<0x25> of people admitted to hospitals due to COVID-19 were eventually admitted to a emergency room.
It is becoming more and more difficult to use air-conditioning because severe respiratory disorders (ARDS) occur with COVID-19 and are becoming more and more difficult to increase oxygen.
High-pressure air transmission equipment and high-pressure PEEP are required to increase oxygen emissions and still reduce the risk of lung injury associated with the air-conditioning
High PEEP may not be available in old ventilation containers.
Probable medical research began in January 2010, and several antiviral drugs are being tested for clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to have good results.
Although new drugs can be developed by 2021, a number of prescription drugs have already been approved for other uses or are being tested further.
Antiviral drugs can be used by people with severe disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in clinical trials of effectiveness and safety. The FDA has issued temporary contraceptives as experimental treatment in cases where the person’s life has been seriously threatened or immediately.
He has not reviewed the clinical research needed to prove that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app and addressed the outbreak.
Users are asked to have their name and identification number.
The software can detect "the person you were closest to" by dismissing the diagnosis data and thus be able to detect potential risks and infections.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If a potential danger has been detected, the software not only recommends isolate itself, but also informs local health officials. Large mobile data analysis, facial recognition technology, mobile phone monitoring and machine awareness are used to track infected and connected people in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the data of people believed to have the coronavirus.
This action was taken to ensure that they were isolated and to protect those who could be contacted by infected civilians.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared general telephone area data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia spread facial recognition technology to identify quarantine lawbreakers.
Giulio Gallera, Italian regional health commissioner, said he had been informed by mobile phone providers that "40<0x25> of the people are still just walking".
The German government conducted an event to develop software with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, also called for innovative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects or fear of infections themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connoe as saying, "Increasing isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic hygiene is the best way to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have fewer or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory illnesses such as flu.
Chronic mild disease usually heals within two weeks, where people with severe or severe illnesses can take three or six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 based on data compared to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. For some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In people who are seriously affected, COVID-19 can rapidly increase into a chronic respiratory disease (ARDS) that leads to a complete insufficiency of breathing, an oral infection or a variety of ovarian inability to function.
Problems related to COVID-19 include bacterial disease, abnormal blood clots, heart damage, kidney and liver damage.
Unusual blood clotting, particularly an increase in prothrombin, has been described in 6<0x25> of those admitted to hospital due to COVID-19, where unusual kidney function is observed in 4<0x25> of this group.
Approximately 20-30<0x25> of people with COVID-19 show high levels of liver enzymes (high levels of liver damage)
According to the report, the average time between symptoms seen and death was ten days, and five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to an emergency room had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average time to show early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full dose of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), men had a death rate of 2.8<0x25> whereas women had a death rate of 1.7<0x25>.
Histopathology tests of post-mortem pulmonary samples show some changes in the structure of the lungs and severe respiratory syndrome in all lungs.
Significant changes were also observed in the cells of the fetus.
The pulmonary image is similar to acute respiratory disorder (ARDS).
In 11.8<0x25> of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage was observed by increased levels of troponin or heart attack.
According to the March data from the United States, 89<0x25> of those admitted to hospital had previous conditions. Access to medical resources and the socio-economic conditions of the region could also affect the possibility of dying.
Estimates of deaths due to this situation vary due to those regional differences, but also due to problems with specific methods.
Lower mortality rates can lead to overestimated death rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of people previously infected may mean that the current mortality rate has been ignored.
Smokers were more likely to have symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need specific treatment or die compared to non-smokers. Questions have been asked about how long the disease will be.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that the rate decreased to 20 to 30 percent in lung capacity in people recovering from the disease, pulmonary tests showed damage to the organ.
This can also lead to health problems that remain after a severe illness.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infections provided adequate and long-term immunity to those who recovered from the disease.
The immune system is seen as likely, according to the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there are reports of cases where people have recovered from COVID-19 and have been accompanied by positive tests of the coronavirus in the future.
These incidents are believed to be increasing incidence of long-term infections rather than new infections.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated from animals, through transmission infections.
Its origin is unknown but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection was caused by infections from one person to another.
A study of the first 41 confirmed COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed the first date on which the symptoms began is 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported that the first visible symptoms were on December 8, 2019.
Several steps are commonly used to measure the mortality rate.
These numbers vary depending on the region and time and are affected by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, medical options, the duration since the first outbreak occurred and the characteristics of populations such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO handed out ICD-10 emergency diagnosis codes that are U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections in laboratories and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 clinically diagnosed or biologically tested cases without a specific incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll rate is 6.9<0x25> (153,822/2,240,191) to 17 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the region. Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people diagnosed who die from disease, and the mortality rate of infection (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected people (identified and unidentified) who die from disease.
These statistics are not time-consuming and follow a number of people from infection to case-resolution.
Although not all infected people get antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give a description of the number of people infected.
In the center of the explosion in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7<0x25>) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread at Canivali festivals, and the spread of young people, resulting in fewer deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be formally listed in this way.
Moreover, the German health system has not failed.
In the Netherlands, about 3<0x25> may have antibodies, as measured from blood donors.
69 (0.004<0x25> of the population) have been confirmed dead due to COVID-19.
The effects of this disease and its mortality rate are different for both men and women.
In a study conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The biggest risk is for men aged 50 and over, with the gap between men and women approaching each other at just 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8<0x25> for men and 1.7<0x25> for women.
The exact causes of this gender diversity are unknown, but the genetic and behavioral factors may be the cause.
Gender-related immunity differences, the rate of women smoking decreases and men have more than one disease such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may be contributing to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57<0x25> of infected people were men and 72<0x25> of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track data related to the gender of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viruses such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect different men and women.
A large percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that CO represents coronavirus, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 was the first year the outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic area (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, according to international recommendations on giving a name aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the coronavirus of asthma 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "virus that causes COVID-19" in public communication.
Disease and viruses are commonly known as "coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly known as the "coronavirus virus" and the "coronavirus virus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO proposed that 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov respiratory disorders as temporary names of the virus and the disease in line with the 2015 guidelines against using sites such as virus and disease names,
Official names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-12 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to the limitations of capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers publish healthcare equipment such as nasal cleaning and ventilation parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilation tube, and the seller was unable to deliver in due course, the local seller manufactured and printed the 100 needed tubes in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, false theories, false information and lack of information emerged in relation to the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other diseases and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
Research failed to find evidence of the virus to double itself on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no vaccine or vaccine to treat the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines is being carried out by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "United Test" to assess the treatment effect of the four existing antiviral drugs with a strong commitment to effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but various organizations promote various vaccines.
The original functions of SARS-CoV are used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are being investigated.
First, researchers aim to create a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of viruses like this, whether inactive or dead, aims to increase the immune response of the human body to new COVID-19 infections.
The second technique, the vaccine section, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system feel certain parts of the virus.
In the SARS-CoV-2 case, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus insert the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third method is for the immunization of the nucleic acid (the DNA or RNA vaccines, a new vaccine-processing technique).
Experimental vaccines from any of these techniques will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with 4 volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless gene code copied from the disease. Improvements based on antibodies have been proposed as a possible challenge for the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials that are ongoing as of April 2020.
Seven tests were assessing the preliminary treatment of malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Correctional antiviral drugs include most of China's research, and phase III trials in several countries due to reports before the end of April.
A comprehensive review of the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines is underway, starting in April 2020. Several antiviral drugs are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined.
There is evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical progress was seen in patients treated with remdesivir use.
Phase III clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, originally used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, using preliminary results.
However, there is a call for inspection of the researchers.
The Korean and Chinese Health Authority recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, finds that using the dose twice is extremely dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to voluntarily physicians treating people with COVID-19. The guidelines of the Chinese 7th edition also include the use of interferon, ribavirin or umphonovir to prevent COVID-19.
Preliminary data show high doses of ribavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in a glass container.
Nitazaxonide has been recommended for further live research after showing a low concentration restriction of SARS-CoV-2. Research has shown that an increase in protein preparation using transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CpV-2 entry through contact with ACE2 receptors.
Research on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drugs whether or not the azithromycin cell has a significant deficiency that has prevented medical professionals from adopting this treatment without further research. Oseltamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in fertility and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The presence of cytokine protein can lead to complex conditions in the later levels of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-inflammatory properties of cytokine. Tocilizumab is included in the medical instructions of the Chinese National Health Commission after a limited study was completed.
It passes through the 2nd phase of randomized tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results for people with severe disease.
Combined with a blood test of fertilizer serum to detect an overdose of cytokines, it is intended to deal with similar effects, which are considered the cause of death among infected individuals.
Resistance to interleukin-6 receptors was approved by the FDA due to a later study of the treatment of cytokine overdose caused by a variety of causes, CAR cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no systematic, controlled evidence that tocimizumab is the best CRS treatment.
Transferring published and saturated antibodies produced by the body's immune systems of people recovering from COVID-19 to people in need is being investigated as an inactive immune system for the non-vaccinated body.
This technique was tested on SARS with incomplete results.
Virus balancing is the expected step-by-step method by which an inactive antibodies can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques, such as cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis dependent on antibodies, are possible.
Other non-functional treatments of the immune system, for example, using synthetic antibodies of the same type of cloning are created.
The production of a recovery drug vaccine, consisting of a liquid part of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies that are specialized to the virus, can be increased due to rapid synthesis.
Coronavirus, a group of closely related diseases
