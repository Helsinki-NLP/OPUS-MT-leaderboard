Welsh councillors are concerned about 'appearing as puppets'
There is concern among some delegates after the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This is due to a plan to change the name of the council to the Legislative Assembly of Wales.
Members of the Council from all political angles are concerned that the move will lead to ridicule.
A Lebanese delegation said that his group was concerned that the name was "equal to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means fool and pwp means excrement.
Plaid's wing spokesman said the group was generally "unhappy" and has proposed an alternative name.
A Conservative member said his group was "clear in thought" about the name change, but said they were the words of an abbreviation of the MWP to Karagosi.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Council panel, which is currently enacting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision regarding any keyword in terms of how the Council Members are actually referred to will certainly belong to the delegates themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh council the power to change its name.
In June, the Panel published the results of consultations with the public on proposals that were broadly supported by referencing the council as the Parliament of Wales.
In relation to the position of Council Members, the Panel favored either the Welsh House Members or WMP, but the MWP option received more support in public consultations.
As it turns out, the Council members are proposing alternative options, but efforts to reach an agreement may be challenging for the Executive Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on change within a few weeks.
The law on change will include other changes regarding how the council works, including rules to remove the eligibility of the Council Member and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the Council will vote in the final vote on the name they will be called when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote for a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia."
This popular vote was planned to resolve a decade-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The authorities in the city of Athens insist that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim to their territory and has continued to oppose its request to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of a direct referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of name is needed so that they can join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells go silent as the churches in Harlem pass through Chagamoto
"Historically, the elders I have spoken to say that there was a church and a bar in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's no one."
He said the absence of a bar is understandable.
"People talk to each other in different ways," he said.
"It's like a neighborhood where people meet on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders also expect, "and soon they will return to their original state."
Churches, he added, may be converted into large floors with private homes that will not help keep the remaining reserves in the neighborhood.
"A large number of people who buy private homes in these buildings will be white," he said, "and thus this will accelerate the closure of these churches in general because it is unlikely that people in these flats will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white allies before Harlem became the city of the Black Community in 1870 and renamed St. Martin a decade later.
Indigenous Methodists who were white left in the 1930s.
Members of the black community who were sharing in the surrounding area took over the buildings.
St. Martin became less black allies under Priest John Howard Johnson, who led the strike of retailers at 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or collaborate with black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when the members of the Johnson Cathedral made plans to rebuild it, they authorized the establishment of the area of a keyboard bell set or automatic method.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Johnson Priest and successor of St. Martin, called a set of bells "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played a set of bells in July called it another name: "Cultural Treasure" and "an unchangeable historical element."
An expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the world's first set of bells played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the area of the largest set in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not look for someone else to replace him.
The bells played in St. Martin for the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a complex way, some of which were brought in by church leaders, and others by the bishopric.
The governing body in the parish, comprising church administrators, wrote to the diocese in July concerned that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some of the participants complained of lack of transparency from the diocese.
Papa injures 13-year-old boy while diving to trap a tree in California
The pope raided a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving to trap a string in California on the first day of the rope season, officials said.
The invasion occurred shortly before 1:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday mornings when he heard a boy screaming for help and then rowed with a group to help him jump into the water.
Hammel said that the first time he thought it was just the excitement of kicking a rope, but "I found out that he was screaming, 'I'm hurt!
I've been killed!"
His shoulder skeleton had come out," Hammel said, discovering it soon after he reached the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of the pope who made the invasion is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that the pope had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but it was not identified as a endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons.
Giles suggested that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury wants to fight Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams using a series of aesthetic styles with staff who are professional assistants.
As a major part of planning to enter the beauty market worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion sales and home appliances decline, large-scale beauty ranges will be tested in 11 stores across the country and introduced in more stores next year if this step is successful.
Investments in beauty have come as supermarkets are looking for ways to fill up shelf spaces that were used to keep television, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the delivery of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing editions from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more spaces with locations that are branded similar to those in stores such as Boots.
This supermarket is also re-launching a variety of cosmetic products so much of the products benefit non-flavored people - something that is heavily pressured by young buyers.
In addition, the retail perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will conduct a test at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the purchase preferences of daily food products on a small scale in a nearby retail store means the supermarkets have to make more effort to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive at Sainsbury's, said the store would look more like unit stores while a chain of supermarkets trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been establishing small Argos stores in hundreds of shops and has also established some Habitats stores since it purchased the two-year-old series, which says it has increased the sales of vegetable and made the customer service more profitable.
The initial attempt at the supermarket to revive its beauty and medicine units was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union broke up after a dispute over how to share revenues from pharmaceutical stores in its supermarkets.
A new strategy was introduced after Sainsbury sold its 281 store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is said that Lloyds will contribute to the program, in addition to more luxury brands for face and skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and status of our beauty products series to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also worked with professionals to provide advice.
Our various brands have been designed to meet all the demands and environments that are attractive and the right place means that we have now become an exciting place for beauty products where there is a lot of competition for original ways to make purchases."
Peter Jones is "depressed" after Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragoons star Peter Jones was left "infuriated" after television presenter Holly Willoughby resigned from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with his fashion branding business to focus more on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have enough time for their True brand of home products and spare parts.
The two businesses were connected to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old broadcaster of the show, This Morning, wrote on Instagram announcing his departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star Den Peter Jones in shock for withdrawing from their prestigious fashion brand brand the last minute - to focus on her new prestigious contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "exasperated" when the celebrity television personality admitted at a very tense meeting on Tuesday at his business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business plans - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant he would not have enough time to deal with their Truely home equipment and spare parts.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, wrote on Instagram announcing that he was leaving Truely's business, Jones flew from England to one of his vacation homes.
The source said: "Truely it was one of Holly's most attention-grabbing things.
It was his permanent future that would enable him to continue for more than a decade to come.
His decision to leave was a shock to everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the time of the inauguration was very near.
There are warehouses full of goods at Marlow Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's broadcaster, who is all the most reliable in the UK, could cost the business millions of dollars from massive investments in products including rivers, candles, clothing and household appliances and potentially delayed launches.
It can lead to the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truely with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple goes on vacation with Jones who owns 40<0x25> in Baldwin's TV production plant.
Willoughby is expected to become an M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity show.
A source near Jones said last night that "We couldn't comment on his business activities."
"A love story" and "We love each other"
He lamented the criticism he would get from the news agencies by commenting on what others would consider to be "inappropriate for the president" and by praising the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump become so disillusioned?
Trump said in his sarcastic voice "a news reporter".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He suggested that Kim preferred a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June to be praised by Trump as a major milestone in North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
Nuclear disarmament talks have been postponed.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore, prominent North Korean ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North Korean nation had not seen an "equivalent action" from the United States for the initial steps to disarm North Korea.
Instead, he said, the United States has developed barriers aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump had a positive attitude in his speech.
"We are doing well in North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight North Korea.
Millions of people lost their lives.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said his efforts to improve co-operation with Kim had brought good results – to stop rocket trials, to help with the release of hostages and to help with the reinstatement of American troops' bodies.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing out to the crowd ahead of him.
Indonesia's tsunami and tsunami hit the island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10<0x25> of Lombok's population had been evacuated, no national disaster was declared, a condition required to trigger international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they don't ask for international help, and that's a challenge". Mrs. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children team together to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see where international organizations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Due to the frequent earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country remains in a state of disarray due to natural disasters.
Although residential huts as a result of the tsunami effect have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found in coastal areas.
The actual lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning was there, may have contributed to disaster.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make the transport activities confusing.
A hospital ship set in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster area.
President Joko Widodo used the deteriorating infrastructure in Indonesia as the center of your elected campaigns, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railway construction.
But the financial deficit has become a challenge for Mr. Joko's government as he approaches next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also coping with pressure from industrialist groups, where many Muslim allies have had a conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the streets, with swords, bows and arrows and other heavy weapons.
Note: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge beats Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from <0x58>herdan Shaqiri with about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate while his team was behind with 1-0 goals.
He moved the ball to the left foot before lifting the striker to the upper end of the gate.
The ball flew over the defensive area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and ended up in the net.
"It was just trying to be in that position, to reach the ball and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as best they can, so I tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw one of them coming, and I didn't even think much about it, and I just took a shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the break after scoring a 25-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues team striker hit the heel and returned it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before turning around in the middle of the field and running on the Liverpool side of the gate.
Kovacic gave a pass to another player and surrounded the opponent and received it in the middle of the field.
Then he hit a cedar that enabled Hazard to head into the box.
Hazard accelerated the guards and scored on the other end of the gate with a left foot shot against Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group matches at 9pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the Europa League at 9 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the disaster agency said earlier on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the ruins of buildings damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday, causing waves of up to 20 feet long, organizational spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, was filled with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for alleged murder after a woman was stabbed and killed
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside on the morning of the wake.
The 44-year-old was found with a knife wound at Grayson Mews in John Street, with a 32-year-old man being arrested for alleged murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard anything about the incident.
Intelligence Manager Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything he suspected of contacting us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is relevant to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and was inside the building.
This morning, a friend of mine came to the scene to ask questions about the woman's whereabouts.
Investigations are underway and police say they are in the process of informing the woman's family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has now tried to enter his home but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn't say anything when he realized what had happened.
Residents are now told it may take several hours before being allowed to enter the building.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came into the room crying.
He continues to repeat the words "very angry."
At 8 p.m., police cars were inside the building and another car was out.
Several officers stood inside the apartment and followed the floors.
Anyone with information is asked to send a personal message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers without identifying themselves via 0800 555 111 and refer to the 247th anniversary of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes a recent reminder of the crisis of 'rewrite history'
Its removal will be an eligible right for its Taliban-like destruction to British multicultural and religious arts carried out by its elite Puritan allies.
But the Cromwell Community described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a scam" and "to respond to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It would be inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's model outside Westminster Castle would have been targeted.
The act of destroying models in the British civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst Cromwell could have been blamed for was the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the past century.
The impressive representation of Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft to Cromwell is evidence of 19th century views and part of the history of a man whom many believe still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is revered by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary advocate due to external pressure, a situation that for him was the source of royal leadership.
All of this is an accurate representation of the topic of the ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the wars of the mid-17th century have laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is an individual recognized to represent one of the opposing groups.
His success as a Guardian Lord also deserves to be celebrated and celebrated."
A chinese man kills and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified by the last name "Yuan," was found dead with a badly affected vein in a blood clot near a pork shed in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig room on May 20, 2005 in <0x58>ining province of Qinghai, China.
He was said to have traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered the door of a neighboring pig hut was open.
He said there was a man in the house who had blood in his mouth.
Investigations confirmed that the <0xC2><0xA3>550-pound pig had scratched and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," the cousin, referred to his first name as "Wu," said, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent him from invading another person, while police gathered evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market mammals are reportedly negotiating to compensate for his death.
Although rare, pig invasion conditions have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig invaded a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing <0xC2><0xA3>650 pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife shocked him and fled.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but can be "a stimulus."
"They were just playing.
They're funny, and they want to know... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rains across the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over more static waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and southwestern the United States in the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a wind speed of 85 mph, Typhoon 1 at 11 a.m. East hour on Sunday, and was seen 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, pressure from the atmosphere has begun to accumulate over the Pacific Ocean and to the east to the West Coast of the United States.As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to push tropical humidity to the north-west of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday
Then, the tropical humidity that begins to interfere with the imminent pressure of the atmosphere will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the future.
In the interior, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will result in sudden flooding, mud slides and potential landfalls in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation levels to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in one place, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that rainfall levels are 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, mostly in Arizona.
Devastating flooding can occur due to worsening conditions due to the rising tropical rainfall conditions.
It would be very dangerous to go out into the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rainfall.
Deep rain can cause canyons to become large rivers and thunderstorms will produce strong winds and scattered dust.
The surrounding atmosphere will bring heavy rainfall to some parts of the coast of Southern California.
Over half a inch of rainfall may occur, which may result in a small slope of mud and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the area.
Some of the tropical rainfall will begin in Arizona later on Sundays and Mondays, before the rains spread further later on Mondays and Tuesdays.
There will be a lot of rain on the 4th of July.
October may have high temperature changes throughout the United States as the Arctic temperature decreases, but areas in the tropics will continue to have moderate temperatures.
This sometimes leads to sudden temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of sudden diversity in temperatures throughout the United States on Sunday.
There are approximately 20 degrees Celsius temperature differences between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the approaching summer will try to accumulate and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to be warm at the beginning of October and spread to 80 degrees from the Southern Tambare to the Northwest.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will weigh 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show a high probability of extreme temperatures in the eastern United States by the half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's case
More than 20 million people watched the overwhelming evidence on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment reportedly occurring in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular sessions to highlight the final stage of Friday's events: an agreement carried out by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is 100<0x25> sure that Kavanaugh caught him in secret while he was drunk and tried to strip him at a high school ceremony.
Kavanaugh, giving an empathetic witness, said he was 100<0x25> sure that it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have been observed by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was counting average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available from other networks that broadcast, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's organization usually has the challenge of counting the people they watch in the office.
To put this in the right perspective, it is an audience equal to the spectators of a football match or the College Training Awards.
Fox News, whose commentators have been actively involved in Kavanaugh's selection, led all networks to an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day trial, Nielsen said.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The desire continued after the trial.
Flake was the main theme in the case on Friday.
After this average Republican official issued a statement that he would be supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras in the morning on Friday while attempting to climb the elevator to attend a Court Committee hearing.
He stood down for a few minutes while being chastised, an incident that was shown live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?
He was told, "You have strength when many women do not have strength."
Flake said that his office had made a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, that he would have much to say in the committee's case.
The broadcasting networks and cable were all streaming live hours later, while the Court Committee was voting to further Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do so conscientiously that the FBI could investigate allegations against the electorate next week, something that few Democrats have been arguing.
Flake was to some extent persuaded by talks with his friend, the Democrat Senator. Chris Coons.
After discussions with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was strong, because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI over allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused opponents of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to withdraw from the European Union for "playing politics" with Britain's future and discredited national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Summit in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near her on the newspaper's front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed her attacks on her plan known as Chequers for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect each other's tariffs is "empty."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for the second level of murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the war.
Police found glasses from the attack site and said they found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, the WAFB station, a CBS partner, said.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
His salary is <0x24>350,000, the lawyer reported.
East Baton Rouge's death investigator's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death is a headshot injury in the neck.
The department congratulates Louisiana State Police, a criminal police laboratory, Southern University police and locals for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the jurisdiction of local law for "actively and fairly enforced."
Sims was 20 years old.
The striker was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 in hitting the ball in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team had been "very affected" and "stunned" by Wayde's death.
"It's something that's always bothering people," he said.
Volcanic eruptions over Mexico City
Explosions from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the neighbourhoods of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity within the crater and recorded 183 times the emissions of gas and ash for more than 24 hours.
The station was tracking a lot of thunderstorms and thunderstorms.
Images on social media showed thin ash covering car mirrors in neighboring Mexican city areas such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geologists have discovered an increase in activity on a volcano located 45 miles (720 km) south-east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the voting freedom ceremony
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after liberals protested against protesters as thousands joined protests to mark the first year of Katalunya's independence vote.
A group of protesters wearing puppets in favor of segregation blocked by the police beat them with eggs and threw them in powder color, resulting in dark dust clouds on the streets that would normally have many tourists.
The violence also occurred later that day as police used their staff to confront the fighting.
For more than a few hours the separatist groups who were saying "no forget, no forgiveness" confronted the united protesters who were saying, "Uspinia always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries found in protests, local media reported.
Anxiety remains high in the free-run area a year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but celebrated by separatists.
Voters voted largely to gain independence, although the number of candidates was low while the anti-separation candidates neglected to vote significantly.
According to the Kitatalunya authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region, causing violent violence.
Liberal groups had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to support the national police.
Protests continued but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist demonstration with his wife said he was no longer optimistic about Katalunya's prospects for independence.
"Last year we lived in the best time of our lives.
"I saw my parents crying because they were able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a significant victory in the last regional elections in December, Kakalunyan independence movements have failed to maintain pace in this year with many more well-known leaders in exile voluntarily or in detention awaiting trial for a referendum and a later release notice.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic recording protests supporting police on his phone, said the conflict had been caused by politicians from both sides.
"Anxiety is growing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in a pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for a seat in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European Parliament's elections is the best way to refuse a reversal of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga goal gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston's elevated ladder surprised the Rangers by leading to Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the club Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's side split the results between both teams as Gary Holt's team moved to second place equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains without a win in the away matches in the Premier League this season and will face Hearts leaders, who are in front of them for eight points, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers will be the Rapid Vienna hosts in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston has increased the number of matches they have not won to be six on the bridge, where head coach Holt has not yet failed since taking over Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed a chance against non-smokers
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead long before the kickoff, with their straight attacking game causing Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but missed targeting his skating that went ahead of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only hit the ball out after he stepped in to meet the headball from Craig Halkett.
The locals didn't seem to worry and allowed Rangers to own the game, knowing that they could harass the visitors with a puppy mipra.
And that's how they were able to set the goal.
The Rangers were penalized for a punch and Livingston struggled to get a break, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined and gave Menga a chance, who touched and scored from the middle of the box.
At the time, the Rangers had controlled the possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home team's defense and gatekeeper Liam Kelly was not disturbed for a long period of the game,
The style continued in the second period, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his skull.
Scott Pittman was barred from scoring by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow landed the ball after another liveston game.
The raids continued to wreak havoc on Livingston's team's box and continued to be eliminated, while two penalties - after Halkett's defeating reserve player Glenn Middleton, and the other in connection with holding the ball by hand - were ignored.
'Wonderful' from Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont's BBC Scots at Tony Macaroni Stadium
It's a great job and a good result for Bennett.
In reality, they had a good game and continued to exceed expectations and keep climbing up the table.
Their playing style and team has not changed much since returning to the Premier League, but many compliments go to Holt in the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed largely, well-maintained a more organized defense fort, while Menga gave them regular operations to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the entire match.
The Rangers, however, missed the motivation.
Just as they've been good at times under Gerrard, they were under those standards.
They missed the last touch in the gate - only once they were able to create a chance to score in the home team's stronghold - and that's a challenge for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a different reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at restoring relations between the two NATO allies.
They have differed on issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's access to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a barrier for a crowd of 25,000 people not to be gathered in front of the mosque, but many supporters rose up to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-legged protests point to a division over the president's attitude which is seen as a hero to some German Turks and criticized by others as a dictator.

Long Lartin Prison: Six officers detained in riots
Six prison officials have been injured in violence at a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The riot occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 3:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
Experts "Tornado" has been brought in to deal with the violence, which involves eight inmates and is controlled in a prison horn.
The officers were treated from minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Experimental training workers in prison have been brought in to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated with minor injuries.
We do not support violence in our prisons and it is clear that those involved will be taken to the police and could be extended to prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, protest officials were called to prison to deal with a massive disturbance in which workers were attacked by table gambling balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and Hurricane Floods (Summer Areas Can Benefit)
It's not uncommon for tropical depression to occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what can happen early next week when the remaining forces of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Western Desert leading to the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has stated on Twitter that "10 tropical cyclones have maintained a storm and pressure deficit within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as low levels of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other Western Desert areas including Great Basin Rockies are more likely to get 1 to 2 inches and less likely to get up to 4 inches.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa can be a blessing because the region is drought-stricken.
While flooding is a major cause of concern, some of these rains can be beneficial because the South West is experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring. just over 40<0x25> of Arizona experience at least a severe drought, the second highest type," weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to land through the area of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday mornings and a maximum maximum of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and runs north for 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing static water in the Pacific and therefore its strength is declining.
Thus, it is expected to land in Mexico with the power of tropical storms during the day or evening of Monday.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6-inch rainfall is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and is likely to reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning on Tuesday as a drop in tropical pressure and then head up through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the Northwest Desert of Sonora and the United States. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
Rainfall is expected to result in sudden life-threatening floods and mud slopes in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton Attack: The arrest of four people who tried to commit murder
Three 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found to have been stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at 10:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was placed in a "firm" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, 18-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon Police and Somerset said.
Officials have asked anyone who may have been caught and recorded the incident by mobile phone to appear.
Trump says Kavanaugh was 'expressed, greedy and angry' by Democrats
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote is a vote to reject the brutal and terrifying methods of the Democrat Party," Trump said at a Wheeling, West Virginia summit.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "expressed by the greed and anger" of the Democrats during his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Parliament on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally rejecting claims from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the case about the woman's allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's intelligence and quality and courage" that day.
"The vote to verify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most corrupt minds of our time, a lawyer with a good record of public service," he told a crowd in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's nomination indirectly when he spoke of the importance of Republicans to come out to vote in the representative elections.
"Five weeks from now is one of the most important choices in our lives.
"I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to get good candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to "restricting and preventing."
The first important formal vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place before Friday, the GOP's chief deputy leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and the death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed, many were drowned when massive waves reached the shores, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a ceremony on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when six-foot (18 m) waves struck the ground at night and drowned many and destroyed and destroyed everything that was there.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the coast and did not immediately run away and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster prevention agency BNPB, said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it came with cars, logs, houses, it affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had flew across the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Some people planted trees to avoid the tsunami and saved their lives, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 stations in the city of Palau.
Aerial photographs provided by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops damaged, bridges were overthrown and sunk by a watered mosque.
Small earthquakes continued to be heard in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were heard in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is found at the end of the narrow pavilion may have led to an increase in the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the devastating situation as a "private" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. The bodies of some of the victims were found stuck in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others had been missing.
Nugroho said the injuries and damage could be the largest offshore 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is near the core of the earthquake.
The communication was "completely disabled without notice" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that volunteers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a disaster, but it can be even worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not announcing that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived shortly after the warning was issued.
In a non-professional video shared on social media, a man in the upper floor of a building can be heard shouting the warnings of a approaching tsunami to people on the street.
Within a few minutes the waves reach the shore and carry buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis resulted in the loss of electricity in a broad area that cut communications near Palu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun to send freight aircraft and aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has only been opened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
The situation is very bad.
While the World Vision staff from Donggala had securely managed in the city of Palu, where the workers were sheltering in tents placed outside their offices, they went through the most devastating incidents along the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though relief teams began relief operations, some complained that foreign workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, funds, equipment and staff from overseas can only begin to enter if the pandemic declares nationality.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open up to get international help but there is still no such situation."
As the second night covered the city of Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who had been lost hoped that their loved ones would experience a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found out of a sewage pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days and her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian umbrella national team, had coached two of the umbrella jumpers who were lost for the Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Others stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a leader in the umbrella flying sea, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, hours after news about the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the community of participants in the umbrella jumping game, he had sent a WhatsApp message to competitors of Palu, who were participating in a coastal festival.
His message, however, showed one grey mark, rather than two blue marks.
"I think that means that the message has not been read," he said.
Thieves take <0x24>26,750 when filling an ATM in Levee's Newport
Thieves on Friday morning stole <0x24>26,750 from a Brink employee while filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to information released from Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was withdrawing money from the ATM in the entertainment hall and preparing to put more money into it, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "runn from the back of the Brink worker" and stole a bag of money that was intended to be shipped.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but the police did not specify the exact number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police via 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: An artist who changed his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed its name to Ye.
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and used the title as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
These changes take place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
She takes the place of singer Ariana Grande on the show, who regretted "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
Despite the fact that his current professional name is abbreviated, West has previously said that the term has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, referring to the name of his album and radio show producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm you, it's us.
It changed from Kanye, which means a unique person, and only Ye - to be an example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
It's more than just an example of how we are."
He is one of the most famous artists who changed their names.
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his nominations for Love and Brother Love.
The former West member, JAY-Z, has also been forced to use his name with a lower-level or lesser-length line.
Mexico’s Amlo pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country is nearing its 50th anniversary since the bloody massacres of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use an army to confront the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful protest in a building on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people while a left-wing student movement was taking root in Latin American countries.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening unpaid public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding of A.I.
As China continues to be more involved in creative thinking, the United States should double the amount of money it spends in research in that field, said AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various U.S. government units broadcast on AI, even though the United States generally lacks an official AI strategy.
At the same time, China launched its plan last year: and aims to be number 1 in the AI innovation by 2030.
"Twofolding the AI budget would be a good start, due to the situation that all other countries are behind beyond the United States and we are looking for new innovations in the AI," Lee said.
Double-double funding could double the chance that the next major AI successes will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he developed an AI system that won the American high-profile Othello player and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee agreed to the U.S. state-run technology competition as of the Robot Corporation in Deep Depth Research Plans and asked when the next competition would be, to help identify future specialists.
Researchers in the United States often have to work extra to get government aid, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes professional leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in the AI.
"I think green cards should be delivered directly to PhD students in the AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council released its Development Plan in False Mind in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in educational institutions as well as how the Natural Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of professional work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Co-operation Center in False Minds, which aims to engage industry partners and academics and the White House announced the formation of the Investigation Committee in False Mind.
And this month DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in AI Next plan.
For NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. law that sought to form the National Security Commission in Mental Fake has not progressed for several months now.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name
The Macedonians voted on a referendum on Sunday about the change of his name to the "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that could resolve a long-term conflict with Greece that blocked his bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim to its province and has opposed the country's request to be a member of NATO and EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents say the change will undermine the ethnic recognition of many of the Sulvonians in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and a negligence campaign has raised doubts as to whether the number of voters will reach the 50<0x25> required for a referendum to be accurate.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO membership with the EU and agree to an agreement with Greece?"
Followers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a guarantee that should be paid to be accepted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries formed due to Yugoslavia's disintegration.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonian youth so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because the move means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognized, enough members of parliament have said they will support the vote results to make it more serious.
Change of name will require support and two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of violations by 7 p.m.
However, the number of voters was only 16<0x25>, compared to 34<0x25> in the 2016 parliamentary elections while 66<0x25> of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country's action that will open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Stramunica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before Skopje's parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small platform and organizing seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
"We join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join voluntarily, not through the back door by pressure," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our respect.
If they don't want to sign us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia cooperation."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a 20<0x25> unemployment rate.
"I believe the majority will support because 80<0x25> of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said in a statement.
He said the result of "yes" would be "a proof of our future."
A poll poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in a referendum - less than the required level.
Another study, conducted by Macedonian televised Telma, found that 57<0x25> of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70<0x25> said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to fail the number of voters to be 50<0x25> with one vote.
Failure in the referendum will represent the first major blow to the Western-backed government policy since it took over power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero rounds the entire Brighton castle and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated Brighton's midfielder in a match that Manchester City won 2–0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the middle of the field and started the series.
He passed between Brighton's three defenders, before penetrating the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one week and then pushed the other faster at the corner of Brighton's gate box.
He then passed through his left side, and found Sterling.
The British striker used his first touch in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg around Brighton's gatekeeper Mathew Ryan and a slap in the right side of the net.
"Aguero faces some problems in his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We were lucky to have scored those goals at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues first control in the Premier League.
They were closed for 29 minutes.
Aguero received a ball into the Brighton area in the attack.
He hit a good cedar pass through the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before giving Sterling a pass to the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball into the net before starting to celebrate.
City are battling Hoffenheim in the Mabingw League group match at 6:55 pm Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a destroyer against. Rockies
With the Nationals already removed from the tournament, he had no other reasons to force another start.
But the most competitive Scherzer hopes to be a deterrent on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still serious consequences in the draw for the Rockies, who are proud to have one game they haven't played against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies won the chance to play the qualifying match by winning 5-2 against the National on Friday night, but are still looking for the first title in the bridge.
"Although we don't play to get anything, at least we can play a tough game based on the situation in Denver and the crowd and the other teams will be playing at the highest level at every level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I try to get into that situation?"
Nationals have not yet announced the players to start the game on Sunday, but they say they would like to allow Scherzer to drop the ball in the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, performed on Thursday and will be throwing in his rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-handed player has 18–7 runs and an average of 2.53 runs and 300 points to be eliminated in 220 2/3 runs this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation facing his electorate Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of Republicans appearing in the majority in the representative elections.
"All the successes we've achieved are at stake in November.
Five of the most important decisions in our lives.
"This is one of the big, big elections - I'm not running but in a different sense I'm really running and that's why I'm running around to pick good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrendous, horrendous group of Democrats, you see what they are doing right now.
And they have decided to take power by any means possible, you can see greed, corruption.
They don't care about people who hurt them, who wrong him in order to gain power and control, what they want is power and control, we can't give them."
He said the Democrats are committed to "resisting and preventing."
"And you can see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "a people of wrath and self-will, and of the transgressors and of the liars."
He cited a Senator's Court Committee member Dianne Feinstein under the name, which prompted the audience to criticize him.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you misrepresent the manuscript?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I waited one - that was the weakest language of the body - the worst language I've ever witnessed."
The church is no longer a church.
It doesn't tolerate free thought
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to remove me, it wasn't very surprising.
After all, I'm one in line for Lebanese MPs to be told that we don't want to - all by saying our thoughts.
My congressman Joan Ryan was treated in the same way because he stood up for his revolt against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal to get rid of me shocked me by the disapproval of Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of the importance of proper economic policy, regarding national security, on the European issue, it is imperceptible that the issues are similar to those that Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
A statement at the Leba summit in Nottingham East on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For more than eight years as a local Lebanese MP, Friday night GC meetings have been entirely included.
Unfortunately today, it did not resemble many meetings and the promise of politics "mildness, kindness" has long been forgotten if, in fact, it had begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not accepted in the Leba party and all opinions are taken well only if they are accepted by the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as my partner who I thought we were sharing the same political outlook he began to expect me to completely change my mind and take on positions that I would never have agreed with - whether it was about national security or one market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public - and no matter what I'm saying - what follows is insults on social media and attempts to get me to not be elected, to reject middle-wing politics, and to tell me that I shouldn't be part of the Leba party.
And it's not the situation I've been alone.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than others because the opinions directed to me are politically oriented.
I respect the skill and expression of my colleagues who face sexual or racial profanity every day but never give up.
One of the most frustrating things in today's politics is how abuse rates are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leba party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer an integrated church and with every debate of the "unfaithfulness" or change in the principles of selection, the party becomes much thinner in the individuality.
Over the past two years, I've had a lot of advice on being calm, not talking too much and saying "I'll be okay."
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Leba party 32 years ago as a school student, due to the motivation to be ignored by the Thatcher government that left my full school class almost to fall, I have struggled to fight for the best public services for those who need it most - whether it be a local councillor or a government minister.
I haven't changed my mind, even in the past.
No one in East Nottingham could have been confused about attitudes in policy and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all I will say is that as the country is about to leave the European Union’s popular Brexit, a move that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the Leba party leader.
But in fact one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for the citizens in my area, whether it be members of the Leba party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no amount of threats or political efficacy will prevent me from focusing on what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's unfinished team still ranks first on the table
Two attempts in the final may have altered to a certain extent the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr qualified to win in this highly anticipated tennis league match.
Now they are leading the table, a unique team that has not failed.
Ultimately, it was their best defense, as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far, and we haven't failed yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they used their positions better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, tied by Frazier Climi, put Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish team player Rory Hughes, presented for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of a multiplayer and Jason Baggot scored an unlocked try.
Climo added Ayr's lead to penalties, just before the break time, scored and then completed a solo attempt and made a score of 17-5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half with Patrick Anderson's attempt, tied by Baggot, reducing the lead by five points.
The game was then temporarily suspended after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was eliminated being carried and the game was re-established, Ayr extended his lead to Stafford McDowall's attempt, tied by Climi.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card again and again, Melrose took advantage of the opportunity to have one more player and tied it to Bruce Colvine's attempt, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for playing poorly for Climi without a ball and from a penalty line out, MacPherson scored a hit from Ayr.
Climo scored, as he was doing after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's skate and kicked Gregor Henry and scored a fifth try for the home team.
Star of the Still Game takes on a new role in the cafeteria industry
The star of Still Game Ford Kieran appears to enter the house industry after he was discovered to have been appointed as the director of a certified restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starring Jack Jarvis on the BBC show, which he is a writer and co-host of his longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nine series will be the final in the season and Kiernan seems to have another plan in life after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper alleged that Kiernan was expecting to be involved in a "very growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no port, hopes that the court will open the way to reach the Pacific Ocean
The crew patrols the maritime headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings light a blue flag like the sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are recorded saying: "The sea is ours for justice.
Restoration is a responsibility."
Throughout the portless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that it lost to Chile in the 19th century's resource crisis remains clear – just as the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
The prospects are perhaps the highest now for many years, with Bolivia waiting for a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia is fast, a spirit of unity and stability and really has the prospect of a positive outlook for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivians will look at the ICJ's decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will make a decision that accepts Bolivia's demands - after decades of relevant negotiations - will be forced to negotiate the move to give Bolivia a way to reach the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who faces fierce confrontations in next year's re-election - also has a lot to do with Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will make a decision that suits Bolivia - and that there will be very little change even if it decides so.
The Dutch-based agency has no authority to quote Chile to other countries, and said it could not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision of the ICJ will be made just six months after the final debate marking the case as "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And in addition to developing Bolivia's optimism, the past four years may have brought it back.
"The issue of sea access is being exploited by the current Bolivian regime," said Zárate.
Morales's political speech has ended Chile's remaining goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue negotiations, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decisions were too urgent.
Monday will give Bolivia "a wonderful opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 years of diversity for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in South America - was using the maritime issue as a political stream.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to realize that we need to move forward."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be possible unless it is believed in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never withdraw its nuclear weapons first if it could not have confidence in Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow the pledges made during a meeting in Singapore between opposition leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to re-establish a nuclear diplomacy that had not been successful for more than three months after a summit in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "small dream" to continue US sanctions and opposition to a statement ending the Korean War that will ever weaken the North.
Washington is afraid to accept the notice without Pyongyang first taking the necessary steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But there is serious doubt that Pyongyang is considering the withdrawal of weapons that the country considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to host a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris show modern headphones heading to the Fashion Stores near you
If you want to increase the concentration of your hats or completely block the sun, then you have found a solution.
Experts Valentino and Thom Browne launched superb headphones in their collection SS19 in a stage show that stunned them with creativity at the Style Week in Paris.
The hats that are difficult to create have attracted many on Instagram in this summer and these designers have provided these stylish hats to be used in the fashion platform.
Valentino's most impressive feature was a brown hat placed on a broad feather-like edge that covered the heads of models.
Other great materials include timber models, wizard's hat and even pineapple - but they are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also revealed amazing masks - as Halloween approaches.
Many colored masks had stitched beaks and resembled Hannibal Lecter than style masterpieces
One design resembled a skirt with a chip and glass, while the other resembled a melting ice cream cone.
And if you continue to have a great fashion statement - you're lucky.
Style viewers predict that large beetles can be on the way to a luxurious store near you.
The giant hats offer creativity in 'La Bomba', a stud hat with a two-foot-wide sleeve edge leading everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Label supporters created this complex hat that was released on social media made another high-quality innovation used in the fashion platform - a large-scale handbag using a swimwear model
The orange raffia package, set on the edge by a leather handle, was the most impressive in the SS19's Jacques 'La Riviera collections at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion specialist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing big hats and sleeve bags arrive in stores next summer - because the architect has brought a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore on the demand for large equipment."
John Edwards: Language skills are important for the international community
Scottish independent schools continue to maintain a record of professional proficiency and this has continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community efforts.
With an increase of more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland (known as SCIS), strive to provide an excellent level of service to students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, the professions they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can create and implement a special school curriculum, we see modern languages becoming increasingly popular with a preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his native language, that goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely on English only when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's test, we can see that language leads the league table with high scores in independent schools.
A total of 68<0x25> of students who learned foreign languages received a high score of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72<0x25> of students received the highest A score in the Mandarin language and 72<0x25> for those learning German, 69<0x25> for those learning French and 63<0x25> for those learning Spanish as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the essential skills that children and young people will need in their future.
Languages now, as a selected subject, are taken to the same level as STEM studies (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they found when they had difficulty filling jobs, 17<0x25> was associated with a lack of language skills.
So more and more, language skills are becoming necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
While many work opportunities are needed for language, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have more realistic chances in the future to have life skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75<0x25> were unable to speak a foreign language fluently to promote conversations in French which is the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, 15<0x25>.
This is why investing in language learning is now important for children.
Having multiple languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In each school, there will be a different language.
Several schools will focus on more modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in the near future, such as Danish or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there will always be several languages to choose from in independent schools, as well as training professionals in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will equip children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of their future professions.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in the context of international trade, that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and quality to Scottish youth.
We have to do well.
John Edward is the Director of the Board of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron plays his first game with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The waiting time is nearing its end for fans eager to see LeBron James play the first match as a Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season match on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet clear how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers writer Mike Trudell explained in a tweet that James could play a few minutes.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in the Lakers' schedule of "six pre-season games.
"I don't need any pre-season games at this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's Political Summit in West Virginia, YouTube
Donald Trump will start a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
You will be the first of the five conferences scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas that have many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote to verify whether it is still suspended about who has appointed him to fill the position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to form support in the elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Parliament when the votes are held in November.
How long will the Trump Summit in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
Trump's summit in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 1 p.m. Eastern Hours tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the West Virginia Trump conference online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about a case this week about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has raised concerns over allegations of sexual harassment that led to the temporary suspension of a Senate confirmation vote for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the goal of this series of meetings is to call for Republican candidates in November's election to gain more popularity.
President Trump's campaign committee said the five meetings next week were aimed at strengthening volunteers and supporters as the Republican Party tried to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Senate control is vital to its agenda so the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the more campaigning season," a Trump campaign committee spokesman who refused to be identified told Reuters.
Arranged to be held at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, this night's meeting could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania with the Pittsburgh media broadcast," according to West Virginia's Metro News.
It will be the second time in last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40<0x25> of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates a willingness to fight and maintain hopes ahead of a one-man game on Sunday
After three rounds on one side, a two-player game on Saturday afternoon can be the excitement that the Ryder Cup needs
The motion of the swing is a fully-designed game concept but in which players believe the truth and even more in competitions like this
So, where are they going now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four, so we take it as a little speed I think," said Jordan Spieth after concluding the day.
Europe has the best chance, of course, they are in front of four points, with the remaining twelve targets.
The Americans, as Spieth notes, feel that they have extra power and have a lot to encourage them, also considering the game Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boasts three out of four.
Spieth has been dangerous from the start of the game to the game pit and leads into a role model.
The bulk of the celebration noise increased as his turn continued, inserting the ball after hitting the ball towards the pit and balancing while he and Thomas were down by two points after two turns.
His ball to the pit won them a 15-hole match and got a lot of shouts to celebrate, which shows him he believes the American team is still not disappointed.
"You really have to work hard and focus on your own match," Spieth said.
That's what the players are doing now.
18 holes are waiting for them to show this.
The only players with more scores than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unexplained Ryder Cup legend.
This amazing pair from Europe has four out of four scores and has not made any mistakes at the moment.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't hit the ball the most on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided hitting the ball more frequently on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and in the last nine holes on Friday mornings.
The quality, and how their strengths seem to be increasing between them and the crowd show that the players will be the most competitive on Sunday and probably no other famous players will be able to win for Europe when it ends at the Le Golf National Stadium if not Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be nice if everyone did it at the same time in different holes.
It’s too early to talk about Europe’s victory, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson successfully faced Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in a two-game match against two, when he created a pair with Alex Noren.
The extra ball and two more balls in the first nine holes put the Spanish and Swedish in a situation that was difficult to get out.
On Sunday, however, no one can get you out of the situation you're going to get into.
The game against the two is very exciting to watch closely due to the interaction between the pair, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has done much better as a team so far and taken great leadership towards the final day but this period of the pair against the pair has also shown that the United States team is committed to fighting which some, especially the U.S., doubted.
Europe lead 10-6 in the Ryder Cup on the last day
Europe will have a good chance in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match with four balls for 10-6 against the United States.
Both Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two victories over Tiger Woods who appeared to be overwhelmed by their total score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to survive the cup they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States to appear to be weighed in a four-ball game in the morning, winning a 3-1 series.
The United States gave more resistance in match-ups against the pair and won two matches, but were unable to eliminate deficiencies.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 games on Sunday to stay with the shell.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive marks as he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a thrilling weekend they became the second pair to win only four points from their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match they collaborated well and defeated Wood and American Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both matches on Saturday, showed up for a good game but has now lost 19 out of 29 matches in four balls and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who rested for a four-ball match in the morning, returned to teaming with Henrik Stenson in a pair match and lost 2 and 1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not find everything even though the day was a beautiful, windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time Super Cup winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American model for two points on Saturday.
They scored 2 and 1 wins against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup have the team managed from behind with four points to a one-man game, though the Furyk team only needs from the uniform to stay with the Cup.
After being in second place for two days, however, the win-win struggle on Sunday seems to be far from them.
North Korea says it will "impossible" disarmament without believing that others will do what they ought to do.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were further undermining confidence in the United States and there was no way that the country could remove its nuclear weapons without others doing what they should under the same circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good intentions" last year, such as suspending nuclear tests and missiles, breaking down a nuclear test facility and promising not to overload nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without any U.S. trust, there would be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and there would be no way we would remove our weapons first without others doing what they ought to do."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's complaints about Washington's opposition to the "action" nuclear disarmament strategy in which North Korea would be rewarded taking small steps, his statements appeared significant as it did not reject the nuclear disarmament measures in terms of how Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current U.S. President and North Korean leader Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to "get rid of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been looking for an official solution to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US says Pyongyang must first remove its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also declined to call for an end to international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists" on the first withdrawal of nuclear weapons" and increases the level of pressure by using sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even oppose "the final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The idea that obstacles can not weaken is an impossible dream from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that the problems continue to grow.
"Ri did not mention plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader addressed to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If a partner in this issue of eliminating nuclear sleep would be South Korea and not the United States, the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula would not be in this bad situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that a move aimed at the US mainland and North Korea rockets would be inevitable after "Mr. President Trump" referred to Kim as a "rock man" who aims to commit murder.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking action to disarm, but said that much work still needs to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should suspend Pyongyang for its actions.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue in depth and inconsistently until we have a complete, final and verified withdrawal of nuclear weapons."
Together, the Security Council has extended sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funds for Pyongyang nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri after the UN General Assembly later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that progress had been made, but only within hours North Korea accused him of giving "conditions like a criminal."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy a missile station and a nuclear power station if the United States took "related actions."
He said Kim had told him that the "related steps" he wanted were the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and that he was going to strengthen relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
A new lesson at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to fight the culture of pretending to be gentlemen and to study "all night" for coffee.
‘The specialist found students at the university number one in the world have no knowledge of the basic issue of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the subject, which he believes is the first type in the United States.
. He was interested in creating a lesson after giving a speech about how insufficient sleep affects training.
At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I just being told this now, in my last year?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics about how a good sleep style helps in professional and sporting activities as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care, said that the university decided to start the study after finding out that students had fallen asleep a lot in a week.
An hour-long study involves a series of collaborative activities.
In one place there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are told about the effects of coffee and light and how sports activities are affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleep schedule.
In other places, participants are told how long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, scoliosis and cancer.
The college's map and co-operative accompaniment, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this lesson will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health consequences when you smoke," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'vigilance' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean sleep deprivation was an ongoing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep, with good quality, you should be a student's 'secret weapon' to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the mind in a state of dissatisfaction and makes you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a subject, after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the school opened his eyes and gave him the desire to create a whole school.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to do a corresponding course before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider keeping a sleeping alarm as well as a wake-up bell and be aware of the effects of 'blue light' produced by electrical screens and LED lighting, which can damage the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal kicks Gerrard's youth
The Rangers lost again in another away game when Dolly Menga's skate stole Steven Gerrard's team which appeared to be overwhelmed by a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team had been aiming for their first overseas victory since a 4–1 victory over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard to lose for a second time in 18 games as a manager and left his team with eight points behind the Ladbrokes League leaders, Hearts.
Manga scored seven minutes before the break and the Rangers never seemed to fit.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third place and is behind Hibernian only with a variety of goals.
And there may be more problems for Rangers after flag holder Calum Spence needs treatment after a head injury to something thrown from Rangers' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that scored Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who scored against Hearts last week and will be pleased with how his well-prepared team always faced their opponents.
The Rangers owned the ball more but Livingston made the best use of their positions when they got the ball.
They were to close only the second minute when Menga's first ball gave Scott Pittman a chance against Allan McGregor's but the midfielder threw the ball out.
The club's ball from Keaghan Jacobs caught captain Craig Halkett but his defender Alan Lithgow only managed to knock it out of the goal.
The Rangers took control but their game seemed to have only faith but not self-confidence as they approached the closing scene.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should get a penalty for 15 minutes after being hit by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game would continue even after the Colombian claim.
The Rangers managed to score two knockouts in the goal during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was less disturbed by headball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak slap from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute did not come from a regular game, no one can deny that they are eligible for the win.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with the kickoff from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher gave him the ball to Scott Robinson, who was strong and kicked the ball towards the touchdown Menga.
Gerrard made a decision during the break and switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the move was about to get results when the midfielder pushed the ball to Morelos but Kelly ran away from his position and blocked the ball.
But Livingston continued to distract the visitors and make them play the way they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett playing the ball long after each other.
Holt's team could have added a goal in the last minutes but McGregor was stable and stopped Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball out with a header.
Rangers midfielder Glenn Middleton had other penalties in the last minutes when they faced Jacobs but again referee Thomson ignored the request.
Annual Schedule: Discoverer of Geiger Counter
And now a page from our annual synopsis of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and on the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that ultimately led to the creation of a device known as Geiger Counter.
Based on science from then on, the Geiger Counter became popular in popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it in this world?"
Rogers: "It's Counter Geiger's device, it's used to detect radiation minerals, such as yarn.
When you put these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms generated by the transmitter within the minerals."
Evans: "Say, it's starting to sound right now!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The technique involves cooling immune cells from the patient, converting them into laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is popular in many cancers and then repositioned.
Experimental vaccines show positive results in patients with different cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify bad cells, was able to treat her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves refrigerating immune cells from the patient, converting them into laboratories so that they can "see" a common protein for multiple cancers called HER2, and then re-installing those cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very reliable vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lungs and gastrointestinal and purine, Prof Berzofsky explained.
Similar methods of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching them" how to target cancer cells have worked in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West has started a long and painful review of supporting Trump, wearing a MAGA cap, after appearing in the SNL season.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was featured in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a high-profile show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he could run for office in 2020.
After the performance of his third song that night, Ghost Town where he was wearing a hat written for Make America Great, he began to rebuke Democrats and promised support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white man, he often says, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I were worried about racism I would leave the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a short drama involving Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the event was not announced, West's lyrics content was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock attempted to mock West for the publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had a hard time before entering the stage in connection with his hat.
"They treated me badly behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go there with the hat.'
They wronged me!
And then they said that I was in the situation I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see the place to sink?” saying that he will wear my super hero’s hat, because this means you can’t tell me what I’m supposed to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try the love."
His comments were saddened to have at least doubled from an audience and SNL staff who appeared to be embarrassed, the Variety Center reported, with one person present reporting the post: "The entire studio went completely silent."
West had been brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier's water.
West was supported by the conservative leader of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE."
But interviewee Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just showing his point of view and that that's a pretty good thing."
"But I choose to reward someone else (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who I believe agrees with and disseminates beliefs that are dangerous to my community.
He's got freedom.
We too," he added.
Prior to the show, the referee announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the late musician Prince, changed his name to a sign and then an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington blames toxic masculinity
Kit Harington famous for hitting a sword as Jon Snow in the fantasy game series Game of Thrones of the HBO.
But the 31-year-old actress has criticized those who have a lot of opium, saying the roles on the screen mean young boys often feel like they should be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong in place" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted she feels 'much' in handling the issue.
"I feel personally, very strongly, at the moment - where have we gone wrong in terms of masculinity?" he said.
"What are we going to do when we're growing up, when we're talking about the problem we're facing?"
'Kit believes that television can be a part of an increase in toxic masculinity due to her male characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
Is that what is taught on television, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel they should be such a man?
I think that's one of the biggest questions we're facing right now - how can we change that?
Because things really go wrong with our young people.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in the preliminary and follow-up sessions of Game of Thrones when the series ends next season, saying he is satisfied with the battlefield and horses.
Starting in November Kit will be involved in a film from Sam Shepard True West which is the story of the filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the move to meet his wife Rose was the best result of her role in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during this period, so I found my future family, and my life from there," he said.
Rose starred as Ygritt , the love interest of the character Jon Snow who played as Kit, in a fantasy series that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie Scottish family.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14<0x25> increase in new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the new events were caused by sex, and marked changes from the past.
HIV spread rapidly in other parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to zero, Chinese health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be very high.
Because of the country's conservative ethics, studies have estimated that 70-90<0x25> of men in same-sex relationships eventually marry women.
Many diseases are caused by sexual harassment in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged access to all HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters denies that her employee has exposed GOP senators' data, denounced 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that his employee published personal information of three Republican senators on Wikipedia pages of the members.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said the allegations were being spread by analysts and websites of "strong right-wing supporters".
"False, false, and more irrelevant lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided is alleged to include home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Details appeared online on Thursday, published by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that an IP address that recognizes the source of the publications was linked to the Waters office and provides Waters employee information, Hill reported.
"These unfounded claims are completely false and misleading," Waters continued.
"My employee - whose identity, personal information, and security have been affected by these false and misleading allegations - was never involved in disclosing this information.
These false accusations are completely false and misleading."
Waters' statement was quickly sued online, including former White House News Minister Ari Fleischer.
"This rejection is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that he does not have proper emotional control to be a Member of Parliament.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
They should not be worried.
He should not be swayed by the aggressors.
He should be calm and calm.
"Fleischer was seen as comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing angry during a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate struggling to remove Waters in the representative election, also posted his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a great thing if it's true," he said on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
"We will make sure that those who have done this are exposed, "continued," and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to everyone and all my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again - a joke in the scam of Rowan Atkinson
It is not uncommon to watch the impact of Brexit on any new UK-based film, but it is not used in the backdrop of another Johnny English comedy-war comedy film - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the humor of personal jokes on the topic of how we are about to be a new opportunity overseas?
At any rate, Johnny English's eye-catching, moving face is licensed to repeat errors in a re-created way a second time - the name reflects his more gesture that he is designed with a broad sense of humor for non-English-speaking people.
He is actually a chizzy detective who despite the strange allegations of attractive attraction reflects the qualities of Clouseau, the attributes of Mr Bean and the person who contributed to one of the theatrical music of the Charitables of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in London 2012.
Initially he was involved as a traveler and a fantastic international character Atkinson was at one time involved in Barclaycard TV's now-forgotten broadcasts, leaving many as uninterested.
There's one or two things in this recent movie.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a traditional armour suit and radar paddles temporarily changing over his hat.
Atkinson's talent in physical comics appeared here, but comics seem to be low and unwanted, hussan because movies such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The humor seems to be aimed at children and not adults and to me the unique journeys of Johnny English are not innovative and have no focus on how the silent comics of Atkinson's character Bean.
The annual theory is that the UK is now in a serious crisis.
The cyber attacker has managed to get into the UK's secret web site and uncover the identity of all the UK detectives outside the workplace and surprisingly a spy at work - unfortunately it was a very simple task for Kevin Eldon.
In her final moments as a proud and face-to-face chief who is already deeply affected by political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing very well for her character which corresponds to Teresa May but the story does not help her to show these qualities.
His security advisers let him know that because the identity of each spy has been revealed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a schoolteacher at a prestigious school, but teaches informal lessons on how to be a secret detective: some good humor there, while English teaches a spy similar to the film School of Rock.
English is reintroduced to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and merged with his ex-boyfriend Bough, who is replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, he is associated with a naval commander, a thrilling opportunity where Vicki Pepperdine has not been involved in what should be.
So the characters that match Batman and Robin but by vandalism in the Secret Kingdom Service are back at work and in line with Olga Kurylenko who plays as Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister appears to be more involved with the exploration of a stepfather who claims to be able to solve all the technological problems in Britain: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their most enjoyable journey : they pretend to be hotel attendants, they set fire to a French luxury restaurant; they start rioting and unauthorizedly enter the Volta luxury boat; and English causes a speeder as he attempts to use the Improved Reality equipment to learn the interiors of the Volta boat.
All breaks have certainly been removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the gravity and chaos involved, there are so many children's episodes in the film.
Good things are good.
And just as with other Johnny English films I had to think again: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The British government has denied that it has a plan for the British to work for four days but was paid for five days.
The Leba party led by Jeremy Corbyn will focus on a strict plan that the British would work four days a week - but they were paid five days.
The party allegedly demanded that corporate leaders pay money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day.
It will require workers to grow up with three days of rest - but they will still go home with the same income.
Sources said the idea would be "profitable" for the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been supported by the Workers' Union Centre as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A key source of the Leba Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen immediately, but four working days are devoted to the party's vision of economic equilibrium for workers as well as the overall strategy of the party for the sector."
"The Leba Party will not be the first to propose such a proposal, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 2017 general election campaign.
At present, it is not supported by all in the Liberal Party, however.
A spokesman for the Leba Party said: "Four working days per week are not a party policy and is not considered by the party."
Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Leba summit to describe his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to remove authority from "invisible directors" and "enriches" in service companies.
The alternative Chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in water companies will not be able to return all their funds because the Leba Government can make "reductions" on the basis of perceived errors.
He also confirmed that plans to place employees on company boards and create Comprehensive Ownership Funds to provide 10 percent of private companies' money to employees, who will have an annual allocation of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy says the "60 Minutes" session if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote in connection with his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raised a question whether the FBI's findings could change the minds of Republican senators to support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I went to the court, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
"I called him after this happened, when the allegations came up, and I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was strong, honest, and honest."
Graham’s vote, however, does not seem to change.
"I have decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a very serious charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly declined, "Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford."
"Everybody involved could not prove it.
It's now 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the world's economy and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens Festival, a musical event that includes a fascinating list of stars singing as well as a similar fascinating message; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will lead tens of thousands to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which said in 2012, was the development of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people directly facing it.
In order to get a free event ticket (unless you would like to pay a VIP ticket), festival fans had to complete a series of activities, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, calling or any other effort to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the world's population been successful when it lasted 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concert tickets a real way to persuade people to push action, or just another case of so-called "online activism" – people feel like they are bringing a real difference by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizens Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million "acts" from its supporters to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have forced world leaders to declare <0x24>37 billion commitments and policies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group featured 390 commitments and promotions based on its actions, at least <0x24>10 billion already distributed or donated.
The group estimates the funds received so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and donors in the UK aimed at "helping children achieve their full potential," promising to donate 35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the world's population.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments, and citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just history," Ambassador of Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were completed in requesting the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children with a healthy diet.
In response to the question in the question section on his website, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The World Citizens Festival replied: It will be a long and arduous way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as there were human rights activists and groups against racism in front of us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars who will perform at the event in New York City, which the locals will be Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use the Navy to "restrict" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including the Middle East, US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke said, as described by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe their reason for being in the Middle East is to find energy markets as they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to deal with it.
"The United Nations has this capacity, along with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at the event organised by the Consumer Energy Association, a nonprofit group that claims to represent the "voice of energy users" in the United States.
He went on to compare the ways that Washington uses to exchange with Russia and Iran, saying that the countries are identical.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, in terms of consumption and exchange of oil," he said, referring to Russia as "smallly knowledgeable" and a economy based on coal.
The announcement comes at a time when the Trump administration has been in a mission to increase its natural gas sales to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very affordable option for European consumers.
As a result, leaders of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "negative" project of the "Nord Stream 2," which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "slave" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the 11 billion Nord Stream pipeline, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin says that much of Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that energy should not be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' position has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to shun the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will take a closer look" to running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "look more closely" if she ran for president after a representative election.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and reorganize our corrupt government that includes a woman in power," he said.
"After November 6, I will look into whether I will run for president."
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in a wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been very vocal about his opposition to Trump and his High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before we can vote."
"A survey released Thursday, however, showed for a large number of voters in the Warren area not feeling that he should run for 2020.
59<0x25> of the "potential" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a bid.
The study showed more support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38<0x25> supporting and 48<0x25> rejection.
Other prominent Democrats considered to be eligible to run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the stress caused by Track Palin at the Donald Trump summit
Track Palin, 26, stayed in Iraq for one year after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, I can understand other families who are experiencing the effects of the traumatic event and some of the effects our soldiers are returning with," he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "a controversial thing to be avoided" and said that his son and other soldiers, "returning separately, returning with a hard ideology, coming back wondering if there is any respect that landlords and astronauts and every other military ally, for his dedication to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and affected a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons when drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states, D.C. supports new immigration policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the opposition to the law to a new U.S. policy that rejects refuge for victims fleeing crime or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts submitted a small court-martial report on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers against policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. v. case against Sessions which was presented by the American Civil Liberties Union held in August against the country's policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "and his son's gang associates" persecuted him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was incarcerated in Texas.
Lawyers in support of the country described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries facing the problems of crime groups and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeal Board that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to be granted asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a Friday statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, state and international law."
"The law of the land requires that all claims of asylum be determined in accordance with the facts and specific circumstances of the claim, and the refusal violates the principle," said a court friend.
Further lawyers said in a statement that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering adversely affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide vital services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges no longer to provide refuge for victims of domestic violence by criminal groups in June.
"A refuge is available to those who flee their country because of violence or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement about the policy.
The move to provide refuge was not meant to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - that people face every day around the world.
Many rescue efforts in Palu while the number of disasters has doubled in the race for survivors,
For the most part, the situation was getting worse.
"It looks very bad," said a 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, comforting her flu-stricken child at a rescue center in the city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not available."
"Residents were seen returning to their damaged homes, picking up flooded equipment, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured while hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, failed to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were buried outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to ongoing earthquakes.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she and her daughter were staying.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stabbed in the debris of the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to my son.
I hope you are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "abusing" through "propaganda advertising"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper highlighting the shared benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's daily payments to the Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 U.S. delegation's election, a claim that China has denied.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections reflects what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's fast-moving campaign to push for China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing each other in a trade war that has led to an increase in the tariffs on each other's products.
China's retail tariffs early in the trade were created to affect exporters from states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, China's chief exporter of agricultural goods, said Beijing had a negative impact on U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
In China, Branstad wrote in a commentary at the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reducing the abuse by posting propaganda advertisements on the free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a method sponsored by the United States of opinion and free information by placing paid advertisements on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In comparison, on the local newspaper sections in Beijing, you'll find very few voices giving rise to opposition and you'll be unable to see the realities and different views that the Chinese people may have regarding China's troubled economic goals, considering that the media is closely controlled by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Separate Women Voting to the Period of Representative Votes With Kavanaugh Crisis, Analyst Warn
While many supporters defending a candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several allegations of sexual abuse, critics have warned that they will get adverse results, especially from women, during the representative elections.
The feelings surrounding this have been very high and many Republicans have openly expressed their desire to continue the vote.
These things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he is worried that the final pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI's investigation will be enough to cure the voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and even the rest of November," said a senior national advisor and spokesman for the MoveOn development group on Friday, according to the Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched on the Senate highway as Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The influence and motivation of democrats exceeded expectations", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told a news website.
"People say it's already high; that's true.
But it can be much higher, especially among women who vote in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony described sexual harassment against the Supreme Court's electorate, analysts said the negative consequences could follow if the Republicans would continue to prove it.
"This has been a mud game for the GOP," said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, it's also about how Republicans have dealt with this and how they treated him," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group helping to elect Democrats, said in a news agency.
However, the Americans seem to have some division about who is credible after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with many reliant on Kavanaugh.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41<0x25> of participants are obvious or perhaps believed in Ford's testimony, while 35<0x25> said it was obvious or perhaps they believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38<0x25> said they thought Kavanaugh clearly or perhaps lied during his testimony, while only 30<0x25> said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating claims made by Ford along with another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Committee last week under an oath that Kavanaugh had abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the Supreme Court Selection revealed its secrets while attending a ceremony at school in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Developer Plans to Start a New Web To Competition with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of World Wide Web, launches a new business that will launch competition against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technician's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that is formed through the Berners-Lee's Liberal Solid platform.
Solid allows users to select the location where their data will be stored and people are allowed to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee claimed that the purpose of Inrupt is to "rule the world."
"We have to do that now," he said about business.
"It's a historic moment."
The software uses Solid technology to allow people to create "online data storage" or POD.
It can include a list of contacts, a list of things to do, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
And the only thing about online personal data storage is that only the user can access what kind of information.
The company refers to this as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the resources, processes and skills necessary to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee's Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the developers hired to create this project with a dedicated community of code developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own one-stop apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they should initiate a complete change in which all their business models will be merged in one night."
"We don't ask for their permission."
At a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and environmental energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee switched to the network when he founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the debate of having a free website.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain a Partner and Director of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Foundation.
"I'm very optimistic about this time period," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Winner of the Victoria Cross at WWW1
The only Church of England to win the Victoria Cross award during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his town 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehoucourt.
However, he was killed by a target attacker four days later and never realized that he had won the UK's highest military award.
The memorial stone has been unveiled by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it is "a wonderful example" that the stone is especially revealed 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his squadron along the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and a sharp fire extinguisher from the field and rifle."
He later ran on the firing line and with "the greatest courage" led the line forward before using the field gun alone and targeting three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German targeting invader on 4 October 1918 - over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "actions I know I can't reach but it's very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also crowned the flower crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said "he felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is shown with the support from many people."
The MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Think of this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 but just refused to watch the main event.
The bill from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was aired live all night in the UK via Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the audience in England were left open while the show was transformed into Peppa Pig.
Others became disillusioned after staying awake until the early hours especially for fighting.
One fan on Twitter described the changing and setting of children's cartoons as "some kind of very bad joke."
"It's a government policy where when it came at 6:00 a.m. content wasn't appropriate so it had to change programs to be for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about broadcasting.
""Peppa the pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would go to work on their schedule to include British audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the destination, I think we can probably focus on this," Coker said.
"But now it's 6 a.m. on Sunday there and we can't keep this up until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're keeping it.
I believe, when it changed, there was a lot of messages being sent and it didn't grow well.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a government issue.
I can assure you that such a thing will not happen in the future.
We will put it in five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to make an effort for the fans but failed.
It's an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "weak" because of his gender
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt weak because of his gender throughout his childhood – but that gave him the motivation to succeed in life.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he entered high school and "I realized that not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the Radio 4 episode of Desert Island Discs produced by Lauren Laverne, she says that she spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others "hope."
He says the move to become a parent has made him less focused on winning the Olympics.
The long-standing producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for some time due to illness.
Shared as an isolated person in Laverne's first episode, Daley says that she felt "some less" than anyone her peers because "it was not permissible to love girls and boys."
He said: "Until today, those feelings of self-esteem and some limitations, and feeling different from others, are things that have given me the strength and the ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he could not discourage anyone when they finally discovered his gender.
The two-time bronze medal winner of the Olympics has become a prominent member in LGBT support campaigns and was used as a cop to participate in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to take the issue of homosexuality as a crime.
He said he appeared because he felt lucky to be able to live without impact and wanted to give others "hope."
The world champion three times said he fell in love with another man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unexpectedly found him."
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, last year but said the age gap has never been a major issue.
"When you go through a lot of things at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced such things.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his attitude" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are things that are bigger than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked for was if they still got their London 2012 Olympic tickets - because he wanted to be the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near that line'," he said.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing and had to stop breathing completely and I thought she had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - dive in front of a crowd of our people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also encouraged her choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired her during the preparations for the Olympics and made her excited.

Mickelson, who has not played well, is placed on a bench in Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to improve his game so that he does not reach the stage unhappy.
Mickelson, playing in a two-time event a year and setting a 12-game record, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball and a pair game.
Instead of being in the depths of the episode, as he was often with the United States, this big cup winner divided his day five times between being a fan and practicing the game in hopes of fixing his problem.
Never a leader even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player is not a suitable choice for a game in Le Golf National, where bad football is often punished.
And if the field is not a sufficient reason, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces British champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind as they start a 12-man match, have a strong resistance, Mickelson's match can prove to be quite important.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, embraced me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very brave in his strength.
He's a very popular person and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past days and this week.
I didn't see him playing two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's what happened and that's the way we thought we should take into account.
He wants to be out there playing, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches in the Ryder Cup played on Sunday.
It could be his final in playing Ryder Cup which has never matched the quality of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He's very friendly, friendly, and he's a good person to be with," he said.
"I think the players were also happy to fight with him this week, which was very interesting to see.
It's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of many symbols can soon be lost
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a great leadership coming into the last days of the Ryder Cup can turn into a worrying journey.
The debtor played his first match in 1997 at Valderrama, where the team led by Seven Ballesteros led with five points against the Americans but ended the game in a warm-up, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we had a great leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very close," said Bjorn, photographed, after watching the 2018 Classic win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story shows me and everyone in the team that the game is still over.
You'll be stronger tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you do the right thing.
This game is not finished until you get the mark.
We have a goal and we are trying to win this Cup and that's what we're aiming for.
I've said this all the time, I'm focusing on 12 players who are in our team, but we know very well the quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
"Impressed by the way his players played in a difficult field, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't be more optimistic about this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal activity that you will decide and that is a different matter.
It's nice to be out there with a partner when things are interesting, but when you're out there alone, then you've been thoroughly tested for all your abilities as a golfer.
That's the message you need to tell the players, it's to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner to go and do better yourself, too.
"Unlike Bjorn, rival team captain Jim Furyk will hope his players will do better personally than when they played as partners, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was involved in the popular games on the last day, after being part of the team that won at Brookline before finishing in defeat as Europe experienced "The Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every word," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, brought his players to the final.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get a good start as it was at Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When the speed goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfielders.
We have successfully organized our players and put people in the way we felt we wanted, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and tackle Rory McIlroy in a top-level match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter others in the European team in the top half of the list.
"I went with this team in this order because I think it focuses on the whole journey," said Bjorn for his choice of players in a personal game.
The German Navy has been rebuilt
The newest German Navy ships were scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace the old ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to bad systems and increased cost, the media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship between the new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit magazine citing a military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but future submission issues affected the fate of this large project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg submarines that the Navy ordered in 2007 are coming to replace the Bremen submarine.
It is known that they will include a power canon, an air-conditioning range and decorative missiles and ships as well as secret technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acostic signals.
Other important features include maintenance after a long time - it is possible to send the new ships for two years away from home.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the high-level warships - which are said to allow Germany to target abroad - will already be outdated and when they come into operation, explained Die Zeit.
The F125 gained prominence last year, when the German Navy refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to shipbuilders after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons for the restoration, but German media cited several reasons for "critical software and hardware flaws" that made the ships unimportant if they were sent to war.
Deficiencies in the program were important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship would be operated by 120 sailors - only half of the crew on the old Bremen fleet.
Also, it turned out that the ship had extra weight which amablo reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to improve it in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the whole project - including staff training - is also a big issue.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euro (<0x24>3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing a new ship are particularly significant due to the warning that the German naval power has fallen.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that Navalism is actually " going to miss ships capable of being sent to war."
The officer said the matter had been ignored for a long time, because the old ships had been removed but no alternative ships had been released.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet would be used by the Navy.
The Native American Trust is the lifeblood of the
A new study in the region in the Scottish Mountains aims to explain how bats use the environment in hunting their food.
You expect these results to provide new insights into the unique behavior of these flying animals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow the pipistrells and soprano bats as well as the long ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key areas around the area to monitor bat operations throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct telephone surveys using hand-held diagnostics.
Audio analysis for the expertise of all records will confirm the frequency of bats' voices and the species doing so.
Environmental maps and reports will be provided to create a comprehensive graphical environment for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation consultant at NTS, expects the results to show which ecosystems are most important for bats and how they are used by each bat species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as grazing and the best ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and England has decreased dramatically in the last century.
They pose a threat to construction work and development that affects nests and housing losses.
Windmills and lighting can also cause hazards, as well as pesticides and some chemical products of building materials, as well as pet cat attacks.
Poverty isn't really bad.
However, due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more important than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a complex local echo technique to target insects and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens of 76,000 hectares of land across the country, consider bats very seriously.
It has provided training to ten trained specialists, who regularly conduct research, nesting inspections and sometimes salvage bats.
The organization has even established the first and unique bat reserve in Scotland on Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Property manager David Thompson said the property is the best place for the bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the beautiful surroundings.
But there is a lot about bats that are not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need in order to thrive.
"He emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before making repairs inside the property because it is possible for unintelligible damage can kill up to 400 female bats and young bats, possibly destroying the entire population of bats in the area.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Pop Conservation Society, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats because most of our species do not know how many species are left."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers plan to prosecute a German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo said the rape allegations against him were "false news," saying people "want to advertise" in his name.
His lawyers have planned to fire the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with raping a US woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly later paid him <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live to 142 million followers just hours after the allegations, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, "the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says on camera."
"They want to use my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm happy and I'm okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they said were "unacceptable allegations of suspicion in the private sector," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral degradation according to the seriousness of violations, which may be one of the most serious human rights violations in recent years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a request at the Hotel and Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him on the back, according to documents submitted to Clark County County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo knelt down after the incident and told him that for "99<0x25>" he was a "good" man who was dropped by "one percent."
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also says that he went to report to the police and was photographed of his injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an outside court compensation because he felt "fear of revenge" and was concerned about "public embarrassment."
The 34-year-old woman says she is now ready to take revenge because she is still struggling with the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the allegations, and this season he moved to Italian champion Juve when he was bought for <0xC2><0xA3>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret losing car manufacturers'
Britain will "forever regret" the loss of its position as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "annoying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a contract it could stop production time at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays if there is no contract after Brexit will lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Auris Toyota and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90<0x25> being exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the European Union in March we will see an action to stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the European Union without agreement on how the border trade will operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues are related to what developers say are the risks of distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is implemented on the basis of "time-appropriate", with supplies arriving every 37 minutes from retailers in the UK and the European Union for imported vehicles.
If the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement on March 29, there may be problems at the border that the sector says could lead to delays and equipment shortages.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait for more one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and production will therefore be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union was "just planned to avoid the investigation at the border."
“We need to have a plan. We want to have a better deal that will allow us not only to succeed at the moment but also to take advantage of the existing opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but other developers is that we absolutely need to be able to keep up with the supply that has been successful in the past."
Toyota could not say the time of stopping production, but for a long time, it warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and ultimately job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Union in the factory, said his partners are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these job opportunities leave they never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" as a dispute over high-level court-elect Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser David Mueller, who investigates electoral interference with Russia, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia and the possibility of a right-wing ban with the president.
Whether or not Trump would seek a job as a deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, it has sparked Washington's rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of pulling the president through a 25-man amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, where he said he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations summit in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred" not to dismiss Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid collisions and lawsuits at the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, resulting in a full Senate vote delay.
Trump's secretary of state, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The date for that has not yet been set, it could be this week, I can see that it could lead to another week being pushed back into the high court.
But we will see what will happen to the media.
"Other journalists could have objected: Sanders has not hosted a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information is not due to the impartiality of television journalists of "interesting attention," although he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He added that the direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We have looked at the data."
"The press release will continue," Sanders said, "but if the media have the opportunity to ask him direct questions to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that many times and you've seen us do more in the last few weeks and that this will take place at a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
"Trump answers frequently asked questions when leaving the White House or when taking part in open sessions or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and press conferences alone are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving an informal speech and occasionally appearing in front of a crowded press.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at the Scottish Health Agency about Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written to EU workers working for the Scottish Health Agency expressing gratitude for the country and expecting them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter while remaining six months to Britain to withdraw from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to meeting the cost of application for residential status for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on withdrawal have continued, towards the decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also improving its preparations for an impossible solution.
I know this is a very happy time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our partners from all over the European Union and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, and help patients and the communities we serve.
"Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a game that failed 31–27 on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the edge and just sat down," Reed said.
The staff and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge before putting him on the frog for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no explanation of the type/intensity of pain yet" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five matches on Saturday before leaving the game, which increased the total of matches in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged with high stamp taxes when purchasing in the UK
Foreign buyers will be taxed on high stamps buying property in the UK while additional funds are used to help the homeless under the new Tory deal.
The move aims to balance Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Increased tax rates will be paid to those who do not pay their taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to <0x24>120 million annually - to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged with high stamp taxes buying property in the UK - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved to attract young voters with the promise of providing affordable housing and targeting those with higher incomes.
Increase in stamp taxes will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their taxes in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to combat homelessness.
Those additional payments - which include the current stamp taxes, including the highest rates set two years ago on second- and rental houses - can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will provide up to <0x24>120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13<0x25> of new buildings in London are purchased by non-British residents, resulting in an increase in price and making it difficult for first-time buyers to buy their first home.
Many rich parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "spirit cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson applied for a discount on stamp taxes to help more young people buy their first home.
He denounced large construction companies for placing high property prices on purchases and failing to build them and asked Mrs. May to resign from renting a house to fix "a disgrace in the UK's housing sector."
Mr. Corbyn has announced an impressive series in housing reform, including tax control to end the "innocent" eviction situation.
He also wants to give them more power to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I wanted to volunteer to restore the British dream - that life should be the best for every new generation.
This means that we have to change our decentralized environment.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it cannot be fair that it is easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes at the same price as hard-working residents in the UK.
For so many people the dream of homeownership has been very far away and there is a lot of probability of homelessness."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the boss of Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "cause" is to become Scottish manager for a period of time.'
The 42-year-old is thrilled with the challenge of reviving the North-East club, now in third place in the First League, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was able to get the country's B team game and it got there," Ross told BBC Sportsound show Scotland.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and I have always been attracted to it.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I succeed in club management."
"Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he wasn't afraid to follow the famous titles at such a big club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be measured by 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities in this club, it must certainly be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to return, but I'd just like to see if I've been successful here if I can get the club back up."
"Ross has only three years since he started his managerial career, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as coaching staff at Hearts club.
He then assisted Alloa from being lowered to third place and replaced St Mirren from being downgraded to winning the League cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Maybe it was the real way," he recalled, of taking over the management of Alloa.
"I really believed management was better for me, more than playing.
It's amazing because I did the right thing, I earned income from playing and enjoying the highest levels.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.
I'm still struggling with stress and stress, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to be a manager and I'm doing it now, I feel the best in myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for getting alcohol is 11.30 p.m. on Saturday, a study found
The heat of summer has increased drinking in UK bars struggling but has increased pressure on restaurants.
Bars experienced a 2.7<0x25> increase in July - but drinking in restaurants decreased to 4.8<0x25>, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's commercial advisor, which included the figures, said: "The continuation of the sun and Britain's more timely participation in the World Cup means July followed the same pattern as last June, when bars experienced a 2.8<0x25> increase, except that restaurants experienced even more impact.
A 1.8<0x25> discount on the restaurant business in June fell further in July.
The beer bars did better while restaurants had discounts.
Food bars were affected in the summer, although not as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out and get alcohol.
Controlled bars experienced a 6.6<0x25> increase in sales for the month and a three-percent decrease in food supplies."
Paul Newman, an entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are continuing in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
Climate change and the impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8<0x25> drop in sales per year will be very painful considering the ongoing cost-effective pressures.

One out of every five children has private social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some even 11 years old - have confidential social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, the study reveals.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed growth in "false insta" pages
The report raised fears that sexual content was published
Twenty percent of students said they own a "big" account to show their parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - are creating fake social media accounts that keep secrets from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in the "false Insta" account - references to a website to share Instagram photos.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they are creating a "big" account to show parents, while also owning other private accounts.
One mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a teenager urging others to "marry."
The study of Digital Awareness UK and the British Association of Teachers of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40<0x25> of 11- to 18-year-olds had two accounts and half agreed to keep accounts private.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many young people are being tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish athletic board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletes as an unofficial director at the board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the game to benefit from his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by participating in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am interested in becoming the voice of athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help lead the game in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta between his four total Olympic golds and is now an analyst at the BBC, failed to walk after experiencing a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said it would only be known in time if I could recover and to what extent.
It's been a difficult task to fully recover, to learn again how to walk and today to make a repeat of the cycle!
Thank you for the comforting message!"
An advertisement for breast pump comparing mothers and cows creates a different view online
The breast pump company has shared comments online using an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows that are digested.
To mark the launch of what is known as the "silentest breast pump in the world," consumer technology company Elvie released a comedy music video advertisement to show the freedom that a new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with cow's food with a song consisting of such words as "Yes, I struggle, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't recognize these twins are my breasts."
The song goes on: "Get out, go out, feed the children, get out, get out, beat up my women."
However, the ad, published on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 times viewing and hundreds of views, the video has received different views from viewers and many say it reflects the "fear" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
If we need to conceive and reproduce to produce milk, unless their babies are removed immediately after birth, "one wrote.
Elvie's breast pump goes very well into breastfeeding syndrome (Elvie/Mother)
Another said: "It bothers the mother and the baby mentally.
"Why don't you use them to advertise breast pumps to mothers who remain with their children?"
Another added: "Announcement that doesn't take into account the real situation."
Some defended the ad and one woman admitted that she felt the song was "humble."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I would have found one if I still had it.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a scam, but I understand it.
This is a high quality innovation product," one wrote.
Another said: "This is a fun ad that focuses on mothers who breastfeed milk (usually in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feels like a "cattle."
"This is not a complimentary announcement or criticism of the milk industry."
At the end of the video a group of women show that they have all been playing with a pump on their syndicates.
The idea of a campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use the pump say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is completely silent, has no cables or subcutaneous and is perfectly suited to the breastfeeding syndrome and gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, an ECD partner and teacher at Mother said: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and stimulating launch.
Considering the similarity between explaining women and dairy cows we wanted to put the breast pumping action and all its challenges into care, while demonstrating in a fun and interesting way the sense of freedom that a new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, a mother of two children walked on the stage to architect Marta Jacobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children relocated to Tent Camp in Texas Border
The number of immigrant children detained has increased even though the number of migrants passing the border has not changed, because the strict policies and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to keep children for donors.
Most of the donors have become unregistered immigrants and are afraid to risk their stay in the country by continuing to demand a child.
The risk increased in June, when the country's authorities announced that potential donors and other adult households would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albence, a senior official for Immigration and Customs Execution, testified in front of Parliament that the organization had arrested several people who had asked to help children who were alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70<0x25> of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"About 80<0x25> of the people who are donors or family members are illegal here in the country and most of them are foreign criminals.
. So we keep tracking those people," Mr. Albence said.
In the process of faster child rehabilitation, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to be brought to court within a month after their arrest, rather than 60 days before, according to residential staff.
Many will be presented via video conferencing, rather than someone present, to apply for their case to a legal status to a immigration judge.
Those who do not receive help will soon be returned to their home countries.
The longer the child stays in detention, the more likely the child is to become anxious and anxious or depressed, which can lead to feelings of violence or attempts to escape, according to residential staff and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
Lawyers said these issues are escalating in major centers such as Tornillo, where signs that a child has a negative state are ignored, due to its size.
They added that relocating children to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or interacting with friends for the last time could add to the trauma that many are already experiencing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish troops to leave immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although it has now been eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally located in Syria, under the pretext of counter-terrorism and will be "dealt with accordingly."
"They should leave immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism was about to end" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred war until we can save all parts of Syria" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
"The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and mentoring Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said the situation was good for them to return and blamed the "western countries" for "spreading false fears" that caused refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate return action," he said.
"They're putting politics into a human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no building support for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a bazaar in Idlib's last rebel fort has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish treaty has blocked attacks by Syrian-backed forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem however insisted that the agreement had a "open period" and expressed hope that military action would help militias including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would be "finished."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to prepare the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to investigate the provisions of the current constitution," and warned against intervention.
Why Trump won a second term in office
With that in mind, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless the progressive audience and many changes are optimistic that the elimination of the abuse of power and scandal will end his presidency early.
It's the "big end of the world!"
At present, there are no signs of fatigue of the viewer.
Since 2014, the rating of major times has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, leading in cable television ratings for 3.5 million viewers in the main news night.
"These are things that attract people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama show "Designed Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after the attack destroyed Capitol's presidential office.
Nell Scovell, a former comic writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalls a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asked.
"He said, 'Because he's making me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, a story from Washington could decide later Roe v. v. Wade's case, if the immigrant families could reunite with the health of the world economy.
It is only for those who have a lot of opportunities that can afford it.
However, this issue surpasses a conscientious citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of viewing a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep" in the sources of his book "Fear," a <0x24>15,000 leather jacket of Paul Manafort's designer's "sweet dress with pride, "Washington Post said" and the result of Stormy Daniels's commentary.
I'll never see Super Mario again.
"Part of what he does and makes it look like a real show is that he gives you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and designer of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's period of changing characters and scenes every day (starting a confrontation in the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You don't want to miss a period or stop tracking.
When I approached Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a 80-degree sun outside his house on the north side of Kauai, but he had locked himself inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not as Brett Kavanaugh was about to go before the Senate Committee and the Supreme Court's fate if it was unclear.
“I remember when we were doing all these amazing sessions a few days ago and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was funny, but it turns out they were right."

External funds flooded into the nearest election of parliamentary representatives
Not surprisingly, 17 Pennsylvania districts have suffered financial flooding, thanks to the reliance on parliamentary districts that have gained two current leaders fighting for the same seat.
The newly acquired district of Pittsburg has Democrat Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in the final election of the spring season.
Lamb is running for another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, the current leader representing Pennsylvania's 12th old district, which is widespread with 17 new.
The maps were reconstituted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been drawn to suit Republicans.
The new 17-year-old has launched a financial competition in the financing groups of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) Parliamentary Committee and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a slight victory in a special election closely pursued in March in the 18th Pennsylvania Legislative District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political analysts say Democrats have a better chance of winning.
The U.S. planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then stopped
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with less pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a fine meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies fired the Trump Foundation management team.
Officials in the State Department have decided to remove the U.S. diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the latest decision of not recognising Taiwan," said the department's spokesman, Heather Nauert, in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which earned <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and restrictions on visa applications, would have had a significant impact on the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As local meetings continued, North and Central American leaders recommended a high level summit on security and economic well-being and followed a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the summit to continue and effectively put an end to any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the summit, scheduled for mid-October, with signs of the importance the administration has put on the convention, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new hard dispatch or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate made by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to negotiate internal negotiations without revealing identity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration and he also spoke without revealing identity.
A History Survey
The next shoe to fall might be a report by special attorney Robert Mueller about Mr. Trump's potential to block justice, where there is now considerable evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also directs his investigation if Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in attacking our election.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability cases in the legislature, just as he prepares to re-elect the voters and perhaps ultimately the judges of his allies.
That’s a lot of things that are only saying right now is possible and I’m not saying that Mr. Trump’s removal from power is inevitable – neither for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made by each side of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fighting continues.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a revolution against Hitler, only if the West would refuse to support and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to escape the years that followed.
The trend of history revolves around such changes and the stability of the course of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is facing a number of changes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller’s fate?
Rosenstein has been in critical condition since the newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed secretly recording the president and said he was not eligible for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says Times memory is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the FBI's new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete and fair - or if he will be proven to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?"
And above all, we'll be able to vote in the election of representatives of Parliament who will not be able to make Mr. Trump focus on justice?
If we fail to meet these criteria, democracy will face the risk of long-term decline.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was exiled to Auschwitz by the Nazi government which at one time used my consulate.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika sign.
With that as my heritage, how can I lose a positive outlook on our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has a lot of hopes before the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after a good match in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first match this season to a 2–2 draw against Villarreal but he believes the Rangers could use the results to set up a lot of things.
"It was a good sign for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game believing we could get something and go back with a score.
Maybe we could get more at the end but, in general, the uniform was probably the same result.
They were probably the best in the first half and we went in the second half better.
Entering Thursday, it's another great night in Europe.
We hope, we can get all three points but it will be a tough game because they got good results in their final game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year was very difficult, amid everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club but there's a good feeling about this place now.
They are the same as the players who enjoy it; your training is the same.
We hope, we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed."
Women who fall asleep because of fear of losing weight
While it was true that the research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their families about this.
Nearly half of the people in a nationwide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to care about them, but they don't take steps to negotiate," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide Insurance.
This is how the person begins.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to provide services if you don't make your wishes well known ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive the services, because such options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy of a hybrid value of money to address these expenses or self-determination for your wealth - the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Prevent your legal cases early.
Get a certificate of representation of medical care so that you can appoint a person you trust to manage your medical care and make sure that professionals comply with your requirements if you are unable to contact.
You will also receive a lawyer's contribution to your finances.
You should choose the person you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your expenses are paid in a timely manner.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Do you have the ability to answer questions about medicines and herbs?
Put these in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the money involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the treatments?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Make the plan a good one."
Man shot multiple times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times by an air rifle while walking home from night entertainment.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officials described the incident, which took place at 8:30 BST, as a "sudden act."
The victim did not see his attackers.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have asked witnesses to appear.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said and the number of disasters is expected to rise.
As communications are interrupted, aid officials have not been able to get any information from the Donggala administration, a region north of Palu that is close to a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the western end of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city has been celebrating 40 years since the tsunami.
Donggala is a coastal administration of more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The short-term government, the administrative area under the county, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Sulawesi Central Province, especially the Donggala coastal area.
The mining of nickel is also important in the region, but it is mainly found in the Moruwali, adjacent to the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Fire Ring and is frequently hit by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of the deaths from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, an island of Indonesia's most populous population, causing a tsunami that broke off the southern coast, killing around 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, apart from Sumatra causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters in length that destroyed several villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake struck the regime of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing damage and fear while people commemorate the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused at this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence and refusing arrests, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when her girlfriend tried to call the police to report the allegations of a crime, she took her phone.
Palin is confined to Mat-Su's Preliminary Case Centre and on a <0x24>500 insecure bond, reported KTUU.
He came to the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, in fact" when asked for his requests, the network reported.
Palin faces three serious charges of Level A, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined <0x24>250,000.
He has also been charged with a B-value offence, a fine of <0x24>2,000 a day.
It's not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with harassing his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attacks.
The case is now in front of the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with a domestic assault, blocking a report of domestic crime and possession of weapons while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife had said that she had hit him on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the war veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the Stress-Free Event PTSD-based phenomenon of her ministry in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electronic networks and communications are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the future.
The earthquake occurred just outside of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the time of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach concert in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
Prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been implemented in the state for state crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have used the Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bicycle route along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious physical injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All these offences carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
Weeks after the attack, a panel of state judges ruled on 22 charges to Saipov which included eight murder charges for fraud, usually used by state prosecutors in organized crime and trafficking charges.
Attacks needed to be "planned and well prepared," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's action as "abusive, brutal and misleading."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages, and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damianucse's report,"
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since New York's Southern District carried out the death penalty charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the New York state case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were sentenced to death after being found guilty of conspiring to conspirate for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by being placed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has denied 22 counts of crimes.
David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "depressed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence sentence without the possibility of being released would only add to the trauma of such incidents to all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's representative team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "encourage the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tory rally.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel warm" from anti-European citizens - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should be the president of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Party MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain "should be out" by now as Mr. Farage would be Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Ms May faces is the challenge of bringing together her most divided side of what was seen as Tory supporters of Remaining joined in a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to implement his Checkers deal as he faces criticism from Brexit supporters, supporters of Remaining and the European Union.
His allies insisted that he would continue with the move to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite objections - and forcing opponents of the European Union and the Leba party to choose between his plan and the 'chaos'.
Mr Bone told the Leave Meaning at Solihull that he wanted to 'throw off the Chequers' deal.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and assigned to negotiations with Brussels.
‘If he had control, we'd already be out now,’ he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers deal."
Speaking on his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight in a world war to remain under others.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone denied proposals that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not entirely true.'
Tory's pro-Brexit MP Andrea Jenkyns was also in a protest and told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Checkers' plan is not very popular with the general public, Opposition cannot vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us get elected.
Please leave the checkers program and start listening to people."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: "The Prime Ministers retain their positions when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made "feel warm" if they are about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is about the issue of loyalty between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let you do that.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: "I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
"We are encouraging the army of the people of this country that will give us victory in Brexit and that will never rest until we are free, rely on ourselves, and become a proud British."
Meanwhile, the Conservatives continued the protest through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Many activists showed signs of Tories vs. Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The Liberal MP Mr. Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered in the party program when the meeting opened.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems and technologies of the UK and the European Union to respect the laws of another, to an uncomfortable limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a lie.
"There's nothing like Brexit," he added.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she plans to "look deeper into the intentions of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats talked about his fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a recurring critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, former chairman of Trump Campaign 2016 in Massachusetts.
He has been in the middle of rumours that he could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th congress with voters using the town hall design since Trump was elected.
The interviewer asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that "it is time for women to go to Washington to reform our broken government, and that involves a woman in the top seat."
Man arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in connection with death for the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 5 a.m. ET at a press conference.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University in early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in the head and eventually died of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde intervened to protect his partner when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being in the area of the incident, possession of a weapon and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the Eastern Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6-yard 6-yard 6-yard player who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games in the previous season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the World Cup after team orders him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas graduated before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to follow the traffic on the team's tail, something that was supposed to contribute a lot.
Mercedes made one round and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a fierce competition which made the Ferrari driver leave the local area free from the impact of the closure after doing so twice in the third round.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was in seventh place for the end of the first round in his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held up and then passed to Kimi Raikkonen and became the fourth.
He eventually reached his relegation zone in the 14th round and failed to accelerate in the remaining eight rounds with Raikkonen taking fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a wonderful job throughout the weekend and showed maturity to let me pass.
The team has done a unique job to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It was a bad language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Committee, instead he said that what is going on in the Senate showed that the people were "selfish, evil and false."
"One thing that can happen and something good that has been going on in the Senate for the past few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and greedy and evil and who are lying," he said.
"When you look at the offerings and revelations and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Do you remember his answer... did you disclose the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I did not reveal it.
"Yeah, wait a minute.
Are we revealing...No, we didn't reveal," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter describing charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was unveiled in early September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford. I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he asked."
But his objections did not seem to have been well received by the president, who commented during a meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you this, that was a terrible language of the body.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's nominee, who has been charged with sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their benefit.
"They have decided to take control of everything.
You see greed, evil, they don't care who hurts them, who have affected them to gain power and control," Mediaite reported the President saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars compensated a losing match against the Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by winning a 5–3 rematch match in Dundee Saturday.
The Giants gained an early lead through two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie balanced the locals before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead again.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals for Lukas Lundvald Nielsen gave them a win.
It was the third losing match in the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time they met in the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 am after receiving the ball from Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford gave him the ball to Beauvillier to score the second goal four minutes later.
In a first-round excitement, Sullivan scored the locals at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt scored a pass that resulted in a Cownie 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants led before the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first period.
The Natives reorganized and Bouchard once again balanced them in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period and ensure a fifth goal in the final.
The Giants, who have now lost the last four games, will be the Millton Keynes natives in their next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller dies while ensuring hundreds of passengers on planes can avoid earthquakes
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after losing his life while ensuring that the plane carrying hundreds of people has left safely.
More than 800 people have died and others have been missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Later quakes continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
He then flew the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of people, ABC News of Australia reported.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a large hospital in another town.
This morning, we lost the car before we arrived at the airport.
"Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the leadership fears that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster reduction agency has said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is very limited.
"The number is still believed to be increasing as many bodies were still stuck under the falls with difficulty reaching many," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
The six-metre-long wave has destroyed Palu which will provide mass burials on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring support and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not readily available.
Small markets are broken up all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help the victims but we don't know what the situation is.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete every transit-related activity.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini says one person has disappeared after a plane crash into the lake.
A Pacific airline owned by a plane that crashed in Micronesia has said one person is unavailable, after saying that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely rescued after the plane sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that by Saturday afternoon, he could not find out if he was a single man.
The agency said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane crashed while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The agency said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the sequence of events is still unknown.
The agency and the United States Navy all said the aircraft landed on the lake just before landing on the track.
Some observers said the plane had crashed on the road.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
"That's a good thing," Jayne said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through the water that reached their waist through the emergency doors of a sinking plane.
He said the crew were frightened and shouted and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said crews working to improve the docks in close proximity also helped rescue them with a breathing boat to land before the plane sank at about 30 metres (100 ft)
Data from the Air Security Network shows 111 people have died in the crashes of PNG-registered aircraft over the past two decades but none have been involved with Air Niugini.
An analyst shows a record of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended on Saturday in a recurring case where a man accused of firing a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of psychiatric analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used cell phone records to combine the activities of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the tragedy.
Rowlett said he received local data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had the Chambers on the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claims, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my car was Nashville."
"Another misconception is that Tellis said he had known Chambers just two weeks before his death.
Telephone records indicate that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted text messages and Chambers' contact details from his phone.
"He's been looking for her all his life," Hale said.
It is planned to start its closing remarks on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?

Is there anyone else?!
New York home minister accuses a couple of being fired after a "colored" message
A New York-based homemaker accuses a couple of dismissing her on the grounds of discrimination after receiving a non-profit message from a mother complaining that she was "just another black man."
Couples refuse to be racists and compare the allegations to "scandalism."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern after discovering that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after the arrival of her first day of work in 2016.
"You're not going to get another person," wrote Mrs. Plasco - Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After discovering his faults, Plasco-Flaxman with "anxiety" dismissed Mrs. Maurice, saying that their departing minister, of African-American descent, had done a terrible job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing a couple for compensation relating to dismissal and wants a compensation of <0x24>350 a day for the sixth month, for living and working, though without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't have to act like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's racism."
The couple have denied allegations that they are biased, saying that stopping Maurice was the right move, fearing that they could no longer trust him after he had wronged him.
"My wife had sent me a message that she didn't want."
He's not racist.
We're not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if it is wrong?
Your child's?
Tell the truth."
Comparing the allegations to "trafficking," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had a baby and he was "in a very difficult situation."
"Would you want to kill someone like that?"
"That's not the right thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has accused the couple on social media, and attacked their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't prefer about the talking bear, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said regarding the letter: "It is difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who reads for the first time before it is published.
It's very exciting to know about Paddington's great success."
Speaking of his father, who worked as a camera attendant at the BBC before getting inspired to write a children's book from a small bear toy, he would have no negative feelings for his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "joyful and sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes him as "the most important member of our family," he added that his father was very pleased with his success.
"He was a man of words and he was not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was so important to him, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw Paddington's success in such a way.
Although it was his architecture and his ideas, he was always praising Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to call her on the phone.
After discovering that her daughter had been taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad was calling regularly and saying that the situation was very bad and was not expected to live," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad telling me that he would die in the next two minutes and I had to wait for him to say goodbye.
And I did so.
I said, "I love you, my son.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications the doctors had given him to keep his soul beating were gradually depleting in his system.
He had been dead for a while and this was just his system stopping working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to give up my life.
"Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded an airplane with other passengers - not knowing what she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I had my head bowed and my tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was when I was on the plane that I felt so sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women are trying to kill themselves in the middle of the road
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge with energizing messages and phone numbers that people can call.
His son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a hopeful cook and an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him by his name.
Everyone said his smile was a pleasure to everyone."
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was "a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will affect others."
Mrs. Davis created the card, "enabling people to know that there are people out there with whom you can go and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be quiet - you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old boyfriend Mark, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he was feeling bad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
"He was very low on Christmas Day - when the children were opening their gifts he didn't want to watch them eye to eye or communicate."
He said his death had brought them pain, but they had to struggle to keep living: "It puts a hole in the family.
It's depressing us.
But we all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's fate as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - a timely investigation, a magnitude - we could probably bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling" due to the complexity of the follow-up.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their time is a matter of time.
The election of representatives takes place only five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans are very weak, then they will be very weak in their efforts to put the person they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators, persuading them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are active.
It is not yet known whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will enable Mike Pence, vice president, to break the uniform and prove him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers "slow" under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un gained power seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's federal ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the highest control on the border between North Korea and China and the high rates of fines charged with human trafficking were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not given public opinion.
Most refugees from North Korea are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than an area with a large number of soldiers (demonstrated DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants instead of refugees and often force them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still literally in the war - have changed drastically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on disarmament talks.
The incident came after a historic summit in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed on a broader consensus to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without faith in the United States, there will be no faith and national security, and under such circumstances, there will be no way we will dismantle nuclear weapons first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi referred to Brett Kavanaugh as "independent" and said she would not serve in the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was "independent" and said he had so many feelings that he was not worthy to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were a woman who had done that way, they would say 'you can't control yourself,'" Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh completely denied allegations that he abused Dak Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the time of his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very empathetic, sometimes nearly screaming and depressed speaking about his family and his years in high school.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing charges against him as "disgusting and planned to destroy his reputation" organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he was discriminating against the Democrats.
"I think he is withdrawing for those words and how he denounced the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi did not refuse when asked if he would try to oust Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and if Democrats would be majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he should not only be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that if the Democrat was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Priceless Service Act or Roe's case against Wade, because he is said to be a conservative judge.
In his prosecution, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he could reverse some Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for an angry man, prejudice to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's not strange,'" said Pelosi.
Women should use it.
It's a good review of pain, months and years of more anger and can't get rid of it without crying.
"We're crying when we're upset," Ms Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, do you?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was working somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she could tell the person she was talking to, 'You can imagine I'm sad because I cry.
I was angry."
Then he continued to explain to me.
I thought it was a good idea."
Tears are allowed as a way to get rid of anger because they are basically incomprehensible.
One of my most memorable memories from my early career, was a office full of men, where I once found myself crying in an irrational rage, held the back of my neck by a big woman - a supervisor who I was always afraid of little - who pulled me up to the stairs.
"Don't let them see that you're crying," he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy with them and you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found with a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and resigned as a candidate, Mrs. Schroeder, he became very upset and saw there was no reason not to run for president.
"It wasn't a good decision," he told me while laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to this as the famous film "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time had gone too far, he was back in fundraising and he vowed he would not enter the race unless he raised <0x24>2 million.
It was a war that he lost.
He found that some of his followers who donated <0x24>1,000 to men would only give him <0x24>250.
"Do you think I'm going to pay a fee?" he asked.
When he gave his speech announcing that he could not launch an official campaign, he was filled with emotion for the people who helped him, confused by a system that made it extremely difficult to fund and target voters instead of delegates and angered him from gender discrimination until he became exhausted.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the media treated the incident.
"You would think the Kleenex company were my business sponsors.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my grave?
"He cried?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The earliest sounds in the trade war between the United States and China were very disturbing and although the war will not end soon, the differences between the countries may have been useful for Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year for taxing important Chinese sales including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most impactful diversity began this week with a new tariff affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of goods, tariffing half of all imports into the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent for <0x24>60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to monitor U.S. actions, and the second-largest economy does not seem to give up anytime soon.
Making Washington change the move means you have to accept the terms, but publicly admitting American pressure would be a big embarrassment to <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, trade war problems against the United States could help China for a long time by reducing dependency between the two countries.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create an environment that could start a change in the economy in any of its countries with greater risks than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia at the new U.S. Security Advisory Centre.
Syria 'prepared' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria has said it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by a seven-year war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the reality is more stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to repair the damaged areas by terrorists in order to restore regularity.
All situations now exist for the voluntary return of refugees to the country where they had to flee because of terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he emphasized that they do not want the assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the terrorism.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning the United States team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy again when Danish team captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time throughout the race, hit his first ball in the water in a 16-hole 3-hole hole, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his turn and became 1 in 4 to 5–0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by the lowest player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's first-class player, Dustin Johnson, was defeated 2 and 1 by England's Ian Poulter who probably played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Player in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the tournament with a score of 25.5 points in his games.
"I'm not crying, but I'm crying today.
It has been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm happy to win the cup again.
"What's important is the team and I'm happy I was able to help," Garcia said, who was overwhelmed with emotion after Europe's victory.
He transfers duties to fellow citizen John Ram who defeated American Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a one-man game on Sunday.
"I feel very proud, to defeat Tiger Woods, I was watching him as a child," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A statistical figure from one of the highest-level players ever, after winning 14 titles and becoming only the second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team weighed all weekend to keep the ball part of the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the highest level game in all competitions.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's bottom game, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
This morning, we had a lot of problems with the European team.
We fought.
A lot of respect for Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize ourselves, I will work with our US PGA federation and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will move on.
I love these 12 players and I'm happy to be a captain.
You've got to give a compliment.
They were protecting us."
