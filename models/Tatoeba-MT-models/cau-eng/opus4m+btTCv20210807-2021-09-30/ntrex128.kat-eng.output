Wales Assembly members express similarity to “brow ropes (muppet)”
Some members of the assembly are seriously concerned with the proposal, their present title will change under the name of MWP (EU Parliament).
The issue arose because it is planned to change the name of the assembly as a Parliament of Wales.
Members of different political directions of the Assembly are so excited that they can become objects of ridicule
One Labour member of the Assembly says that his group is worried that “it is a nation of Twp and Pwp.”
For a non-real reader: in Wales means twp-graining, and pwp belts.
And one member of the assembly said that his team was not happy, and he presented several alternative names.
Wales’s Conservatives said they “opened,” met a new name, but noticed that MWP was very similar to the word Muppet (Bride Dolls TV series in the UK).
In this context, the Italian letter w will appear as u letter in York City.
The Assembly Commission, which currently works on the draft law for the introduction of a new name, says: “The final decision on any definition of the name of the members of the Assembly, of course members themselves are accepted.”
Under the decision of the Government of Wales, the Wales Assembly received the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public review of variants, where extensive support for the assembly was granted a proposal to the Parliament of Wales.
As for the ranks of members of the Assembly, the Commission has filed a name “The Member of the Parliament of Wales,” or WPM, but the MWP option has received more support when public discussion.
Members of the Assembly are still choosing alternative options, so the achievement of consensus will be the concern of the Chairman Elne Jones, who should present the bill for several weeks.
The reform draft Assembly also includes other changes, including the scheme of disqualification of members of the Assembly and the committees system.
Members of the Assembly will make the final decision on the draft law during debates.
The Macedonians spend a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday voters decide whether the country's new name is \"The Republic of North Macedonia.\"
The berries were appointed for decades due to the current dispute with neighboring Greece, because they also have a province called Macedonia.
Athenian has long proven that his northern neighbor in this name expresses the claim in his territories and constantly contradicts the share of his membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedon's president George Ivanov, the opponent to replace the pulscite of the name, says he does not pay attention to the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply the fee for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s church calls were made because it was hard for churches to find church in Harlem
“The people I talked to say they were historically in every neighborhoods of the bar and church,” said Mr. Adams.
“There’s no one anymore now.”
He said that the bars are clear.
Today, “people communicate differently,” he said.
“The barbars are no longer a place of darkness, where neighbors are constantly walking.”
As for churches, it is fear that the money received by the sale of assets does not affect how leaders suggest, “and later they will come to the place where they have started.”
Churches can be replaced by cooperative residential buildings, where people will be settled, who will not take care of the temples remaining in the neighborhood, adding it.
“The majority of the owners of these buildings will be white,,” he said, “that they will speed up the day when all these churches are on the same day, because the people in these cooperative buildings will not become a parishion of these churches.”
Both churches were built up until there until Harlemi became black-black metropols - the church of the city community in 1870, and St. Martin - ten years later.
The initial white Methodist congregation was settled from the 1930s.
Black congregation gained the right to the building nearby.
St. Martin’s church gained a high-quality congregation under John Howard Johnson, who came to the head of Boycott Harlem's main shopping district, 125th street, traders who refused to take and encourage black people.
1939 Bolsh fired the building greatly damaged, but since the recovery plan developed by Father Johnson’s parish, they called them.
Worthy David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and heir to this Carlyson pride called “a remake of calls for the poor people.”
In July, Carlyon’s performer called him another name: “Courturian Treasures” and “Unforgettable Historical Instrument.”
Tifhan Ging, an expert from Michigan University, also noted that it was a carillion performed by Dionio A. Linden, the first black musician in the world, which moved to the church of Ryversidad over 18 years ago.
Mr. Merweller said that St. Martin’s church did not change it.
During the last months in St. Martin’s church, which was performed by architects and contractors, part of the church’s capelian assistants, by the Diocese of the rest of the Bishop’s Diocese.
The Council of Church - the governing body of the church, consisting of the support of Capelian - in July, the Diocese of the Diocese was aware that the Diocese had been awarded expenses for the Council of Church, although the latter was not involved in the rent of architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Part of the traffic was reported due to lack of transparency of the Diocese party.

His exile is a artistic punishment for many cultural and religious art of England due to his fantastic filament and destruction of the Tatabian followers.
But the Cromwell Society calls B-N Boxing as \"Sissoules\" and described as \"the attempt to rewrite history.\"
John Goldstein, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, says: “The statues were inevitable in the present debates that outside the Westminster Palace, Oliver Cromwell’s monument would become a target.
Struggle with traditional belief in England's civil wars is neither command nor carried out.
It may be another crocodile punishable for the actions that his ancestor Thomas committed in the previous century.
The perfect work of Sir William A. A. D. A. A. Tornicoffot is a wonderful confirmation of the 19th-century attitude towards the Cromwell and is part of the history of the personality that belongs to many.
Mr. Goldstein told The Sunday Telegraph: “Can be more in the late 19th century than today, but still, many of the Croveli consider it as the defender of the Parliament’s external pressure when the monarch attacks.
Historical debates about how accurate this idea lasts yet.
One thing that can happen to us is that the conflict in the 17th century led to further development of our nation, and the Cromwell was an important representative of one side.
His, as Lord Defender, achievements also deserve to celebrate and honor.

More than 20 million people were looking at a high court candidate Breth Kawaano and a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blaz Ford, six television networks.
Meanwhile, political confrontations continued, broadcasts in the program decided to change the last second of Friday: the agreement is organized by the Arzone Senator Jeff flutes for FBI, one-week investigation was carried out.
Ford told the Senate's legal committee that it was 100 percent confident that Kawaano was drunk with his hands and tried to make his clothes on the senior party.
Kavano, in an emotional display, said that it's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It seems that more than 20,4 million people were watching this, says Nielsen’s report published on Friday.
The company counted the average rate of ears on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
There was not instantly available data from other networks that were also transmitted to this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And also, Nielsen, it's usually hard to determine the number of people who watch the transmissions in the offices.
To evaluate objectively, this is the number of people who watch football flute games or the Oscar Prize ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose experts warmly supported the appointment of Kavno on average 5,69 million viewers all day between other channels, said Nielsen.
The result of ABC was 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3,1 million, 2,94 million, MSNBC, 2,89 million, and CNN had 2,52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
After listening, interest was high maintained.
The main character of the Friday drama was the flute.
After the departure of the Republican Office, the Republican Office officially told the press that it would vote in favor of Karateno, CNN and CBS Chambers reported on Friday morning when the opposers shouted him to enter the elevator for hearing the legal committee.
He stood for a couple of minutes until he quarreled, broadcasted by CNN.
“I’m standing before you,” she told a woman.
“Do you think he tells the truth to the country?
He said, “You have power, when so many women are weak.”
Fleick said that his office had published a statement and said before an elevator was closed, he could say more about hearing the committee.
Cable and broadcast networks were directly transferred after a few hours when the legal committee should hold a vote to the Caucasusn candidate for voting for the entire Senate.
But Fleick said, I will do this only if I know that FBI will study the charges against the candidate after a week, which they express the minority of democrats.
Féck was partly convinced of his friend who spoke to the demo Senator Chris Kun.
After talking to the Kun and after talking with several other Senator, Fleick made a decision.
The choice of flute was power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not vote without investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation to find out the accusations against Kawano.

The tsunami was followed by a earthquake of 7.5 magnetic earthquakes
“When Tsinam first appeared yesterday, people were not immediately fleeing and stayed on the beach and became victims of this disaster,” said a speaker at the Indonesian accident organization, Sutopo Porovo Nugroho, in Jakarta.
In this case, only the tsunami had no place, he was shipping cars, wood wateres, houses and everything that had happened to him in the way,” Nugoroho said, and said that before harm to the beach, the tsunami would have been 800 km/h (47 miles/h) speed.
He said that some of the trees have risen to their survival, and this method has been lucky.
About 16,700 human Evacuation traded in a palu 24 different centres.

Communication was fully limited in the field of information transfer between Dongala and other areas, saying Nugrohom.
In this area, 300,000 people live in this area, said the Red Cross, adding that their volunteers and employees are going to the place of an accident.
“It’s a tragedy, but it might be worse,” they said.
On Saturday, the agency acted under a rather big criticism for delivering untimely information about the disaster that struck the city of Plu, the agencies said that the waves were put into another city when the alarm letter was still new.
On a shared content on social network, it is possible to see a man standing on the roof, trying to warn the population and make them sound about the coming waves.
In just a few minutes, a huge stream of water came to the coast and took buildings and cars.
Information agencies were unable to take appropriate measures in time.
The earthquake and the tsunami damaged the power source between the cities, and it actually made it impossible for officials to change information.
The soldiers started sending primary aid aircraft to Jakarta and other cities, in the accident zone, but the victims still need food and other primary consumption items.
The city airport will be re-paid only for emergency cases and will return to the usual working mode only in October.
President Joko Willdo plans to visit the police center on Sunday.
The height of the culprit in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Mr. Dosba said that when World Vision employees were going to doangala to palu, they had to look at merry scenes and places rather than reach them in special places for defense.

It's not yet happened.
“It’s still a low non-conventional accident,” said Alia Alia, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.

After the earthquake and tsunami of the Friday day, the second night, lost friends and family members again hoped that the chance of survival of their loved ones still existed, and the dark traces left by the natural disaster would not remain forever in their lives.

U.S. needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
Kai-fu Li, inventor and artificial intelligence practitioner, who has experience in working with companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, said something that China becomes more active in the artificial intelligence aspect, the United States must double the amount of money spent on research.
This comment was published after the various parts of the American government made a statement regarding artificial intelligence, and emphasized the fact that America has no formal strategy formulated on this topic.
At that time China presented his plan yet last year: He plans to become an artificial intelligence number one leading state by 2030.
For studies, money will be a good start for the U.S., considering how many other countries are behind this aspect of the United States and we are also expecting new achievements,” Lee said.
The double of funds will further increase the chances that further discovery will be in America when you write an interview with CNBC on the current week.
Lee, whose book is the superpowers of art intelligence: China, Silk Road and the world's new formation - was published this month by Houghton Hollin Harcourt, an executive director of SInovation Ventures, a company that invests in one of China's largest artificial intelligence organizations.
In the 1980s, he worked on artificial intelligence systems that defeated American top-ranking players at Carnegie Mellon University, later he was a president of Microsoft Research and a president of Google China branch.
Li Sympathy was expressed to the technological competitions held by the American government, such as the competition of robots working in defense systems, and was interested in when the next event would be held, to make the future perspectives even better.
Lim said that researchers in America often need quite a lot of work to be able to obtain grants.
No China takes us into academic leaders; but corporations, he said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies are paying successful figures to work with them on artificial intelligence.
Lim also said that immigration reforms can also sign up for the development of artificial intelligence.
You think, green cards should automatically be able to force people with the degree of artificial intelligence,” he said.
China State Consulate presented its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
Lim noted that the Chinese Natural Sciences Foundation funded scientists, like state agencies, and can receive these funding from American citizens, but the quality of research is lower than China.
At least recently, the Department of Defense in the United States has established the United Artificial Intelligence Center, the main goal of which is to unite people in the industrial and academic aspects. And the White House has announced the preparation for the establishment of the artificial intelligence committee and choosing members of its committee.
The organization DARPA also announced the investment of 2 billion dollars, which they intend to implement in the project called AI Next.
In addition to the organization NSF, DAPRA invests 100 million each year with an artificial intelligence.
Nevertheless, the U.S. legislature body, which was asked to create a security committee to figure out artificial intelligence, did not reconcile any step in this month.
The Macedonian citizens will participate in the referendum, which is related to the change of country’s name
On Sunday, the Macedonians participated in the referendum, where their desire to express their desire to be changed to their country’s name and to become the Republic of Northern Macedonia, the same step would be solved by a ten-year conflict that is going between Macedonia and Greece, and which prevents Macedonia from entering the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province of Macedonia, said that Macedonia claims to claim a claim on its behalf in Greece.
Representatives of these two countries agreed on changing the name in July, but the nationalist opponents claim that such action, the Slavonic origin of the Macedonians, and the price will lose.
President George Ivanov said that he is not going to participate in the referendum, thus he claims the boycott and the employment of those publishers who try to prevent 50 percent thresholds.
The following question was written on the newsletter issued at the referendum: “We want NATO and EU membership through the treaty agreement with Greece”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said that this is the price required to pay for the EU and NATO, because Macedonia is one of the countries that was formed as a result of the collapse of Yugoslav.
I came to vote for the future of the country to vote for young people who will be able to live peacefully under the EU shield, for this means more secure for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievsk in Skopka.
Despite the essence of the legislature, Parliament’s members have said they will wait for the results of elections and observe if the number of votes will be decisive for the country.
The country’s name needs to be replaced by the Parliament for more than two-thirds of votes.
The Election Commission said that no report for 1 hour was reported for the evening.
However, only 16 percent of the population have been declared, which is significantly lower compared to 2016 elections, where 34 percent of the population have already announced, and 66 percent have finally fixed its opinion on the bulleten.
“I came here to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” José Tevneski said, 62, from the capital of Scopire.
Macedon's Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorka and son Ducom supported the change of name to Macedonia, which will open the country’s way to NATO and the EU, Macedonia 30 September, 2018.
At this time, in front of the Parliament, Vladimir Kakakov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage, carrying chairs and placed them, before the tents, for those who were against the referendum.
We would like to join them in NATO and the European Union, but we would like to join these organizations at the expense of helping others.
“We are a poor country, but we have worth it.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can become members of Russia and China and the European Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said that integration in NATO will bring more benefits to Macedonia, the country in which the unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent.
It is believed that most people will make this choice because 80 percent of the country will agree with NATO and the European Union,” Zaev said when filling his newsletter.
He said that Ike will be the result that will confirm our future.
According to the survey published last Monday, which Macedon Research Institute conducted, 30-43 percent of the population will take part in the referendum - which does not meet the requirements.
According to the second survey conducted by McEdon Telma TV, 57 percent of the population are planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of respondents are going to give a positive answer to the referendum.
You need 50 percent plus one sound to complete your referral success.
The failure in referendum is one of the greatest disadvantages of pro-Western government, for they came to power in May last year.

He fell in love with three players in Brussels than he would find himself in an open space.
After that, Aguero turned out to be surrounded by four green T-shirt players.
He's surrounded by one of the defenders rather than to attend others, and he would find himself with the side of the eleven-meter line.
After that, he handed the ball to sterling.
Sternalg used the first touch to return the ball to Aguero, and Aguuero was able to walk right for the Brigton goalkeeper, for Mattu Ryan, to score in the right corner of the goal grid.

Trump is driving through Western Virginia.
President Almaty spoke about the events around Bret Kanauf around the highest court when he spoke about the situation of the Republican Party, which had them during the mid-election period.
“All that we have done will result in November.
Just five weeks away, from the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the largest, greatest events -- I'm pretending I don't mind, but I actually stand up, and that's why I'm trying to fight these great candidates in every place, he said.
Trump also added, “You see the terrible, terrible groups of democrats, and you're watching this torture.
They try to return power using all efforts, you can see this inconspicuous and contaminant.
They don't care about whom they're affected by who they're going to take control of, the main thing is to gain power and control, that's exactly what they want to control and we're not going to give them to them.
He said that the current main mission of democrats is to maintain and resist it.
“And you can see that during the last four days,” he said, and responded to democrats, how angrys, rudes, and non-sandon are they.”
In addition, he applied to the Senate’s court committee. He applied to the democrats Senator Diana Feinstein, who received a rather noisy feedback from the participants.
Do You Recall His Answer?
Did the official documents from you?
Ah, Ah, what?
No Ah no, - it was the most bad body language -- the worst thing I've seen before.
He will not leave the church anymore.
He's non-tolerant to those who speak what he thinks
When my party's driving force activists gave my censorship a voice, I was very surprised.
After all, on the Labour MP list, I'm the last one who doesn't want to accept -- and that's all because of what I think.
My Parliament colleague Joan Ryan received a similar response because he resiliently went against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship movement has been criticized by Jeremy Corbin's consent.
Jeremy’s predecessor leaders did not agree on the same topics as providing responsible economic policy on the state’s initial agencies, Europe and similar problems.
The letter of the attending participants at the East Notinge meeting was concluded -We have a meeting to be inclusive and productive.
8 years after being a local MP, the Friday night meeting was just like that.
Unfortunately, the meetings were not held on the same tone today and were forgotten by politics if they ever existed.
It is quite clear that it has an intangible attitude towards the Labour Party, and each opinion is criticized only according to whether it agrees to party leaders.
This soon began after Jeremy became a leader as a colleague from me expected that I would change my opinion on various issues and take a position that I never agreed to live - I wanted to have a state defense topic on the EU’s single trade.
When I speak publicly - it's hard to have all this meaning - in the social network, this is quite large violence on the social network, with the request of the pre-election, the collapse of the political center and the request to exit my party.
And it's not just my experience.
On the contrary, I even think of myself, for something, there's still a political part of my comments towards me.
I find myself in the professionalism and efforts of colleagues who have to listen to sexist or raceal calls every day, but they will never want to.
In today's politics, it is disappointing that such violence has become normal for us.
Jeremy Chabney said last week that Labour Party should have established a tradition of tolerance culture.
And the reality is that we are no longer like the church, and every unsustainable step or change in changing the party's interior makes it even narrower.
During the past two years, I received a lot of advice to rejoice in myself, not to increase my voice, and in just similar circumstances, everything would be fine.
But that's not what I've done in politics.
Since 32 years ago, I became a member of the Labour Party as a student, and this decision was caused by the policy taken by the Techer, which was slided by the classroom system, I was aimed at serving them in the field of civil services that it needs most - to be a local representative or as a minister of government.
I never hide my policy, even last election.
In Eastern notes, someone could not be confused with my political position, and I agreed to the relationship that I was then with the current ruling party.
To give them a Friday meeting, the only thing I would like to say is that when your country comes to Brexit, which can damage real estate, business and civil service, I can’t guess why you’d want to spend time and energy on similar loyal attitude towards the leader of the Labour Party.
But one message that I've noticed is not for members of the nominal movement, but for my colleagues, Labours and others: I am proud that I have the opportunity to ship you and promise that no threat or bad political intention can prevent me from doing everything that I believe is serving your best interests.

Emir 38 - 17 Melowus: Unexpected Eri Tablo's Head
The last two meetings could have had some influence on the final result, but no doubt that Emir would deserve the triumph that this team reached the tenent premiere with today's game.
Now they're in the head of Tablo, the only left between ten teams.
Finally, using their good protection and chances, the team was able to establish a dominant position at home, so he could have trained Peter Marsh.
During each game, we have checked the possibilities, and we are still defeated, that is why we have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie, from Melrow, said: “Honoring Eir, they used the odds better than us.”
At the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's attempt, which was created by Fitzer Climo, was formed by Eyri, but for Scottish captains, Horri Hiug, gave her a wide dress for Vorororor and allowed Melrouz and Jason Begott to use the odds.
After that, Climum was able to increase the advantages of Eyir before the end of the first half and made the score 17-5.
Melrows started the second half quite well. That's why, with Patrick Anderson's confidence and Bagot's finish, they were able to reduce their advantage to five points.
It was followed by a serious tragedy of Roard Not, who had to leave the square, but Eir was still able to cut away and perform a clear transformation by making MacDonaleva.
Eyri's active captain Blake MacFreyson received a yellow card again, as a result of which Melowus made an unsuccessful attempt to convert players through big pressing.
At home, players were able to play in the game, and when Truan Hachison won the yellow card for the Czech Republic, MacFerson was able to get the ball and get Eir Mau.
The climan was able to go back to the ball, and he managed to do it every time, after the Kaley Roum David Armstroang Bobk sent Grgoro Hanri to his home at the fifth time of the players.

‘The sea is ours’: The landlocked Bolivia hopes that the trial will release the path to the quiet ocean
Seafarers pay off to La Paza
Dark blue flags on public institutions.
The marine bases are the following mottothia volume from capitaka: the sea is ours.
His return is our duty.
Bolvia's failure is due to the 19th-century conflict that ended with Chile's blood vessels - this is why the grief of this conflict is still seen in a quiet ocean.
After five years of discussions, Bolivia is looking forward to the decision of the International Court of Ellis, which should be made on October 1st.
“Bolivia has momentum, feeling of unity and clarity, and of course, a positive answer to Moel,” said Roberto Kalasdila, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivia is going to live live on the international trial, and of course most of them believe that, after decades Chile will be attacked by the country to establish negotiations and give out exit to the sea.
Euro Morales, the patriarchal president of Bolivia - who has the next year's election for the future - also has its opinion on Monday’s process-making.
“We are very close to the return of the Pacific,” said last August.
But part of analysts think that the chances of making decisions in favor of Bolivia are very low, and if this chance was justified, there is nothing to change.
One of the centers based in the Netherlands has no influence on Chile territory, and said that their intervention does not affect any of these negotiations.
The International Court said that the judgment comes out of the final hearing in six months, which means that the case was not-replaced, “Paz Zaraman, an international law  Chili expert.
And the improvement of the Bolivia's case could even be seen even behind the last four years.
“The return case of the return of the lower exit was taken by the Bolivian administration,” said Zaraem.
The smoker’s mood may even have even increased even the last drop of Chile’s well-being, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but their extensions will be very difficult after all.
These two countries will not send ambassadors to each other in 1962.
The former President of Bolivia and the representative of the country in Haaga, Edwardo Rodriguez Welt, rejected the opinion that the process carried out by the court was unusually fast.
Monday will give Bolivia a chance to explain new opportunities for new relationships with Chile -- and will give the chance to settle 139 years of disagreements with both sides,” he said.
Kalsadila also denied that Latino is one of the most popular presidents of Latino American America -- used a conflict as a political facilitator.
He added: “I have never had the opportunity to go to the Pacific, and I have never had to go to the Pacific.”
The return is a chance to prove that we have come out of the past.
North Korea said that the nuclear disparation process does not begin until they do not trust America
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Rong Hom, said they will never harm atomic weapon than they trust Washington.
Ram spoke on the United Nations Assembly on Saturday
He urged the United States to go to promise that during the summit held in Singapore, two rivals between the country.
Of course, the United States also made a comment. State Secretary, Mike Pompeo three months ago, on the verge of negotiations in Singapore, Kim Jong Un.
R says that the sanctions issued by the Americans and the declaration of the end of the war with Korea is an empty dream that the North Korean would go to work.
U.S. Declaration plans to agree rather than step towards the first step.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
On the other hand, there's a skeptic point that Pylenic seriously thinks of rejection of the weapon, for this is the only way that he believes in the way leading to peace.
Pompeo plans to visit Pupenian in the next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Tramp.

John Edward: The possession of foreign languages is an important skill for citizens of the world
The Scottish Independent Schools Association is monitoring the results of academic success, and this process will continue in 2018, by paying attention to good academic performances, which will further grow in sports, art, music and other public benefits.
A representative of schools drawn from 30,000 students, consular (SCIS) of the Scottish Independent Schools, and they will always achieve the highest level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers and the world for being a citizen.
As an educational sector that is able to compile relevant curicula in schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and demanding thing in the future, which will be chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in the language he hears, he will directly reflect his mind.
If you talk to his mother in his native language, it goes straight to heart.
This once again reminds us that only English can not exist, when we try to build relationships and trust with representatives of different countries.
Among independent schools, the results of exams over the past years are unique that foreign languages are distinguished by higher scores and rating.
68 percent of students of foreign languages have received the highest score A.
According to the data collected from SCIS partner 74 schools, 72 percent of students took the highest score in Chinese when 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students also received higher assessments.
This once again represents the fact that Scottish independent schools support the development of foreign languages as the most important skills for the future of children.
The languages currently pay much attention to STEM (science, technology, engineering mathematics) subjects in independent schools and other places.
The UK employment survey revealed in 2014, that 17 percent of the applicants refrain from submitting the application due to the language barrier.
So more and more attention is paid to foreign languages to prepare young people for future careers.
The number of jobs in the global world increases in different languages, the greater the demand for these skills.
Despite the career choices, if someone learns another language, they will have a real advantage in the future to have you always used the skills you need.
Communication with a person from another nationality in his native language, a person will always step forward in the field of employment.
According to youGov survey, between 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not communicate in any other language, and 15 percent could only lead a simple dialogue into French.
And now when language learning is important for our children, we're going to invest in this matter.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those countries who have a growing economy will equip children with skills that will be important for their employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different according to foreign language classes.
The part of the school concentrates in popular classical languages, when the second part is concentrated in languages that will be important for the United Kingdom by 2020, and these languages are Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever it is, interest in your child is always manifested in the language that will interest him and be able to learn from experienced employees and specialists.
Scottish independent schools are striving for the creation of the desired learning environment for children, and they want to equip them with all the necessary skills they need in the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a big role in economic development of the country, and they all need to reflect on education.
Moreover, foreign languages should be considered as a means for international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer choices, diversity and highest quality for students.
It should be done.
John Edwards is the Director of Independent Schools of Scotland

To prepare, at this stage of career I don't need presonic games, he said.
The speech of Trump West Virginia, the Yutub Channel
President Donald Trump starts the election campaign series today in Winling, West Virginia.
Among the five meetings planned next week, this is the first talk of Trump and then there are places in the destination list such as Tens and Missions.
The letter requested to fill the highest court is confirmed by Trump going to create support for intermediate elections, for something in republics there is a risk of losing control in Congress, in November.
What is Trump's West Virginia meeting and how do we watch it online?
Trump Village's West Virginia Meeting was celebrated for 7 hours. Today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the channel link below to Trump.
At a large meeting, Trump will present the nominees of the Supreme Court Bret Kawaanauf, which had been involved in a conflict related to sexual violence in the last few days.
But the main goal of these meetings is to gain some confidence for the November election.
Accordingly, Trump’s campaign office said that the following five meetings are aimed at strengthening and supporting the sales case, for the Republicans try to protect the majoritarians and further strengthen them in the home of the Senate and representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congression control is important for the President’s plan as possible during the ongoing election campaign in more states,” said Trump’s campaign spokesperson who refused to be called Reuters.
According to the Western Virginia Metro News, the meeting that will be held at the Whisbanque Stadium in Winling may be based on supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and all of this will be reflected in the pitzburg media, “
Last month, Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which she won more than 40 percent of her advantage in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Senate candidate for West Virginia Republican Party, Patrick Morris, whose results range from the surveys.
“It’s not a good sign for a man when the precedent goes to attract his supporters,” says Simon Heder, a political scientist from West Virginia University.
Ridder Cup 2018: The United States team is preparing to go to an individual tournament on Sunday
After the three-sided season, four-sided competitions on Saturday evening could be what they needed for so long.
The change in the push and fate is a completely fictional model in sports, but athletes still rely on it, especially in the competition like the Knight Cup.
Neta what will they say now, where is their momentum?
We had a six-point advantage, and now four, so we would like to see this as a little bit,” said Jordan Spit, who left the destination today.
Of course, Europe has four additional points and a chance to obtain another twelve points.
Americans, as Spit says, feel that they feel very little about fear, because they have a lot of motivation before the game, this shows the level of the game of Spit and Justin Tomas, who studied together and gained three points from four to three.
The spit was in the framework of the entire field of distrust, and it's just for this example.
After the solemn series, it became even louder, because Tomas and Spit had two points.
In 15 of his victory, he brought a similar call to victory, saying that Americans were not going to go out of the championship.
One of the things that you're going to do is to concentrate on and play your own, said Spit.
This is what each player is staying for this moment.
18 doubles are left.
The only players who have more than a spin and Tomas score, Francesco Molynar and Tom Flakeud, a rival story from the Knight Cup.
In Europe, however, it is not a big advantage, but a wonderful couple put four out of the four and cannot get rid of it.
This is the only thing they did not go to Boge, nor on Saturday evening, they left themselves in the morning of Boge’s Saturday, Friday evening and Friday morning at nine o’clock.
Depending on the meeting, and according to the energy that both players have, it is obvious that the viewers do not stay funny, that no player will pay for European victory and the sun will definitely be placed on the Le Golf National or on Molinari.
Maybe both of them, but they're going to make a difference.
But it's still not possible to talk about European fame.
Buba Votson and Web Wampson performed a small job from Serkhio Garcia, a four-point hero of the morning, which started with Alex Norden.
Boge and two double points gained Spanish and throw Sweden, and they never been so close to gaining advantage.
But on Sunday, there's no one who will be able to use it out of your pit.
Four-sided games and couples are very interesting earring, because they look at couples’ relationships with advice they give each other and the strategy that they might suddenly change.
Europe really played a better game as a team and gained a noticeable advantage for the last day, but the U.S. team also showed that they have a perspective to fight and do not plan to stand on the page, so everything is still suspicious.
For the final day of the Radider Cup, Europe acquires 10-6 advantages
Europe will have a great advantage on the final day, since they lost the United States team over the weekend and gained 10-6 victories.
Tom Fletwood and Francesco Molinar Duet won the victory on Taiwan Vuds, trying to run a pair on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bourne, from Europe, suspects that he will be able to return the bowl that he won two years ago, for Europe dominated America with a morning pair of couples and won a 3--1 victory.
The United States need more endurance, despite the two victories they cannot reach the end of their goal
Jim Far team needs eight points from 12 weeks to earn a cup.
Flifjo is the first European freshman who was able to win a four-point, after he and Molynarari won a sensational victory in Moliwood and approached the Knight Cup sensational victory,
After the defeat of Vuds and Patrick Reid, their main goal is to defeat American new-born, Brasson Demembaus with a 5&4 choking advantage.
Although Woods showed an extraordinary game on Saturday, she lost 19 out of 29 games, where she lost seven times.
Justin Rose had a rest for Archia in the morning four-point, he is a partner of Henryk Stanson, with whom he lost 2&1 in his path to St. Johnson and Brooks in his coepka - number one and third players in the world.
Paris had no simple games in South West Europe.
The winners of the three road, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas had a two-point limit after playing with Americans after the Saturday game.
They won Spain, John Ram and Jan Poulter, and then returned to defeat the Poulter and Rory Macklar 4&3 account, where the couple lost the solvent first two times.
During the whole history, it was only twice made from the team’s four-point back, and it should be noted that the FIuri team only needs to equalize points to gain victory.
Two days after the best stay in a row, counter attack is expected more than a week.
North Korea declares that in no case, they are not going to be mutually unresponsive, without gaining confidence
During the conversation with the United Nations, the North Korean Foreign Minister stated that the sanctions imposed even more distrust towards the U.S. and in similar situations do not intend to distrust nuclear weapons.
Rong Hom told the general assembly of the world that China has taken over-the-good steps, and has stopped nuclear and military weapons tests, their further well-trained study and thought that they would not spread atomic weapon and atomic technology.
“But we can’t see the relevant answer and action from the U.S.,” he said.
We cannot trust in our state without trust in trust in the United States and because of similar conditions, we are not going to be the first.
When Rie was making a statement about what they had to resist in the U.S.A., it seemed to have been a sharp act that he did not fully deny a single disarming action that Pyrenyan carried two years ago.
Ram also noted Kim Yong Un and Donald Trump in Singapore, on June 12, the summit agreements and disadvantages held on June 12, where Kim had promised Trump to work on the collapse of the Kore Peninsula, when Trump promised him the security of North Korea.
North Korea will reach the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyzenyan should first get the nuclear weapons.
Washington also refrained from the conversation on the removal of sanctions imposed on North Korea.
It requires the adoption of the first sentence from the Korean side, and increasing the implementation of the given goal in the form of sanctions, as well as the declaration of the completion of the sanctions of the sanctions,” Rem said.
It is simply a dream for those who have no idea about us.
But the problem is that the current sanctions deepen our distrust.
What did not mention about the plans of the second summit planned between Kim and Trump, which the American leader highlighted the United Nations at the meeting on Sunday.
Instead, the Minister emphasized three meetings held during the last five months with the South Korean leadership Mun Chje-in, adding: “The problem of anti-Western was the problem, instead of South Korea, the Korean Peninsula would not be so difficult.”
The General Assembly, which focused on the United States and North Korean talks, became irreplaceable after the wicked president Trump, called Trump, a man of suicide mission.
This year the United States meeting, Trump, promised by the full destruction of Kim and North Korea last year, praised the North Korean leader, but noted that more to do and sanctions continue to act than Korea did not begin the disarmament process.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time to do this, if it would take two years, three or five months - no matter.
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Consulate must be awarded to the Plenary step forward.
When the United States Secretary told United Nations security consulate on Thursdays, that the security consulate should continue to carry out a single-lined command without any failure to finally confirm the difference.
The security consulated the North Korea’s sanctions in 2006 to limit and reduce funding in the aspects of the development of nuclear and firearms for Pyenyan.
Pompeo met with what the United Nations was meeting and told him he would come down to Pkhaenian for the next month to plan the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times in the current year, but his last meeting was not enough.
He left Pyzenyan in July saying that progress has only reached North Korea by forming his/her own essential needs.
North Korea promised to look at the process of disarmament during the current month and take necessary measures.
Rém is told that Kim told him that he would have to deal with the measures that he was striving for is a security guarantees that Trump promised him in Singapore and where he promised to establish a relationship with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on sufficient rest
Harvard University gave all students a special course that concentrates on teaching students sufficiently to rest, while the trend of ‘night’ and caffeine addiction is developing day-to-day.
Academicians have discovered that students who study at the number one university are not even aware of how to call themselves.
Charles Tsizler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigrim and Women's Hospital, created this course that is the first in the United States.
He started a similar course since he decided to understand how much he has an impact on sleep disorders.
'After one meeting, one girl came to me and said, 'Why do you tell me this now, my final year?'
He said no one told him about the need to sleep before he said, \"That's what I'm going to do,\" he told me.
The course took up this year, and its main goal is to explain how much of the students have a great impact on the academic and sporting of a good sleep manner, and also on the health condition in general.
Paul Barera, Professor of Psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and CEO of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to present a similar course after seeing how many children had a broken sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes an interactive task pack.
One of the sections contains various items such as coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books and follow the effects of caffeine and sun rays, and how their results affect sports performance, and what is the importance of sleep routine.
At another section, participants are asked what level of sleep is possible to develop a chance of infarct, tumors and depression.
The map placed on campus, with its signs, gives a uncle to students to think about their blog routine.
'We know that it doesn't change all the actions of students' behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as they know what the results come from smoking cigarettes,\" Professor Sizler said.
The culture of ‘the night’ is still there, he said, and he added that modern technologies and students are even more likely to increase sleep disorders.
Good, quality sleep should be the secret weapon of ‘Students’ in order to fight stress, overheat and irritation - as well as to avoid vomiting, for the lack of sleep, our body is hungry and makes them constantly hungry.
Reymond Sou, a 19-year-old Caliphorene, who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Sizler's course, after Soum passed one class with a professor last year.
He said that the course gave him a clear eyes, and he gave motivation to create a pharmthe swimming course.
The next step in his hope is to ask all graduates to go through a similar course than they will still be engaged in the training environment.
Professor Sizler recommends students to set alarms before bedtime as well as wake up, as in his opinion, students should avoid ‘blue light’ by electric screens and LED light reflect, and can significantly change the rhythm of the heart, which leads to further sleep disorders.
Livingston 1 - 0 Reyngers: Mengana wins the goal of Jerry's boys
Reinჯერ has experienced another failure after Dol Menga Gold defeated Stephen Jerry's team with a score of 1-0.
Ibrox side waited for the first victory to fix the first victory, after 4-1 victory on Saint Johnstoun last February, but Gary Holt’s team could compete with Jerry and he left his second failure on the position of the manager in 18 games and left his team behind eight points in the heart of Premier League leaders.
Menige blows up seven minutes before the end of the first half and broke the line of reinventers, which had not been at the height of the invitation before the end of the first half.
When Reinჯერs were listed in the sixth place, Lyvingston took the third place, and only one goal is to go beyond Hiberniyan.
And in addition, the reiner may have an additional problem, since the player of their main composition was injured in the head of the pen of the spenc.
Gerard carried out eight changes during the game in that part of the team that Eir was able to score in the fourth final of the BetFred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, passed the same 11-year-old who brought him the score last week, and he was grateful for how his player's form leads to each meeting.
Maybe Ringer had more possession of the ball, but Lyvingston made more of this ball than them.
Two minutes before the reinventer's rule, you should have taken it two minutes before menga would be able to put the ball first for Scott Pittman, but the attack of Reynger, the opponent's midfielder broke down.
Kigan Jakobs' penalty blow reached the skiper creg but the defending player, Alan Litgoum was able to send the ball back.
Reinger was able to gain possession again, but eventually they did not hope but believed more.
Alfredo Morello believed that he would give him the chance to hit the penalist after Stephen Loules, but the referee asked him to have a flag.
Reingers managed to run two shots in the first half of the game, but for the opponent teamkeeper, Liam Kelly was not so difficult for Lasana and Ovie Ejaria.
At this point, a solvent shot of Lyvingston could have been decisive at the 34th minute, and no one can deny it.
Reingers were not able to deal with the deep defense of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't do anything for Dexlan Galer handed the ball to Robinson, who selected the ball and handed Menga to finish the attack.
Gerard changed the break by Ryan Kent and changed his change on the flang but the block made from the defending player broke everything.
But Lyvingston could still maintain the desired pace and destroy the opponent, using long pases of the iligou and halet.
The Holt team could find advantage in the last time, but in the MakGregori square it was hard to stand, and each person performed by Jacobs was not able to run out rather than to take a corner from the far away.
Reinჯერs change, Glenn Medleton also requested the appointment of Penalta at the end of the game, but the referee refused to do so.

AIDS: China talks about 14% of new cases
China announced that the number of AIDS virus people increased by 14%.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, they say representatives of the Ministry of Health.
About 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them were given through sex, which differs from past experiences.
Traditionally, the HIV virus was rapidly expanding by blood transfusions in different parts of China.
But in this way, the number of people suffering is almost zero, they say, representatives of the Ministry of Health of China at the conference held in the province of Ghana.
Nevertheless, the number of people suffering from year to year has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV virus transmission is an important problem in the LGBT community of China.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but discrimination of LGBT persons continues there.
Studies show that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
The disease is transmitted due to the use of wrong ways to protect oneself during sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised that access to AIDS treatment will be universally accessible to this problem.
Maxin Vosters denies the data of the Republican Party sensors from Stef members, calling it as the acting twins, and the theories of notes.
Maxin Walker, a member of the American House of Representatives, rejects the charges reported on Saturdays that his stiff member released three Republican Senate personal information and placed it on Wikipedia pages.
He argued that the accusations were disabled by ultra-right experts and sites.
“The lie, the twins, and even the more sad lies,” says Walters in his statement on Twitter.
The common personal information included address and telephone numbers of South Carolina Senate, Lindsay Graham and Yuta Senators, Mike Lee and Oran Hechi House.
The information appeared on Thursday’s online space by an unknown person. At this time, panel hearing was carried out in the Senate on charges related to illegal court judges, Bret Kavano sexual harassment.
The information was leaked after three Senator asked him questions.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState say the post was uploaded from the IP address associated with the WORP office.
“It’s a groundless charge,” he continues.
My stiff member is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information. We have made a compromise to ensure that their identity, personal information, and security.
“It’s a groundless charge, it’s a false D’s absolute lie.”
Voster’s claim quickly followed by critical assessments, including the former press director of the White House.
The Bible says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.”
It tells us that Worter does not have the need to be a member of the Congress.
When someone blames something that he did not commit, the person does not get angry.
A person does not become stubborn.
A man does not ask questions about the motives of the offender.
But he keeps calm and unsatisfying.
Flesheer seems to compare the reaction of the Uoters to the criticism of democrats against Judge Kawano, who was accused by critics that while listening to Thursday, he would look very angry.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who will run for the United Nations to take the lead in the mid-election elections, as well as voted on his views on Twitter.
“If this is true,” he said.
In his statement, Wroter said that his cabinet warned -her services and law enforcement bodies about this fraud -
“We ensure that the offenders have been revealed,” he continued, “and they are legally responsible for all actions that are devastating and dangerous for any members of my employees”
A review of John Irish's new shot - weak parody by Rouen Atkinson
Now the tradition is to search for the significance of the fashioned Brexit in any new film by British trend, and it seems that it refers to this new version of John England's English-American genre Parody Frances, which began in 2003 with John Izish, and was revived in 2011 by John J. England.
The ironic self-sufficientity should become a new opportunity to export our nation on the subject of what obvious garbage we are?
In any case, a rubber-rich non-competent John Winch License was updated for everything else, and the name is more than anything else that makes it clear that it is a broad comic creature that is designed not for any English-speaking film-rooming areas.
Of course, it is a silly secret agent, regardless of his strange claims towards the light glamour, has a slightly clusto properties, a master flat barbar and an adult Ulf’s qualities that contribute to a single note in the motion of a fire wheelchair in London 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
It is also initially based on a traveler and an international secret man, who starred at Atkinson once on the TV commercials of Barclaycard, which was sown on his way to chaos.
One or two good moments were John English in the last part.
I liked it when John in England came to the middle of his armor to be dressed in the Middle Ages, and the people of the rhetor were cut off on his muzard.
Faces of Atkinson's physical comedy talent, but humor seems slightly weakened and strange, especially when it's seriozoic - movie brands such as 007 and unreliable missions offer us self-confidence as an ingredient.
It's as if humor is designed for children, not for adults, and for me, John English's silly disasters are not as creative and focused as jokes of Atkinson's mute films in Mr. Bin.
Today, the constant current message is that the UK is a serious problem.
Cyber Hacker developed a super secret of British spyes in a superstitious web site, demonstrated the identity of all British field agents, until the concern of the agents, including Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompezic and fighter figure that has been experiencing a full pack of political non-population: Emma Thompson makes a maximum of this quasi-Tergesa-Me character, but there is nothing to work in the stage.
His advisors in the direction of intelligence tell him that because of the fact that every spy is compromised, he should return someone from his pension.
This means to bring John English into the soul, now he is working as a teacher in a well-known facility, but he does not necessarily teach how to become a secret spy: there are several good jokes here when the school in England offers a spy rock-type Academy.
Back in England to the emergency briefing in Wathho, and rejoined his former multi-fected cohort Baspe, who plays again Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, married to the head of a submerged boat, a joyful homeke cover where Vicke Peperdign is slightly lost.
So, in a secret work of his riches, thebetman of the case, and Robin again in action, suddenly, suddenly, meet Olga Curlenko's beautiful fate woman, Ophelia Biletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister becomes dangerous under the jade of the charismatic technological billionaire who claims to settle Britain’s computer trial: an evildoer Jason Volta, who plays Jake Les.
In England and Buffa begin with high lime oils: masking them as waiters, they are fired in a luxurious French restaurant; they create chaos and steal volts on a luxurious yacht; and in England leads to a sacred anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality device to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
All stops, of course, are pulled in this last sequence, but such a benevolent and energetic, like this, quite a little baby TV is for it.
It's a pretty medium thing.
And as well as John Lingish's other films I couldn't be king: can't make British film industry give Rouen Atkinson a role that would really be fair for his talent?
Labour Party rejects the plan for British to work for four days a week and get five days paid
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party discusses a radical plan, according to which British will work on four days a week - but will receive five refunds.
According to the information of the party, the heads of the company should give the savings obtained by artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionization, what they have to spend on their additional day of rest.
So the staff will enjoy three-day bikes, but they will pay the same pay again at home.
Sources report that the idea was to be introduced - the party’s economic agenda and plans to bring the country into favor of employees.
Going to the four-day week already approved by the trade unions as a way for employees to receive benefits from changing economics.
The high-ranking source of the Labour Party was Sandra Tamim, saying: “Let’s revisit policy review this year until the end of this year.
'This will not happen, but the four-day working week is aspiration that corresponds to the party approach, balance the economy in favor of employees, as well as the common industrial strategy of the party.'
The Labour Party is not the first to have this idea, the Greens Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 General Elections campaign.
Aspiration is currently not fully endorsed by the Labour Party, however.
Labour Party representative said: 'We are not a party policy, and it is not considered by a party.'
North Ossetian Chancellor John MacDonel used a conference of the Labour Party's previous week to make his own vision to the socialist economy in the economy.
Mr. MacDonell said he was ready to perform power for the 'Usw directors' and 'specialists' in communal companies.
The North Chancellor plans also suggest that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not fully return their interests because the Labour government may be able to produce a new report on the basis of committed crime.
He also confirmed the plan that the employees put in the company board and create inclusive ownership funds to make 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies, which is equal to the annual dividend in the amount of £500.
Lindsay Graham, John F. Kennedy says 60 minutes, whether the investigation of Federal Bureau will replace them with Kawaano
The investigation of the Federal Bureau concerning the charges against Bret Kawano, at least one week and the process of giving the final vote in relation to its appointment to the Supreme Court and raises questions, whether the Republican Senate forces them to support them.
In the interview of the week Etheer, “60 minutes,” correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the Federal Bureau would be able to share something that could change their opinion.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I’m sorry, of course,,” said Kennedy.
“I said that I would go to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kawano.
I called him after it happened that the charge was announced, I asked, 'You did that mean?'
He was firm, Udreck, unequivocal.
However, the sound of Grammy seems to be intrigued.
“My mind is fully volumeed by Bret Kawaano, and it will be a charge like the dynamite,” he said.
Ford, I know what happened, but I know the following: Bret was strongly denied, adding Graham, referring to what Christine Bless Ford.
“And those who name him cannot confirm this.
That's 36 years old.
I don't see any new change.

Is the idea of free concerts with free concerts to convince people to demand action if there is simply another occasion of so-called cyclistism -- when people think that they make a real difference with online petition signature or via Twitter?

US may use marine forces to block Russia’s energy export - Minister of Internal Affairs
In case of need, Washington can address his marine forces to prevent Russian energy, hit the market, including the Middle East, said US Minister of Internal Affairs, Ryan Zinkem as quoted by Washington Egmeier.
Zinke argued that Russian involvement in Syria - namely, where the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to study new energy markets.
I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to trade with energy, as well as doing in Eastern Europe, on the south of Europe, he said.
And, in official data, there are ways and means to cope with it.
The United States has the capacity to provide for our marine forces, ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, to ensure that we do not carry out their energy on the market, he said.
Zinke applied to the participants of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Union, a non-profit group that portrays itself as a vote for the consumer in the United States.
He went to compare the U.S. approach to Russia and Iran, and he said they literally the same thing.
“Economic option towards Russia and Iran is more or less, the use and change of fuel,,” he said, referring to what Russia has to be one of the specialties, whose economy depends on bovine fuels.
The reports come that Trump administration aims to increase its liquid gas exports in Europe and change Russia, a much cheaper option for European customers.
To do this, representatives of Trump administration, including the US president Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to reject the project of the Nord Strem 2 pipeline, which said Trump, Berlin, Moscow, said.
Moscow has repeatedly highlighted that the 11 billion Nord Street 2 pipelines designed to double the volume of the pipeline, up to 110 billion cubic meters, are a clean economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington’s intense opposition towards the project is simply caused by economic causes and is an example of unfair competition.
It is believed that we share the idea that energy can not be a means to carry pressure and that customers should choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, in Moscow after meeting with US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position led to discontent from Germany, which confirmed its participation in the project.
The German leading organization in the industry, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called the U.S. chapter of the EU’s energy policy and mutual agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply,” said the chairman of German Industry Federals (BDI), Diter Campbell, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the last meeting.

Warren led President Donald Trump while in Mera, saying that he was a country in the wrong direction.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is going on in our democracy,” he said.
In the criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavano was sincere.
On Friday, on Twitter, Warren said, “Of course we need an investigation of the Federal Bureau before giving us a vote.”

US Ambassador to China accuses 'propaganic ads' in 'violability'
A week later, the official Chinese newspaper issued four-page advertising, where US every day requires the total benefits of US-China trade, US Ambassador to China, Beijing accused of spreading propaganda using American press.
U.S. President Donald Trump has recently applied a tea dele-priced supplement in Des Moines Register - Iowa for the most selling state in the newspaper - after China accused, attempting to interfere with the US 6 November Congress election, China denies.
The Trump charges that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, which made it clear what U.S. representatives told Roiter, became a new phase campaign escalation by Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal to place advertising by foreign governments in order to promote trade, now in Beijing and Washington trade war escalation, where they are fermented by tariffs on the importing goods of each other.
China’s response rates were created at the beginning of the trade war to blow up to exporters to the United States such as Iowa, which supports the Republican Party of Trump, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Bronsteind, the US Ambassador to China and the former long governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, says Beijing has been affected by American employees, farmers and businessmen.
Bronstein wrote Des Moines Register on Monday, that China now doubles this violence by spreading propaganda into our free press.
In the spread of the project, the Chinese government enjoys the United States free speech with a tender tradition and free press, Des Moines Registr, writes Brandettide.
Unlike him, here, in Beijing street along the newspaper booth, you will find a limited different opinion and you will not find a real different opinion that may have Chinese people on the transfiguration of the problematic economy of China, which shows that the media is under the heavy writing of the Chinese Communist Party, writes it.

With the failure of Kawano, Republicans are alienized in front of women voters, warning analysts
Before high-ranking republics are in expectation mode and adhere to the highest court candidate Bret Kawano before several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the interim elections they will receive a negative result, especially from women.
The emotions around this were extremely high, and most Republicans have already registered, and they feel that they should go ahead to vote.
In this regard, it is impossible to get back to the opinion,” Grant Rher said, professor of Political Science at the Maxwell University of Maxwell School of Political Science at the Hill, published on Saturday.
Rher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Fleiki (zone) was driven to investigate the federal bureau for the last minute, it would be enough for angry voters to calm down.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget neither tomorrow nor in November,” said Karen Jean-Pirer, a senior adviser of progressive group MoveOn and national speaker on Friday, according to Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, during the demonstration at the Senate Hall, the participants of the campaign were singing, November comes! - When the Republicans who control the Iurdic Committee, decided to take ahead the appointment of Karate, despite the Doct. Christine Blake Ford Display, reported Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be at a very high level,” said Steve Rozenberg, a non-partisan political analisist.
“The people say that it is already high; it is true.
But it can be higher, especially in the suburbs of women and in young voters, from 18 to 29 years, which although the president does not like, often does not participate in elections. ”
Even before the Ford public screenings reflect his accusations on sexual attack, against a higher court candidate, analysts suggest that this comes with negative consequences if the Republicans go ahead with evidence.
“It turned out to be a foolish mess for Republicans,” Michael style said, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, NBC News reported.
It is not just a committee vote, or a final vote, or a dispute on the Caucasus Border, the case is also about how the Republicans took it, and how they came to him, “Sedsil, Director of the US priorities, a group that promotes the choice of democrats, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat disliked by those who need to believe in the formations of the Ford and Kavno, and slightly more supported by the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are necessarily or probably believe in Ford’s trials when 35 states that they are necessarily or probably believing in the Caucasus.
Additionally, 38 percent say that Kawaano is likely or is undoubtedly lying when giving a display when only 30 percent say the same for the Ford.
After pressure from flutes, Federal Bureau currently investigates by Ford, as well as at least one patient, deforative charges were reported by Ramires.
Ford gave a show on the previous week under oath, before the Senate’s legal committee, that Kawanoi was under the state of Nava when he was 17 years old.
Ramesres claims that the High Court candidate showed him a genital body when they were on the party, during the years of teaching at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Network Inventor plans to create a new internet connection to lock Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-L, a world network inventor, starts a new project against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds the energy-open platform of Berlin.
Solid users allow them to choose where their data will be stored and what people have to access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berner-Lee explained that Inrupt’s intention is the world’s domination.
“We have to do this now,” he said.
It's a historical moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to repository their own-personal online data storage - or POD.
This may include contact lists, case list, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and simultaneously.
What makes it unique to personal online data, is that it depends entirely on what kind of information you have to access.
The company calls it “the real authority through data.”
According to John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to establish resources, processes and relevant skills to promote the Solid become accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berlin, Brussels, the IBM sells from a security platform, several employees from developers, with whom the contract was signed to work on the project, and the organization of volunteers.
Starting from this week, technology developers can create their own decentralized applications through tools posted on Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said he and his team did not talk about Facebook and Google, whether they make a full change, where all their business models will be fully sold in one day.
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In the article published on Saturday, Berner-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect integrity and quality of Solid’s new built network.
In 1994, Berner-Lee developed the Internet transformation when he established a world network consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berner-Le was an influential voice in network neutrality debates.
Even at the start of Inrupt, Berner will be the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about this next era of the network,” Berner-Lim added.

Mixed fighting art fans spent nights to watch Bellator for 206 instead of keeping Gochi Peasant
Imagine the whole bold to see you for Bellator 206, and you couldn't see the main event.
San Josee's score included 13 battles, including six main cards, and was screened lively on the United Kingdom, 5 channels.
At 6 p.m., after Gerard Musas and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the audience of the United Kingdom were amazed when the publishers were transferred to the Gochi Peas.
Some of the heartbreakers, after they took them all night specially for this night.
One fan switched to a cartoon with a description of a tweet like something sickly joke.
This is the state regulation that at 6 am this program was inappropriate, so they had to switch to the program, said David Schwartz, the director of Bellator's marketing and communications, when he asked him about the program.
The Bible says: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”
President Scott Coker, President of Bellator, said they work on their schedule to consider the UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think about the replay, I think we might think something, said Coker.
But there are six hours in the morning, week, and we can’t work on it until we spend our time on Sundays, and their time on Monday will not be.
But we're working on it.
Believe me when I changed there many text walked forward and back none of them were friendly.
We've tried to fix this, we thought that was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case of the government.
I give you a promise, then this will not be repeated.
We'll have five battles instead of six -- as we do normally -- we've tried to show them more to fans, and we just had an extra time.
It's a sad situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dele because of sexual orientation - felt
Olympic fragile Tom Dele says that he grew up in comparison with the feeling of depression compared to others, due to his sexual orientation - but this gave motivation to become successful.
He says 24 years old he didn't realize until he went to high school, where he's not all like me.
For the first time, speaking about 4 radios Desert Island Discs, which led to Loren Lavern, he said he spoke about the rights of gays to give others the media. ”
He also said that after the parent became less interested in victory at the Olympics.
The regular anchor of the long show, Kirst Young, led by the illness for several months
The first program of Lavern, Delele said that when she grew up, she felt less than others, because she was not religiousally accepted when boys and girls like you.
He said: “For today, the sensations that I felt less and differently than others were real, which gave me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was something, he said, so he did not disappoint everyone when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
Orgza Olympics became a bronze medal in the famous LGBT campaign and used its appearance on this year's community games in Australia to test homosexuality in the presence of more countries.
He said he made the voice because he was lucky to live openly without things, and he wanted to give others a media.
The champion of the world said that a man fell in love - the U.S. film maker Dartin Les Blake, who met at the 2013 - he was a real witness.
Dele married Oscarosan, who is 20 years older than her last year, but she said that age difference has never been a problem.
When you get out of this age, she played 14 years old at her first Olympics, and her father died of cancer three years later, she said that it was hard to find someone at the same age, who was like a flight and unlucky.
The couple became parents in June, under Robert Ray Bleke-Deil, and Dele says that his family values have changed.
If you were reading this year, the only thing I wanted was to win the gold medal, he said.
You know what, more important things exist than the Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal in Robia.
His father, Robert, who died in 2011, was 40 years old when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Deille said that his father did not accept the fact that he had to die and one of the last things he asked was whether the tickets were London for 2012 - because he wanted to be in front of the previous ranks.
I couldn't say to him 'You wouldn't be in the first row, Father', he said.
I took his hand when he stopped breathing and it did not happen until he really stopped breathing and did not die, I finally failed to realize that he was not immortal,” he said.
In the following year, Deley won the 2012 Olympics and bronze.
I knew that this is what I dreamed of all my life, and I will shout on my own fans in front of the Olympic Games, there was no better sense of it, he said.
This also inspires you to choose your own first song - Proud by Heather Small - which led to resonance with him during the Olympics and is still a stanutil of the Whr.
Desert Island Discs will be BBC Radio 4 on Sundays, 11:15.
Michael Rider's Cup application from the form was hit on Saturday
American Phil Michelson has set up a record on Sunday when he plays on his 4th match on the Rider Cup, but he has to grab the form of this will not turn him into a stage of calamity.
Michaelson, who will take part in the record 12th of the two-year period, enters Captain Jim Furik in the Saturday Forbidden and Forsam.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it was often in the United States, the five-year-old winner of five have taken his own day to be a bird and to work on his game, hoping to correct what he suffers.
Never, the most correct drive, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old ideally does not fit the course of Le Goldf Nasional, a long and rough constantly for the wrong shot of the punish.
And if the course itself is not sufficiently difficult, Michaelson, on the ninth match on Sunday, will compete with the exact British Open First Champion Francesco Moliner, who will compete with the newest Tom Fluffy to win four matches this week.
If Americans begin to match 12 singles in four points, the match will be absolutely important.
Furik expressed confidence toward his man, not that he could say much more.
“He was fully aware of the role he had made today, the hand on his shoulders, and he said to me that he would be ready for tomorrow,” he said.
It's very confident.
He's in the Hall of glory, and he has made a lot of these teams in the past and this week.
I probably couldn't see that he would play two matches.
I'm more tired, but that's what we've done, and that's the way we've thought we'd have to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
On Sunday, Michael will play a record of most matches held on Nick Fedo, Ridder’s Cup.
This can be noted at the end of the career of the Ridder Cup, which would never be considered to be the heights of its individual record.
Michaelson has 18 winnings, 20 failures and seven half, although he said he had his presence to bring some unresponsive sensations.
It's funny, it's sarcastic, tongue, she likes to joke about people, and she's a good type that you should have in your team, explaining it.
I think young players joined him, just like this week that was a good sight.
He offers much more than just a game.
The European Captain Tomas Bourne knows that the big difference could soon disappear
Thomas Bourne, a captain of Europe, knows that the presence of a large number of others in recent singles can be easily turned into an uncomfortable race.
Dein made her debut in 1997 at Valderama, where she was Captain of Steve Balesteros, had five points of advantage with Americans, but the finish line approached by little others, wins what 14 1⁄2-13 1⁄2.
You remind yourself that we had a big difference on Valderama, and we had a big difference in Brooklyn, where we left, and Valderama, where we won, but only said, Bjørn, after 5-3 winnings of 2018, as well as yesterday’s advantage was 10-6 Le Goldf Nasonal.
So the story shows me, and everyone in the team, that's not over.
You will play a full time tomorrow.
Go and do everything you need.
This doesn't end until the points are written on the dashboard.
We have the goal, and that's, try to win the cup, and remain our focus on it.
I've been saying all this time, I'm dealing with 12 players who are on our side, but we know well what stands for on the other side - the world's largest players.
The satisfaction of how his players play in a tense golf match, Bjørn added: “I couldn’t imagine this.
Tomorrow another beast is lying.
Tomorrow, individual speeches are spilled, and this is a different thing.
It's a cool feeling when you stand there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go alone, then you're checking out to go fully as a golf player.
This is the message you need to bring to the player, make your maximum tomorrow.
Now, you have your partner's backsourcing, and he must get out and also reveal his maximum.
Unlike biorrney, Jim Furky is waiting for his players to play individually better than couples, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas who took three points from four to three points.
Fourke himself was at both the end of this previous day’s big coup in both the end of the previous day, which was part of the winning team in Brooklyn until it became defeated when Europe disappeared, the wonders of media.
“I remember every cursed word from there,” he said when he asked how the captain, Ben Crenesoum in 1999 when his players were leading the last day.
We have 12 important matches, but you want to take such a quick start-up as you see in Brooklyn as you see in Medina.
When this momentum takes one direction, it makes much pressure on those middle matches.
We have established our composition in accordance with this, and we put our boys outside, as we felt, you know, we're trying to get some magic tomorrow.
Thomas took his task to resist and meets Rory McCelro's main match with Paul Kes, Justin Rose, John Rem, Tom Figwood and Jan Pulter in the upper half of the Europeans.
I came together with this group of boys because I think it includes all the ways that I'm going to do, \"Born said when choosing his single.
The German new fighting warship was once again delayed
The German fleet had to be adopted in 2014, to replace the fighting warships during the old Cold War period, but its acceptance cannot be managed at least until the next year, due to defective systems and growing costs, reported local media.
-Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading vessel of the new Baden-Wuertemberg class of Freegats, was delayed to the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit quoted the words of military representative.
The ship fleet had to be combined in 2014, but after the problem delivery, the questions have been complicated to complete the ambitious project.
Four pieces of Baden-Wuerttemberg class ship, which was ordered in 2007 to be replaced by the aging Bremen class Frigants.
It is understandable that they will have a strong submechanical, savannato and a series of anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features are long storage periods - it should be possible to place new flies away from home port for two years.
However, constant delays mean that the latest fighting warships - which are designed to strengthen the sea power of Germany - will already be outdated when they engage in the service, notes Die Zeit.
The Avbedite F125 Frigant came into the last year's titles when German fleet officially rejected the ship's adoption and returned it to Blohm & Vosss shipyard factory in Hamburg.
It was the first time German fleet returned to the ship builder after his invitation.
The cause of return is less known, but German media noted a number of important-programming and hardware defects, which would be useless if its fighting mission would be run.
The software defect was particularly important because Baden-Wuertemberg-class ship manages a crew of 120 sailors - only half, the personal composition of the aging Bremen class fragt.
Also, it turns out that the vessel is dramaticly excess weight, which reduces its productivity and inhibits the fleet's ability to add improvements to the future.
7,000 Tonhan-Rheinland-Pfalz - will be twice hard than similar class ships, which Germany used in World War II.
Along with the problem equipment, the price complies with the full project - the installation of crew is another issue.
As they say, amazingly reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - from 2.2 billion euros.
The latest Frigants' accompanying problems are a special meaning in the background of the last warning that the strength of the German fleet decreases.
At the beginning of the current year, Hans-Peter Bartlett, the chairman of the German Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet is actually aware of the ability of deployment ships.
The representative claims that the problem has been sculpted over time, because the ancient ships were removed from the mouth, but the substitute ships have not been torn away.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuertemberg class flies could join the fleet.
National Trust Watches the Secret Life of the Night
A new study carried out in Scotland's mountainous areas aims to find out how nights use landscape to hunt food.
We hope that the discoveries will light the behavior of unique flying mammals, and will help us to understand the activities of the future nature.
The Scottish National Confidence Science research will follow the usual and small nights as a coffee-burning nights, and they will run the nights, invervet gardens, in western Ross.
Special checkboxes will be installed along the main locations of ownership to track night activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also produce moving observations using hand detectors.
The analysis of all voice records by experts will determine the frequency of the daily call rate and which species does it.
Then consists of a habitat map and an account to create a detailed picture of their behaviors across the landscape.
Rob Devar, Scottish National Confidence Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are the most important for nights and how they use each species.
This information will allow you to set the advantages of habitat management works, such as creation of females how to keep the forest seats for nights and more, with their related species.
The population of the nights in Scotland and the United Kingdom has significantly decreased during the last century.
They threaten constructions and development works that affect their nature and loses habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning are also risk containing, as well as adhesive paper and building materials with some chemical means, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The nights are not actually baffles.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the victim.
They use sophisticated ecology techniques to find the location of insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The Scottish National Trust, responsible for over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 77,000 hectares of land throughout the country, the nights are very serious.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out studies, inspection, and sometimes rescue jobs.
The organization also organized the first and only protected area for the first nights of Scotland, on the land of Trivi, in the late-and-glove, which is home to the house of the body from ten nights of Scotland.
Land manager David Tompson says that the land is an ideal area for them.
We have a large area for nights,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees with many good habitats.
But there are many things we don't know about nights, so the work we produce here and other lands will help us understand more about what they need to flourish.
It emphasizes the importance of checking nights before carrying out protection works, because inadvertent destruction of one maternity bush can kill up to 400 and young ones, which will likely lead to the full destruction of local populations.
The nights are protected, and they kill, burn, or bother, or destroy them are illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of night protection trust, built up a community to help them.
He said: “We have to understand a lot more about our nights and our faces, we just don’t know how they live.”

Krishtiman Ronalddu has called the accusations of rape against him, News News,,” states that people should advertise, using his name.
His lawyers intend to complain about German news magazine Der Spiegel, published accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker is charged by the American woman rape, named Catherine Majorga, in the Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He also was accused of paying $375,000 to the incident in order not to vote, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Instagram, speaking about the 142th of Tavvi, several hours after the charges were published, 33-year-old Ronaldo, called the accusations of false stories.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” says the Golden Ball winner before the camera.
-They have to advertise their advertising by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become known by the words of my name, but this is part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and everything is in a row, - he added a player to smile.
Ronaldu’s lawyers are preparing to file a claim against Der Spiegel for the sake of a claim to be accused, which they will be subjected to a broken report based on doubts, in the field of personal life, according to Reuters.

Brext: United Kingdom - loss of automobile manufacturers.
The United Kingdom - because of the loss of the status of the world leader in the production of automobiles, the business secretary Greg Clarke, after Brexit.
He added that the fact that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain will leave the EU without a deal, this will lead to a temporary delay in the production of his factory in Burnaton.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the impact of border delays, in case of non-compliance of the transaction, regards Brexit jobs.
The Bursaton factory (which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis, released about 150,000 cars in the previous year, and their 90% passed exported to other EU countries.
In my opinion, if Britain comes out to the EU and at the end of March, we will review the termination of the production in our factory, said the director of Toyota in Bursaton.
Other automotive manufacturers of the United Kingdom fear to leave the European Union without agreements on the implementation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that it will close its minikarkhana in Oxford after one month after Brexit.
The main issue that concerns the opinions of automotive manufacturers, considers the risks of creating a supply chain in case of carrying out a Brexit deal.
Toyota’s production line is functioning on the basis of so-called “time”, where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes to both EU and United Kingdom suppliers for already ordered cars.
In case the United Kingdom will leave without EU deal on March 29, this may lead to violations on the border that will lead to delays and the definition of parts in the industry.
Toyota would not be able to stop more than one day inventory at its Derbyshaker factory, according to the company, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa Mei Chechen plan on future relations with the European Union is precisely designed to prevent such checks on the border.
We have to get this deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us as we already said, achieve success at this point, and also take this opportunity in the future -- it says BBC Radio 4 Today Program broadcast
Based on the evidence obtained from other manufacturers except Toyota, we definitely need the opportunity to continue to carry out highly successful measures on delivery networks.
Toyota failed to comment on the period of production, but we warned that if it lasts for a long time, this will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Tsuvalris, who worked on the Bursaton facility for 24 years and is the head of a professional union in the factory, says that his members are very worried about this fact. Based on my experience, it is already impossible to restore the lost workplace.
The government spokesperson said: “We presented an accurate and rational plan for our future relationships with the EU.”
According to the White House, Trump’s meeting can be postponed again
According to the announcement made by the White House on Sunday, Donald Trump’s high-ranking meetings with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Roznstein could be postponed for the next week, because the battle with the Supreme Court still continues

At the beginning of the current month, during an interview with New York Time, Rozenstein stated that he discussed the use of hearing equipment to talk to Trump, and the possibility to reuse the president based on the 25th correction.
Rozenstein refused to report this account (report).
On the previous Monday he came to a white house, and due to the score he planned to resign.
Therefore, meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York City, was appointed on Wednesday

On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct one week investigation of the complaint against the FBI, and then resigned at the Senate plenary session.

Regarding meeting with Rozenstein, he said: “The exact date has not yet been established, the notice may be indicated this week, my opinion is to delay the meeting related to the current issues of the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and we'll definitely inform the media news
Several Reporters are going to appeal to the approveds: Sanders did not hold a brifting white house after 10 September.
The host was interested in this reason.
As stated by Sanders briefing failures are not connected with television-reportion-making, but he also added: “I agree that this action is designed to achieve a special effect..”
Later, he said that the immediate connection between Trump and mass media will increase.
The President conducts more Q&A sessions than his predecessor presidents, added a respodent, and added evidence without quote: “We look at their ravings.”
According to Sanders, briefings will be held in the future, but if the press has a chance to directly ask the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot, and as you can see in the last few weeks a great job, and we also plan to conduct briefings, where you will be able to directly talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly listens to questions when leaving a white house or participates in open sessions and high ranking press conferences.
Special press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York City, the president is expected to demonstrate why ideas are free to generate and display the original image before the reports gathered.

According to the study Saturday, 17.30 p.m. is a wonderful time for pints
The summer hottester Niav has increased the revenue of British pabs, but it has been loaded to monitor networks.
Sales in Pabe and Bar increased by 2.7 percent in July - but income in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to the calculations conducted.
Peter Martin, a CGA business consultant who conducted this calculation, says: “The warm weathers and the participation of the unexpected world Cups in England would promise the presence of the same indicators in July, which in the previous month when the club income increased by 28 percent, while the restaurants saw a greater loss.
In June, the reduced rate of restorney sales by 1.8 percent has worsened in July.
Drinking traders pabbies and bars have developed their positions in proportion to the drop of restaurants indicators.
Traders with food products suffered due to heat, but not so seriously compared to restaurant operators.
At first glance, citizens simply wanted to drink.
When the sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent per month, the sales of food products were reduced by three percent.
RSM’s tourism analyst Paul Newman said: these results continue the trend established by us at the end of April.
The weather and the impact of the main social or sports events is the most important factors in regard to sales in the domestic market.
Of course, groups of restaurants will continue to fight because their sales are reduced by 4.8 percent per year, which is especially painful for the background of the taxation of current payments.
Long hot summer is not a good time for food vendor operators and time shows us whether a moderate temperature expected in August will be removed.

Redhead pump advertising where the mother wears the cow, shares the opinion online
Tumblo company has shared its opinion on the Internet by advertising that compares to the cows of nursing mothers
To celebrate a new beginning, as they say, the world's first Chum T-shirt pump, the consumer technology company Elvie released a promotional video in the style of music video, which is used to show freedom, which gives a new pump for nursing mothers.
Four real mothers who dance in a cow full of cows full of cows in the background of the song, which includes the following words: \"Yes, I'm a milk myself, but you don't see the tail -- and if you don't notice it, these are not glands, it's my girlfriends --
The team continues: “Dutumbe, pop up, I gave it to children, get rid of it, get rid of me, I like my ladies.”
However, an ad published on the company’s Facebook page led to the confrontation online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed reaction from the viewers, and many said that it would light the fan of the dairy industry's industry's industry's industry's innovations.
It was a very bad decision to use cows in the advertisement of this product.
In fact, they should be pregnant and give birth to the need to separate milk, except that their children take away several days after the emergence of their children - writes one
Elvie's hip pump is irreplaceable in the nursing Lif (Elvie / Mother)
One more commentary: “It’s a traumatistic for both mother and child.
But why should they not be used in the advertising of the pump of their chest, for those who appear to be a child -
Someone added: When unplaced advertising.
Others were wearing ad. One woman admits that she was singing-in-a-separably -- she showed her.
I think that's a genius idea.
I had to be a nursing one.
I felt like a real cow.
Advertising is a bit crazy, but I got it as it was.
This is a genius product -- writes one.
Another commentary: This is a fun advertising for mothers who are burning milk (often in their workplace or in the toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that focuses on or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video it shows that women dance with hidden pumps in liquids.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that most women who are burning say they feel cows.
And Elvie's pump is completely voiced, does not have wires or pipes and it turns into a lif, which allows women to move freely, hold their hands to children and even get out.
Ana Balarine, partner and ECD mother does comment on the following: “Elvie’s pump is so revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative launch.
When the paralysis between women's self-expression and wild cows, we wanted to remove milk from the mammals and get all its problems in the center of attention, during which entertainment and interesting ways demonstrate the feeling of incredible freedom, which will give a new pump.
This is not the first time when Elvie pump hit the news titles
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on Podium designer Martha Jabakovsky during the use of the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent camp near Texas border
The number of busy migrant children increased dramatically, however, the crossing of monthly border remained relatively intact, in part because the Trump administration introduced strict rhetoric and politics, which made it difficult for children to place sponsors of children
Traditionally, most sponsors were self-disputable migrants who were afraid to threaten their country’s opportunity to stay in their country while taking a step forward to the child’s request.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family would have to submit fingerprints, and their data would be transferred to immigration bodies.
Last week, Matthew Albes, High Representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, confirmed that the agency was arrested by tens of people who requested sponsorship of homeless non-financials.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the busy were not previously committed to crime.
Some 80 percent of those who are members of sponsors or sponsors are illegal in the country and their significant part is criminal residents.
So we continue to fight this people, said Mr. Albes.
In order to accelerate the process of children, new rules were presented by officials, according to which some of them should be submitted to the court within a month after their detention, not 60 days after the previous standards were provided according to the shelter workers
Many will appear through video conferences and not personally to announce their legal status to the judge of immigration.
The one who is not subject to help, urgently deport.
According to the report of shelter workers and reports, which emerged over the last months of the system, as long as children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will become energated or depressed, which can lead to violent manifestations or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems have strengthened larger institutions, such as Tornike, where signs that the child fights with difficulties are more likely to understand, depending on his size.
They also added that without giving enough time for emotional training for children and giving them peace of mind, they can be more fueled by trauma that most of them have already fought.
Syria commands US, France and Turkey’s occupation forces to take their troops immediately.
In the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Valid Al-Mule also called for return to Syrian refugees, despite the fact that the war of the country lasts for the eighth year
Muralem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally illegal in the Syrian land, with the excuse for fighting terrorism and were considered to be considered as a basis for the fight against terrorism.
They should get out immediately and without any conditions - he told the congregation.
Muralem argued that the war of Syria was almost complete, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have been expelled from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until the whole area of Syria will be released from terrorist groups and from any illegal foreign existence. ”
The United States have some 2,000 military soldiers in Syria, mainly preparing and teaching both the heavier forces and the Syrian Arabs, who oppose the President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1000 soldiers in the war-torn land.
As for refugees, Mulleem said that their return conditions were good, and he blamed the Western country, which spreads the economic fear - which prompted refugees to return to the country
We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote their return - he said.
It is apolist that only needs to be a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not receive help to restore until the political agreement for the end of war will occur between Asad and opposition.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement on creation of a buffer zone between Russia and Turkey, in the last major rebel forces of the Ddilbe, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement lifted Russia’s backed, a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Muamle emphasized that the agreement had a clear dates, and she expressed hope that military actions would be directed against Jihadites, including the Nusra front fighters related to Al-Qaida, which were eliminated.
The UN representative Schatpan de Mission hopes to soon invite the first session of the new committee, in which representatives of government and opposition will enter to develop a further constitution of war for Syria and the elections.
Muamle determined the terms of participation in the Syrian government in the committee and stated that the Commission’s activities should be covered by the review of the article of the current Constitution, and warned against the interventions.
Why Trump wins for the second term
With this logic, Mr. Trump wins new elections in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers hope, impachment and scandals will not complete its presidency as prematurely.
What's going to be, without any doubt, - The most dramatic final of the Presidentship!
At this moment there are no signs of fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, Prime-ta has doubled ratings on CNN to 1.05 million and almost three times increased to MSNBC -1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News is an average of 2.4 million Prime-Taim viewers, which has been 1.7 million compared to 4 years ago, and MSNBC’s-Reichel Mendous show has over 3.5 million cable channels rankings on the main news evening.

There's also entertainment value in Chaos.
Of course, in addition to the other rest in television, the U.S. can be determined by the future of Ros V. Weid, whether it is possible to combine migrant families and health of global economy.
Hang off - it's a luxury that only a privileged viewers can.
And yet, this goes beyond the notion of an informed citizen, when you see the debates of the expert group used by Bob Vodord in his book, Paul Manafort of $ 15,000 worth of Siraclema's leather bomber's coat (the clothes covered from medicality - as said Washington Fost) and the consequences of the harsh descriptions of Stormi denelli's harsh descriptions about Trump's Anatomy.

When I reached Mr. Fleis this week, there was a sunny day with a temperature of 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Chaos, but he was sitting at home at MSNBC during CNN recording.
He could not get rid of, nor from Bret Kawaano, who was nominated before the Senate court committee and before the Supreme Court in the future, which was hanging on the thread.
I remember when we did those crazy shows today, and people said, \"This is the end of Western civilization -- Mr. Fleis told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.

Beyond money, it turned into a tough interim election of the Revolution house.
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania suffers from the flow of money, thanks to the restructure of the district election districts of Congress, which took two positions in the fight for the same place.
This newly rebuilt suburban Pittsburg district covers a member of the Chamber of Representatives of Democracy, conor Lemb - who won a special election in the second round last spring.
Lembe goes against another official, Republican case against Rothmus, which currently represents 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which partially coincides with the new 17th of the 17th.
Maps have been changed when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January has proven that the old districts were formed in non-constitutional in favor of republics.
In the 17th new round led to the reduction of the campaign funding of the parties’ financial department, the Democratic Congress Commission (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lembe became known in Pennsylvania, after a narrow victory in the general election in March, in 18th district of Pennsylvania
This place was occupied by Republican for decades, and President Donald Trump won 20 points.
Political experts give a slight advantage of democrats.
The United States for China Support The penalty for El Salvador has been canceled
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama admitted a slight militia from Beijing Washington
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners settled the management team of Trump organization.
Representatives of the State Department decided to return the US diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, due to the recent decision on the rejection of Taiwan’s recognition, the spokesperson of the Department Hizer Navert at the beginning of this month.
But the fines were provided only for El Salvador, who received $ 140 million with the help of the U.S. in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Suggested fines that include a reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions will be painful for Central American countries and its high level of unemployment and murder
Local meetings in accordance with the development of North American and Central American officials have moved to a high level conference focused on security and economic well-being, as a step forward to avoid migration in the United States.
But for the middle of September, the higher officials of the administration clearly noted that they wanted to go to the conference and actually stop discussing the fines for the Salvatore.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Remind will now deliver a conference, which is planned in mid-October as a sign that the administration will change the places of assembly.
And three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, without the new strict notifications and punishment of Washington.
The spokesperson of the White House Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports have been confirmed by a third-party analyst who is near the administration and also talked about the conditions of anonymity.
History Study
The next step can be a report of a special lawyer Robert Meller on possible elaboration of Mr. Trump justice, which is quite significant evidence in public reports today.
B.N. Muler also reported that his investigation was applied to you, whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was in conspiratulation with Russia during our elections.
If the Congress has moved from the hand, then Mr. Trump himself turns out to be accountable, just as he prepares to talk with voters, and, in the end, before the jury of his colleagues.
It's very much, and I don't mean that Mr. Trump's falling inevitable - as well as its equivalents in Europe.
We all make choices on both sides of Atlanta, which will affect the duration of the fight.

We'll go out and let us get the opportunity to avoid blood transfusions.
The course of history spins around such inflation and speeds up in an unconcerned march of democracy or delays
Americans today face this turning point.
What will we do if Mr. Trump releases from the position of General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, a person who controls the fate of Mr. Meller's investigation?
Rosenstein is already in hot water, after the newspaper reported that in the last year he decided to secretly sign up for the president and talked about his unsuitable position
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
-How to respond if you have recently requested F.B.I. investigations about Bret Kawalo is not complete or fair - or if he has confirmed the Supreme Court, regardless of the trusted accusations due to sexual abuse and unscrupulous evidence?
And first of all, will the average vote for the Congress that Trump will bring justice?
If we put this exam, democracy will continue with a long winter period.
But I believe we'll be able to take a lesson that I'll go to Prague.

Diana Feinstein, did you share information?
Do you remember his answer... not heard a letter -- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.

Bond's daughter Karen Jiankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says a letter: “It's hard to imagine someone else's being used to read it for the first time before it is published.
Now it's very fun to know that we know about the huge success of Pedington.
Of course his father, who worked as a BBC operator until he was inspired to write a book on a small gaming calculation, would be optimistic, because his work was rejected and added that 60-year-old-old-nine-thought was one year after his death.
About Pedington, who referred to it as a very important member of our family, he added that his father is silent to separate his possible success.
It was quite a quiet man, and he was not like a man - he said.
“But because Pedington was such a real thing for him, almost as if you had a child who describes any success: you are proud of him, but in reality this is not your own case.
I think he considered the success of Pedington so much.

Bret Kavano's future base, FBI starts investigation.
I thought we could do what he was asking -- a limited investigation in time, within limited framework -- we could have some unity -- he said Mr. Fleck on Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the committee will be left on the party's blink.
Why didn't Mr. Kakalo and his republic support FBI investigation?
They didn't have their desire because of their time.
By mid-elections will take place in five weeks, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans’ case will go badly, they will seriously weaken those attempts to get the person who should opt for the country’s highest court.
George Bush took his phone and called Senatories and called them to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in a white house during Bush, and that he met his wife Ashley when he worked as a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after FBI prepares his account?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where now sits 51 Republicans and 49 democracy.
There is still no clear whether Mr. Kawano will receive at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to forget the connection and prove it to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean apostates is under the ark
Since Kim Chenin came to power seven years ago, the number of apostates from North Korea has decreased in South Korea, said South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, based on the data of the South Union Ministry, stated that in the past year there were 1,127 apostates, compared to 2,706 apostates.
According to Mr. Park, the tightening of border control between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by contrasts were important factors.
Pyoyang did not make public comments.
The vast majority of apostates from the North eventually offer South Korea’s citizenship
In Seoul, it is estimated that more than 30,000 of those who finished the Korean War after the Korean War were completed in 1953.
Most of China via the membrane, which has the longest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than a reliable demolitarized zone between two Korea (DMZ).
China considers apostates as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often their forced repatriation is better.
The relationship between North and South countries, which is still in the state of war, has greatly improved during recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met with each other in Pionggang, who would concentrate on the nuclei dissipation.
This happened in Singapore after a historical meeting of the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Johnson June when they generally agreed to work on the Korean U.S. Communist Peninsula.

Nancy Pelossi calls Bret Kawanos-Sterian, and said he was not suited to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader Nancy Pelosy, the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kawano, calls the Ministerial -- and said he was not suited to work in the Supreme Court due to temperament.
Pelos made a comment at the Texas Tribune Festival in the interview on Saturday, Texas Tribune Festival.
I couldn't do it, but I think that if a woman had to do it, she was called hysterical -- according to pelosim's reaction to a Canadian display committee in front of the Senate justice committee.
Kavnage emotionally denied accusations that he had sexual relations with Dr. Christina Ble Ford in youth.
His introduction to his speech was very emotional, sometimes almost shouted and kept talking about his family and school periods.
He also condemned democracy in the committee and called his father-in-law as a coordinated murder of gratification and characters, which was organized by angry liberals that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pilos said that his opinion, Kawano's testimony confirmed that he could not work at the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is biased against democracy.
I think he will disqualify himself with these statements, and in the way he went to Clinton and Democrats - he said.
Pelos was angry when he asked him whether he would try to determine whether he will act as a mechanism if he will rise up, and whether democrats will receive the majority in the House of Representatives.
I say so -- if he does not tell the truth about the convention or FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is now present -- - said pelosim.
Kavano is now a judge of the District Court of Appeals of Colombia.
Peloss has added that as a democracy, it is concerned about the potential solutions available in the medical aid law or Roy V. Veid, because it is considered a conservative judge.
On hearing of the issue of approval of his position, Kano prevented questions, discarding whether he makes any decisions about the Supreme Court.
It's not the time when hysterical, biased people will come to court, and they will have the expectations that we will say, \"What a wonderful thing is,\" says Piloma.
And women should use it.
It's a fair conversation for months and years, and it's not able to show her without crying.
“We’re waiting for us when we get angry,” she told me, “Steine after 45 years.
I don't think it's unusual, you're --
He continued: “I helped a woman who was somewhere in the government, who said she was also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she tells a man who would talk to him: “You might think that I'm bored because I'm a vitri.
I'm angry.
And then he just continued his way.
And I thought it's wonderful.
Tears are partly allowed to express anger, because it is fundamentally incorrectly understood.
One of my most bitter memories on my early job, where men dominated, was when I first discovered that I had once found a rat because of unsigned anger, one old lady on a chuck -- one of the cold managers, whose always was afraid - and I got up on the stairs.
You never saw Tir -- he told me.
They do not know that you are angry.
They think you're bored, and they're happy that they've got what they wanted.
Patricia Schreder, at the time of the Colorado Democratic Congressman, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart caught a marriage without a connection, named Monkey Business, and left the race, the lady Schreder, very disappointed, decided that there is no reason why he should not take a candidate for his presidency.

It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000, gave him only $250.
They think that I get a discount, and it was interested in it.
When he came out of the word and said that he would not start a formal campaign, he could feel so much - appreciation for the people who supported, disappointment in the system, which made him feel difficult for finding funds and orientation to voters rather than on delegates, and Brazi’s sex- that he would survive.

How can China be good for US-China Trade War
The initial causes of trade between the US and China have been reported, and before the end of the battle is further far away, the debates between countries in the long run can be beneficial for Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the U.S. President, threw the first warning at the beginning of this year, with the basic Chinese export tax establishment, including solar paneles, Poti and Alumiin.
The most important escalation began this week with new tariffs that influenced $200 billion (150 billion pound sterling) value items, effectively taxing what, half of all goods that enter the USA from China.
Beijing has responded to every time, at least five to ten percent of the tariffs on the total cost of 60 billion US goods.
China promised that the U.S. will be corrected by the eye circle, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to be at any time in the nearest period.
The U.S. force to pull back means to meet the demand, Magra, to speak publicly to the U.S., could be very awkward for the president of China, for S. D. Winpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing forces correctly play their tents, the pressure of the US trade war can positively affect China in a long period of time, by reducing the relationship between two economics.
The fact that the rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing may create conditions to start economic decline in any country is actually much more dangerous than the observers had previously received,” says Gugeil Grayis, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia, a new American security center, an analytical center.
