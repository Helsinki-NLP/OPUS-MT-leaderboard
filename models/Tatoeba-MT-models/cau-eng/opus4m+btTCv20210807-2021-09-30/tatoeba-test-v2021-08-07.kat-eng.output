Ioto!
You like elephants.
You can invite everyone to this festival.
You need my permission
You're opening the door.
You're going to rise up.
You're a beautiful girl.
You're now a teacher.
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful.
You're beautiful.
You're amazing!
You're Emily.
It's inside.
You're in.
You are in Europe!
You're now lying to me.
You're not a doctor.
Don't listen.
You don't have permission to do it here.
You're sad.
You're sad.
You're sick!
You're wrong.
You're too low.
You're too low.
You're too low.
You're too low.
Nothing.
Your mother is very beautiful!
That's you say!
You learn English.
You tried.
You were not tired.
Be tired.
You're tired.
It's never started in its company.
